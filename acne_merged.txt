Title: Recognising cutaneous tuberculosis

Abstract: SummaryTuberculosis (TB) continues to be a leading cause of death in many countries, and also remains a significant concern in Germany, particularly due to migration. The diagnosis of rare cutaneous tuberculosis is challenging as it manifests in various clinical forms that resemble more common dermatological conditions.Especially in paucibacillary forms, gold‐standard diagnostic tests may yield negative results, complicating the identification of the disease. Therefore, a strong clinical suspicion based on the clinical presentation is essential for guiding further or repeated diagnostic evaluations.In this article, we present various forms of cutaneous tuberculosis, using excerpts from the image collection of the Department of Dermatology and Allergy at Biederstein, Technical University of Munich, to improve clinical recognition of cutaneous TB and raise awareness of this condition also as a potential differential diagnosis.

Body: CURRENT EPIDEMIOLOGY
      With 1.3 million deaths per year, tuberculosis is the second leading common infectious cause of death worldwide. Approximately 25% of the global population is latently infected; however, only 5%–10% develop tuberculosis requiring treatment. In 2022, 10.6 million new cases requiring treatment were reported.

 is a relatively rare manifestation. However, given the global disease burden of tuberculosis infections, this still accounts for at least 150,000 cases. In high‐prevalence countries, cutaneous TB accounts for approximately 2% of dermatology consultations. One‐third of patients with cutaneous TB also have systemic involvement, emphasizing the critical role of dermatologists in diagnosis.
      More than half of the world's tuberculosis cases occur in five countries: India, Indonesia, China, Pakistan, and the Philippines.

 Tuberculosis in Germany is mainly diagnosed in patients with a background of migration. In 2022, more than 4,000 new cases of tuberculosis were reported, 71% of which occurred in persons of foreign nationality.

 Tuberculosis control has been hindered in recent years not only by the HIV epidemic and antibiotic resistance, but also by the reallocation of attention and recources during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

      In 2022, $ 5.8 billion was invested in tuberculosis prevention and treatment globally–more than 10% less than in 2019. This decline may be linked to the recent increase in case numbers.
1


    
    
      PATHOGENESIS
      The most common causative agent of tuberculosis is Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis, followed by the less common M. bovis and the BCG bacillus (an attenuated M. bovis strain used for vaccination). These are aerobic, immobile, non‐spore‐forming, facultatively intracellular rod‐shaped bacteria.
      The high lipid content of the cell wall makes these tubercle bacilli highly resistant and accounts for their acid and alcohol fastness. In most cases, transmission is airborne. Intact skin acts as an effective protective barrier and tubercle bacilli can only penetrate through microtrauma.
10


      Within 6–8 weeks, the pathogen is either eliminated or encapsulated in individuals with a well‐functioning immune system. This initial phase is usually asymptomatic. Occasionally, an erythema nodosum (up to 10%) or flu‐like symptoms may occur.
11


      Immune status plays a critical role in shaping the clinical presentation of tuberculosis. The interaction between the immune system and Mycobacterium tuberculosis can result in bacterial elimination, containment by granuloma formation, or uncontrolled bacterial spread as seen in miliary tuberculosis. The defense mechanisms against Mycobacterium involve both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) play a key role in the innate immune response by recognizing pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and upregulating antimicrobial peptides.
12
, 
13
 Granuloma formation is a coordinated aggregation of various immune cells, primarily macrophages, which fuse into multinucleated giant cells, along with lymphocytes. Mycobacteria infect dendritic cells and macrophages, inhibiting phagosome maturation through serine/threonine kinases. By inactivating reactive oxygen species and preventing phagolysosome fusion, the tubercle bacilli can proliferate in this environment.
13
 An “effective” granuloma encapsulates the bacteria, shielding them while also preventing their spread. Among the lymphocyte subpopulations, interferon‐γ‐producing Th1 lymphocytes have proven to be crucial for controlling TB‐causing mycobacteria. Likewise, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), produced by Th1 cells and other immune cells, plays a key role in granuloma formation and the caseous necrosis characteristic of tuberculosis.
12
, 
14
 This process upregulates matrix metalloproteinases, which are key drivers of the distinctive tissue destruction seen in tuberculosis.
15
 In addition, Th17 cells play a significant role in the formation and maintenance of granulomas.
13
 The formation of granulomas is the body's attempt to control the infection. However, if the infection is not contained, it can lead to tissue damage and the characteristic symptoms of tuberculosis.
16


      Therefore, a “mature granuloma” represents a “stalemate” between the immune response and mycobacteria. Both immune status and nutritional conditions can significantly influence this balance. Likewise, the manifestations and severity of cutaneous tuberculosis are strongly shaped by the individual immune status of the patients.
    
    
      DIAGNOSIS
      The diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis includes immunological tests, direct pathogen detection methods, resistance testing, and dissemination assessment. A definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis requires pathogen detection by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ideally, three 6‐mm punch biopsies should be taken from the lesion for culture, PCR, and histological examination.
17
, 
18
 Due to the slow replication rate, cultural growth takes 6–8 weeks, depending on the medium, and is always accompanied by antibiotic susceptibility testing.
19
, 
20
 Additionally, PCR, which is more reliable from fresh tissue, allows for pathogen detection as well as the identification of common resistance‐associated mutations.
17
 Acid‐fast bacilli can only be detected histologically once a sufficient bacterial load is present, for example, using Ziehl‐Neelsen staining, which explains the low sensitivity for the identification of TB in histological examinations.
      With a well‐functioning immune response, the body forms tuberculous granulomas composed of epithelioid cells and multinucleated Langerhans giant cells. At the center of these granulomas, caseous necrosis of varying extent is present, while the peripheral zone is characterized by surrounding lymphocytes. In contrast, with a weakened immune response, only a nonspecific inflammation is observed, initially dominated by neutrophilic granulocytes and gradually shifting toward a predominance of lymphocytes and macrophages over time.
21
, 
22


      In multibacillary TB, pathogen detection is usually successful, and immediate patient isolation is required. Paucibacillary forms cannot be reliably excluded even with negative staining, PCR, or culture results. Repeated testing may be necessary.
      The following two tests indicate whether the organism has already had an immunological response to tuberculosis: In the T‐SPOT test, circulating lymphocytes in the blood are incubated with antigens of the M. tuberculosis complex, and the release of interferon‐γ is then measured.
23
 The significantly more cost‐effective tuberculin skin test is a delayed‐type reaction to intradermally injected protein derivatives of mycobacteria. There is an inherent risk of false‐negative results in cases of immunodeficiency as well as false‐positive results after vaccinations when using the tuberculin skin test.
24


      The most important risk factor for tuberculosis is HIV infection; therefore, corresponding tests should also be conducted.
25


      For further diagnostic evaluation of disease spread, we refer to the guidelines.
    
    
      TREATMENT
      The treatment of cutaneous tuberculosis is identical to that of pulmonary tuberculosis. Here, too, susceptibility testing before initiating therapy is considered mandatory, for example using a PCR‐based rapid resistance testing method. For adults, the recommended standard therapy remains unchanged: Isoniazid (INH), rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide are administered in combination for 2 months, followed by a four‐month continuation phase with isoniazid and rifampin.
5
, 
25
 Regular monitoring of the most common side effects, such as hepatitis, neuritis, neuropathy, hyperuricemia, and thrombocytopenia, is required. The treatment regimen does not differentiate between tuberculids and other forms of cutaneous tuberculosis. A therapeutic response is expected within 4–6 weeks, with complete healing of the lesions occurring within 1–5 months.
22
, 
26
 While antibiotic resistance in tuberculosis is increasing worldwide, the situation in Germany has remained stable at a low level, with a resistance rate of 5.7% in 2022.
6


      Of particular concern is multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB), which is resistant to the two main drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. Treatment should be carried out in specialized tuberculosis centers. Currently, MDR‐TB is treated with a regimen of at least 6 months using bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin (BPaLM regimen). Rifampin monoresistance is treated following the same protocol as MDR‐TB.
5


      In cases with complications or additional resistance, an individualized treatment regimen with at least four drugs from WHO Groups A to C should be administered for 18 months, based on the resistance profile.
27
 Additional resistance includes pre‐XDR‐TB, characterized by resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, and fluoroquinolones, as well as XDR‐TB, which also exhibits resistance to bedaquiline or linezolid.
      Even in second‐ and third‐line therapy, side effects must be actively monitored. In the case of abscessing forms, surgical debridement may be beneficial. Multibacillary forms with ulcerations and fistulas are considered open tuberculosis, and these patients should be isolated.
28
 After one month of adequate therapy, most patients are considered non‐infectious, similar to pulmonary TB.
29


    
    
      CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
      Prior sensitization of the patient's organism to mycobacteria, the cellular immune response, the route of infection, and the virulence of the respective mycobacteria determine the clinical manifestations of cutaneous tuberculosis. Due to its complexity, various classifications of clinical manifestations exist (Table 1). The two major groups, multibacillary and paucibacillary forms, are highly dependent on the patient's cell‐mediated immunity. It is also crucial whether the initial contact with tuberculosis occurs through the skin (primary), whether a specific immune response has already developed and a primary complex has been established (post‐primary), or whether the condition represents an immunological reaction of the skin to organ tuberculosis (tuberculid). The clinical presentation of cutaneous tuberculosis is also determined by the route of infection, which may be exogenous by inoculation or endogenous via lymphatic, hematogenous, or per continuitatem spread.

      MULTIBACILLARY FORMS
      
        Primary tuberculous complex (tuberculous chancre)
        This initial contact with tubercle bacilli through direct penetration of the skin or mucosa is very rare, occurring in 0%–1% of cutaneous TB cases.
30
 Portals of entry include microtraumas, but preexisting dermatoses can also sufficiently impair the barrier function. This cutaneous primary infection, occurring in the absence of specific immunity, is primarily observed in children with close contact with tuberculosis patients.
        After 2–4 weeks, a painless, firm, inflammatory papule appears, which may progress to ulceration. Lymph node swelling typically occurs 3–8 weeks after infection, often followed by caseation, though this is not always present.
31


        Healing usually occurs within 3 to 12 months, leaving an atrophic scar. In particular, without treatment, progression to another clinical form of cutaneous tuberculosis is possible.
        
Differential diagnoses: Syphilitic primary lesion, swimming pool granuloma, nocardiosis, tularemia, actinomycosis, leishmaniasis, subcutaneous and opportunistic fungal infections.
      
      
        Ulcerative tuberculosis of skin and mucosa (Orificial tuberculosis)
        In patients without significant immunity and with open organ tuberculosis, autoinoculation may develop along natural body orifices. This rare form accounts for up to 2.1% of cutaneous tuberculosis cases.
30
, 
32


        Initially, an erythematous papule appears, which transforms into one or more punched‐out, non‐healing, soft ulcerations with skin or mucosal edema. The most common sites of bacterial seeding in cases of open pulmonary tuberculosis are the hard palate, tongue, and lips (Figure 1).
33

            Orificial tuberculosis with ulceration of the tongue resulting from the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis.
          
          
        
        Intestinal tuberculosis with perianal bacterial seeding, as well as urogenital tuberculosis with dissemination along the urinary tract, have also been observed. These often painful ulcerations can significantly impair eating, urination, or defecation, depending on their location.
        
Differential diagnoses: Ulcerative sexually transmitted infections, leishmaniasis, amebiasis, histoplasmosis, herpes simplex virus infection, squamous cell carcinoma, chronic recurrent aphthae, pemphigus vulgaris, acrodermatitis enteropathica, and irritant‐toxic dermatitis.
      
      
        Tuberculosis cutis colliquativa (Scrofuloderma)
        This form has a relatively high prevalence in endemic areas (71% vs. 2.8% in non‐endemic areas)
34
, 
35
 and primarily occurs in children and the elderly. It is defined by the contiguous spread of tubercle bacilli from a deep‐seated infectious focus to the skin. The most common source is a lymph node, classically in the neck (Figure 2a,c). However, scrofuloderma can also arise from infections in bones or joints (Figure 2b) or, rarely, from the testes. One or more cold abscesses develop, palpable as deep‐seated nodules, which eventually drain to the skin surface through fistulas and ulceration with caseous, purulent discharge. The ulcer margins often appear livid and undermined.

(b) Ulcerations with livid, undermined margins due to contiguous spread from bone tuberculosis. (c) Cold abscess originating from an infected lymph node.
          
          
        
        Through scarred healing of old lesions while new ulcerations and fistulas continue to emerge, a striking clinical appearance can develop (Figure 2a). The scars have a suture‐like appearance. Secondary spread from the ulcer margins into the dermis is not uncommon, manifesting as lupus vulgaris.
        
Differential diagnoses: Tertiary syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum, subcutaneous or opportunistic fungal infections, other mycobacterial infections, actinomycosis, pyodermas, hidradenitis suppurativa, severe acne conglobata, and tumor metastases.
      
      
        Tuberculosis cutis miliaris disseminata (disseminated cutaneous tuberculosis)
        Miliary tuberculosis is a severe and rare form (0%–11%),

 and in children.
        It is characterized by massive hematogenous dissemination and seeding of tubercle bacilli in the skin and multiple other organs.
        It is often associated with advanced pulmonary tuberculosis accompanied by pronounced B symptoms. The clinical spectrum is wide, presenting with numerous polymorphic papules, overlying vesicles and pustules, as well as necrosis or atrophic scarring. Lesions typically heal with scarring within 1–4 weeks. The trunk and extremities are primarily affected, though mucosal involvement is possible.
        
Differential diagnoses: Exanthems (infectious, parainfectious, or drug‐associated), secondary syphilis, varicella, rickettsiosis, pityriasis lichenoides variants, and Abt‐Letterer‐Siwe disease.
      
      
        Metastatic tuberculous abscesses (tuberculous gummas)
        Tuberculous gummas have primarily been reported in malnourished children or immunosuppressed adults, accounting for 0%–13% of cutaneous tuberculosis cases.
16
, 
39
 Hematogenous dissemination of tubercle bacilli is followed by local metastatic spread, leading to abscess formation, which may ulcerate or develop fistulas (Figure 3).
        
          FIGURE 3
          
            Tuberculous gumma appears as an abscess in the skin, without connection to deeper tissues.
          
          
        
        The clinical presentation may therefore resemble scrofuloderma, but tuberculous gummas are not connected to deeper infectious foci. Localized lymphadenopathy is usually absent.
        
Differential diagnoses: Infection with other mycobacteria, syphilitic gummas, subcutaneous or opportunistic fungal infections, hidradenitis suppurativa, and panniculitides.
      
    
    
      PAUCIBACILLARY FORMS
      
        Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis (butcher's wart tuberculosis)
        In cases of reinfection through the skin, tuberculosis verrucosa cutis develops in patients with prior exposure to tubercle bacilli and a well‐functioning immune system, accounting for 3%–19% of cutaneous tuberculosis cases.
35
, 
39


        Historically, the disease was more common in high‐risk occupations such as healthcare workers and butchers and was recognized as an occupational disease. Today, it primarily affects children. Through microtraumas, the bacilli can breach the protective skin barrier. Transmission may also occur via objects contaminated with infected saliva. Consequently, in addition to the hands, the feet, knees, and buttocks – common contact surfaces of the body – are most frequently affected.
21
, 
40


        Typically, the skin lesion initially appears as an asymptomatic, hyperkeratotic papule with an erythematous border, gradually developing into a reddish‐brown, verrucous plaque with a ring‐shaped or serpiginous growth pattern (Figure 4). Central atrophy or ulceration has also been reported.
41

(b) Plaques with whitish scales and hyperkeratosis, partially serpiginous, with pinpoint erosions on the dorsal digits and distal forearm. (c) Close‐up of the big toe showing a livid plaque with scaly to hyperkeratotic deposits and pinpoint erosions.
          
          
        
        The course of the disease is highly chronic, though spontaneous healing may still occur after several years.
        
Differential diagnoses: Infections with other mycobacteria, verrucae vulgares, chronic vegetative pyodermas, chromomycosis, tertiary syphilis, hypertrophic lichen planus, squamous cell carcinoma, and keratoacanthoma.
      
      
        Lupus vulgaris
        In Europe, lupus vulgaris is the most common form of cutaneous tuberculosis, accounting for 4%–63% of cases.
16
 The intact immune system of affected patients is already sensitized to tuberculosis. In most cases, lupus vulgaris results from hematogenous dissemination and, less frequently, lymphatic spread of an internal organ tuberculosis to the skin. It may also, though much less commonly, be triggered by contiguous spread from scrofuloderma or by vaccination. Lupus vulgaris is characterized by a single, slowly expanding reddish‐brown plaque that develops over several years, most commonly on the face, neck, or legs. It presents with a raised border and overlying scaly crusts, as well as central atrophy and scarring (Figure 5).
42
 A sporotrichoid pattern may occur in cases with multiple lesions.
43
 If the lesions appear on mucous membranes, they present as gray‐white or glassy. In non‐hyperkeratotic areas, diascopy may reveal an apple jelly‐like appearance. This sign is not specific to the disease and is rarely visible in skin of colour. It is important to note the increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in long‐standing, untreated lesions.
42


        
          FIGURE 5
          
            Lupus vulgaris most commonly affects the face. (a) Extensive involvement of the face with a well‐defined, erythematous‐livid plaque with a raised border. Notable features include madarosis and scattered erosions. (b) An erythematous plaque on the lower cheek, exhibiting slight scaling. (c) Erythematous, partially glistening, and partially scaly plaque on the nose.
          
          
        
        
Differential diagnoses: Tertiary syphilis, subcutaneous fungal infections, leishmaniasis, porokeratosis, actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease, sarcoidosis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and lichen planus.
      
      
        Tuberculosis mutilans
        In the advanced stage of lupus vulgaris, scarring and ulceration affect the skin, deeper connective tissue, and cartilage. The resulting contractures of the mouth, defects in the nasal or auricular cartilage with adhesions, or ectropion can lead to disfigurement (Figure 6). When the extremities are involved, this may result in movement restrictions and lymphatic obstruction.

        Tuberculids
        Tuberculids are a group of skin lesions that occur in the setting of active organ tuberculosis without anatomical proximity to the primary infection site. They occur in individuals with a well‐functioning immune system and are best understood as an immune reaction in the skin to the hematogenous dissemination of tubercle bacilli or their antigens.
44
 Initially, the reaction appears to be immune complex‐mediated, while in later stages, it seems to develop into granulomatous inflammatory responses.
        The pathogenesis of tuberculids remains a subject of debate. Notably, culture from the affected skin lesions is unsuccessful, whereas PCR is often positive. An active tuberculosis focus is frequently not identified, although interferon and tuberculin tests are usually strongly positive. While tuberculids resolve under antituberculous therapy, the anti‐inflammatory effects of antibiotics should also be considered.
18


        Currently, tuberculids include tuberculosis cutis lichenoides, papulonecrotic tuberculid, and erythema induratum of Bazin.
      
      
        Lichenoid cutaneous tuberculid (tuberculosis cutis lichenoides)
        In 72% of patients with a lichenoid tuberculid, systemic tuberculosis can be detected. Occurrence following BCG immunization has also been reported.
45
 Children and young adults are primarily affected, with a highly variable prevalence ranging from 0.1% of cutaneous tuberculosis cases in Japan to 33% in India.
22
, 
46


        The lichenoid cutaneous tuberculid is characterized by numerous asymptomatic perifollicular reddish to yellowish‐brown papules with variable scaling. These lesions appear in grouped formations, often along Langer's lines on the trunk (Figure 7). Healing occurs without scarring.
47
 Histologically, granulomas are found around hair follicles and sweat gland ducts without caseation.
        
          FIGURE 7

Differential diagnoses: Secondary syphilis, lichenoid exanthems, lichen nitidus, lichen planus, sarcoidosis, and keratosis pilaris.
      
      
        Papulonecrotic tuberculid
        Papulonecrotic tuberculid is seen mainly in children and young adults and accounts for 3% to 12.8% of cases of cutaneous tuberculosis.
22
, 
46


        It presents symmetrically with recurrent episodes of livid‐erythematous papules that evolve into pustular and necrotic lesions. The asymptomatic lesions appear in different stages simultaneously and primarily affect the extremities and trunk (Figure 8). Atrophic scars remain after healing.
36
 Histologically, a leukocytoclastic or granulomatous vasculitis is observed.
        
          FIGURE 8

Differential diagnoses: Small‐vessel vasculitides, lymphomatoid papulosis, and pityriasis lichenoides variants.
      
      
        Erythema induratum of Bazin
        Primarily affecting young women, erythema induratum of Bazin is more prevalent in Japan and China, accounting for 35%–40% of cutaneous tuberculosis cases.
46
 It is characterized by subcutaneous, livid‐erythematous nodules localized on both calves, which may undergo atrophy and ulceration, the latter of which is surprisingly painless (Figure 9).
48
 The frequently recurring lesions may heal within weeks to months, leaving behind atrophic hyperpigmentation and scars.
        
          FIGURE 9

        Histologically, erythema induratum of Bazin initially presents as predominantly lobular panniculitis with vasculitis. Over time, a tuberculoid granuloma may develop.
49
 The same clinical and histological presentation without a confirmed association with tuberculosis is referred to as nodular vasculitis.
50


        
Differential diagnoses: Erythema nodosum, lupus erythematosus profundus, perniosis, other vasculitides, pyoderma gangrenosum, and sarcoidosis.
      
    
    
      CONCLUSIONS
      Recognition of cutaneous tuberculosis as a potential differential diagnosis is crucial for timely identification, isolation of multibacillary forms, and interruption of possible chains of infection. The often delayed diagnosis and treatment – due to its similarity to other dermatoses – may lead to scarring and increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma in lupus vulgaris, with malignant transformation occurring in 10% of long‐standing lesions.
      Cutaneous manifestations of tuberculosis may be indicative of systemic tuberculosis, therefore prompt recognition followed by the start of an appropriate treatment regime reduces the risk of patient morbidity and mortality.
      In cases of inadequate response to previous therapies and appropriate clinical presentation, cutaneous tuberculosis should still be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in immunosuppressed patients or those with a history of travel to high‐risk countries.

      Introduction
      Photothermal therapy (PTT) has emerged as a promising treatment modality for a wide range of dermatological conditions, including acne vulgaris, a prevalent and often distressing skin disorder [1]. Acne affects millions of individuals worldwide. It manifests through inflammatory lesions, comedones, and, in severe cases, cystic nodules, leading to significant physical and psychological impacts. The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial, involving overproduction of sebum, hyperkeratinization, inflammation, and proliferation of Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes), a bacterium that thrives in an anaerobic environment of clogged hair follicles.
      Traditional acne therapies including topical retinoids, antibiotics, and oral isotretinoin have provided substantial benefits. However, they have limitations such as antibiotic resistance, side effects, and patient compliance issues. In this context, photothermal therapy using gold nanoparticles, which utilizes light to generate localized heat capable of targeting specific tissues or microorganisms, offers a novel approach to treating acne by directly impacting C. acnes and sebaceous glands while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues.
      Recent advances in nanotechnology and laser technology have further enhanced the efficacy of photothermal therapy in dermatology. By employing nanoparticles that can absorb light at specific wavelengths, photothermal therapy can be precisely targeted, destroying C. acnes bacteria and reducing sebaceous gland activity. This precision can reduce inflammatory responses and promote faster healing with fewer side effects, making PTT a compelling alternative or adjunct to conventional acne treatments.
      Ethosomes are advanced lipid vesicles showing significant potential for transdermal drug delivery [2]. Their unique compositions, such as phospholipids, ethanol, and water, allow them to enhance the permeability of the skin barrier, enabling efficient delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients through the skin. In this study, ethosomes were used to deliver gold nanoparticles. Methods such as sonophoresis and CO2 fractional laser can be used later to enhance skin penetration of ethosome gold nanoparticles. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of gold photothermal therapy after CO2 fractional laser pretreatment for acne.

        2.1
        Patients
        Twenty‐four patients with moderate to severe acne who visited the Department of Dermatology, Korea University Ansan Hospital and Arumdaun Nara Dermatologic Clinic between June 2022 and February 2023 participated in this study. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Korea University Ansan Hospital (IRB no. 2022AS0124). Before undergoing the procedure, all participants were thoroughly informed about the potential benefits and risks associated with the treatment, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient.
      
      
        2.2
        Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
        Patients with a history of keloids, active skin infections, or uncontrolled systemic diseases were excluded from this study. Individuals who had received oral antibiotic treatments within the past 3 months, oral retinoid therapy within the past 6 months, or other laser treatments within the past 3 months were also excluded. Pregnant or lactating individuals were also excluded from this study.
      
      
        2.3
        Treatment Protocol
        Patients applied a local anesthetic cream (a eutectic mixture of 2.5% lidocaine HCl and 2.5% prilocaine; Taiguk Pharm Co. Ltd., Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea) to their faces for 40 min prior to the procedure. Each patient received three consecutive treatments spaced 2–3 weeks apart. They were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 patients received CO2 fractional laser treatment followed by the application of an ethosome gold nanoparticle ampoule (ETHOSOME PTT, N‐FINDERS, Seoul, Republic of Korea), while Group 2 only applied the ethosome gold nanoparticle ampoule using sonophoresis. After ampoule application, all patients underwent a long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser treatment (V Laser wavelength, 1064 nm; fluence, 5.0 J/cm2; frequency, 10 Hz; pulse duration, 0.3 ms; and spot size, 10 mm with cooling off) in a sweeping technique. Ethosome gold nanoparticle ampoules contain gold and platinum nanoparticles, each sized between 50 nm and 100 nm with a spherical shape. During a single treatment, 2 mL of the ampoule was applied to the entire face. Group 1 received CO2 fractional laser treatment (U‐pulse, SNJ, Seoul, Korea) with 5 mJ, Density 1.0 mm (distance between dots), and 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 sized square scan. Group 2 received sonophoresis (Bellasonic 2X, LTRA Global, Gyeonggi‐do, Korea) 3/10 MHz, Intensity 5 for 10 min for solution penetration.
      
      
        2.4
        Clinical Assessment
        All evaluations were conducted by two independent dermatologists who were not involved in this study. Clinical photographs were taken at baseline, before each treatment session, and 2 weeks after the final treatment. These photographs were captured using a digital camera (EOS 80D; Canon KK, Tokyo, Japan) with patients positioned consistently under uniform lighting conditions. Changes in the number of papules, pustules, and comedones were recorded both before and after treatment.
        Before each subsequent treatment, patients were asked about any adverse effects they had experienced since the previous session. At the final visit, two blinded dermatologists performed overall assessments for each patient using the following scoring scales to evaluate general improvement:
No improvement1%–24% improvement25%–49% improvement50%–74% improvement75%–100% improvement

        Also, a patient survey was conducted on their improvement.
      
      
        2.5
        Histopathological and Blood Examination
        Punch biopsies were obtained from acne lesions before and after treatment in one patient who consented. These specimens were then subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. To investigate the systemic absorption of gold nanoparticles, blood tests were conducted 2 weeks after the final treatment for four patients who had provided consent. It was sent to the Korea Institute of Science and Technology for ICP‐MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry).
      
      
        2.6
        In Vitro Test of Acrylic Plate
        Ethosome was applied manually onto an acrylic plate. A long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser was then used for irradiation (Figure 1, left side). CO2 fractional laser was used for irradiation before ethosome treatment. A long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser was then used for irradiation (Figure 1, right side). After CO2 fractional laser treatment, ethosome was absorbed much better on the right side than on the left side. Therefore, the reaction was greater after treatment with a long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser on the right side.

        2.7
        Statistical Analysis
        All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25 software. Changes in the number of lesions, including papules, pustules, and comedones, between baseline and the final treatment were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test. Additionally, a subgroup analysis was performed to compare Group 1 and Group 2 using both paired t‐test and the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

      Discussion
      Acne can be treated using various methods. Recently, alternative treatments have been developed for patients unable to take medications. Among these treatments, selective targeting of sebaceous glands and Cutibacterium acnes has gained attention [3]. One such treatment involves a 1726 nm laser that can be highly absorbed by sebaceous glands [4]. Another promising approach is gold photothermal therapy (PTT), which uses gold nanoparticles absorbed into the skin followed by laser irradiation at wavelengths that these particles can absorb well [5].
      Gold PTT has been extensively used in cancer therapy [6]. In 2015, Pithankar et al. [1] introduced its application in acne treatment by inducing photothermolysis of sebaceous follicles after absorbing gold microparticles into the skin. Since then, multiple studies have explored gold PTT for acne treatment [5, 7]. However, effective absorption of gold nanoparticles into the skin has been a significant challenge. Research has shown that ultrasound can improve absorption rates compared to simple topical applications or mechanical methods [8]. Using porcine skin, Lee et al. [9] have demonstrated that a combination of thulium laser and sonophoresis can enhance gold nanoparticle delivery, with subsequent long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser irradiation achieving over 50% destruction of sebaceous follicles by comparing the effects of three methods (sonophoresis alone, thulium laser followed by sonophoresis, and thulium laser followed by manual massage). The most significant sebaceous gland destruction occurred in the group treated with a thulium laser followed by sonophoresis.
      Building on this, we used CO2 fractional lasers as an alternative to thulium lasers for pretreatment to facilitate nanoparticle absorption. In an in vitro experiment using acrylic plates, pretreatment with CO2 fractional lasers followed by long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser irradiation amplified therapeutic responses. Several techniques, including sonophoresis [10] and iontophoresis [11], have been tested to improve gold nanoparticle absorption. We used CO2 fractional laser pretreatment to enhance nanoparticle penetration before applying gold PTT. Sonophoresis is expected to enhance the follicular penetration of gold nanoparticles, whereas CO2 fractional laser pretreatment is expected to cause less selective penetration of gold nanoparticles, leading to diffuse dermis heating. This less selectivity may be related to improving diverse acne lesions with CO2 fractional laser pretreatment. Further studies are needed with a large number of patients to prove this.
      Considering a potential risk of excessive gold absorption, blood gold levels in a few volunteers were measured. Early concerns about systemic absorption of gold nanoparticles emerged during the introduction of gold PTT. Although a review of over 20 studies found no major side effects, it noted the presence of gold in tumor tissues and the liver for up to 174 days [12]. However, these studies were focused on cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and relapsing multiple sclerosis, with only one skin‐related research study available. Moreover, differences in the amount of gold nanoparticles used for acne treatment versus cancer therapy remained unclear as reviewed studies did not specify dosages.
      Despite initial concerns, Pithankar et al. [1] and others have reported no evidence of systemic absorption. Although intact skin minimally absorbs nanoparticles, CO2 fractional laser pretreatment can increase absorption. While this raised concerns about systemic side effects, in vitro tests using acrylic plates confirmed that gold nanoparticle absorption was significantly enhanced following CO2 fractional laser pretreatment, amplifying the response to long‐pulsed Nd:YAG lasers. Blood tests in volunteers showed no increase in systemic gold level, alleviating safety concerns.
      A recent study elucidated how gold‐based PTT can aid acne treatment [13]. It found that PTT could damage the mitochondrial respiratory chain in sebaceous glands, triggering ferroptosis in sebaceous cells and tissues.
      Our clinical trial showed that both sonophoresis and CO2 fractional laser methods significantly reduced papules and pustules. However, only those in the CO2 fractional laser group achieved a statistically significant reduction in comedones. This suggests that CO2 fractional laser pretreatment is more effective across a broader range of acne lesions. Additionally, fractional laser treatment likely contributed to secondary improvements of acne scars. Although pretreatment was intended to reduce procedure time by maximizing absorption, the time spent in wrapping treated areas for occlusion negated these savings. This study is limited by the fact that only one patient's biopsy was used to discuss the histological improvement. Further studies are needed to prove the effects of combining CO2 fractional laser and gold‐based PTT on more patients.

      Conclusions
      Ethosome gold photothermal therapy demonstrated significant clinical and histological improvements in acne vulgaris among Asian patients, showing no serious adverse effects or systemic absorption of gold nanoparticles. Patients treated with CO2 fractional laser pretreatment before ampule application showed reductions across all acne lesion types, including comedones, and experienced improvement in acne scars.

Title: Enhancing Skin Rejuvenation: Using of Engineered Exosome Content Treated With Oleuropein and Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein

Abstract: ABSTRACTBackgroundSkin aging, which is affected by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, leads to reduced elastin, collagen, and hydration levels.AimsThis study aimed to utilize modified exosomal content with treated Oleuropein and Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein to modulate gene and microRNA expression on the HFFF2 cells in vitro in order to reduce skin aging.Material & MethodsFe3O4@C/Oleuropein was synthesized using the hydrothermal method and confirmed by XRD, FTIR, and SEM. The MTT assay was conducted to test toxicity Following this, hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were treated with Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein and Oleuropein. Exosomes derived from the treatments were extracted by ultracentrifugation and evaluated by DLS and western blotting. HFFF2 cells were treated with exosomes derived from the treatments. The expression of the studied genes and related microRNAs was measured using qRT‐PCR. Also, the effect of exosomes derived from the treatments on HFFF2 cells was evaluated using flow cytometry.ResultsThe results showed that the expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes was significantly increased with Oleuropein (500 μg/mL) and Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein (250 μg/mL) treatments, especially when treated with exosomes derived from treatments. Moreover, the expression of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs was significantly downregulated, and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated in the HFFF2 cells, which was consistent with the exosome cargo derived from treated cells.ConclusionsExosomes can increase gene expression and reduce microRNAs associated with skin antiaging. Using modified exosomal content treated with Oleuropein and Fe3O4@CQD/Oleuropein is generally effective for preventing skin aging and also presents innovative methods for skin care.

      Introduction
      Currently, there is growing attention to skin rejuvenation because of the increase in people's life expectancy [1]. Skin aging is a complicated process that includes intrinsic (chronological) aging and extrinsic aging (e.g., sun, gravity, sleeping positions, and smoking). In both types of aging, there is a decrease in elastin, collagen, and loss in hydration leading to dryness and atrophy, with fine wrinkling in the skin [2, 3]. Fibroblasts, the predominant population responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, are the primary cause of skin senescence [4, 5].
      So far, researchers have extensively studied skin rejuvenation and proposed strategies for reducing skin aging, one of which is nanotechnology. Recent research shows that Fe3O4@CQDs significantly reduce ROS and inhibit pro‐inflammatory cytokines like TNF‐α and IL‐1β, addressing oxidative damage and aging pathways [6, 7]. Studies indicate that nanotechnology enhances cosmetic effectiveness by increasing capture efficiency, controlling drug release, improving physical stability, increasing moisturization, and enhancing ultraviolet (UV) protection [8].
      As more people become interested in natural cosmetics, Oleuropein, a phenolic substance found in olive leaves (
Olea europaea
), has been shown to have multiple skin advantages in clinical studies [9, 10, 11]. This secoiridoid has a special ability to change how different mechanisms of skin aging interact, such as oxidative stress, inflammasome activation, and the degeneration of the ECM [12, 13]. Studies show that it is able to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower the levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines including IL‐1β and IL‐6, and boost collagen production through pathways that are mediated by VEGF [14, 15]. Oleuropein increases collagen synthesis and inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade skin collagen and elastin [10, 11].
      Also, studies have shown that vitamin C is one of the compounds that affects skin rejuvenation. Vitamin C neutralizes free radicals and increases collagen, but Oleuropein does better in the role of removing ROS [16] while also inhibiting IL‐1β and caspase‐1‐mediated inflammasome activation, which is associated with both oxidative stress and inflammation [16]. Oleuropein is stable in formulations, unlike vitamin C, which degrades quickly [17]. Based on research, Retinol enhances skin texture but induces inflammation and necessitates the avoidance of UV exposure, whereas Fe3O4@CQDs decrease inflammation without impairing barrier function, and their magnetic targeting minimizes systemic exposure [18, 19]. In contrast to hyaluronic acid or niacinamide, which disperse widely, Fe3O4@CQDs improve spatial accuracy by concentrating active ingredients in photoaged or inflammatory regions [8, 20, 21].
      Another strategy for decreasing skin aging is exosomes, which have recently attracted significant attention as a therapy for skin rejuvenation [22]. Exosomes, a category of skincare agents, are increasing in popularity in the cosmetics industry because of their therapeutic and rejuvenating characteristics. They contain proteins, lipids, nucleic acids like microRNAs, and other compounds, which promote healing, hydration, and skin health. Exosomes can be modified by manipulating the culture medium or cell content and can repair skin damage such as sunburn and acne scars. They also contain bioactive compounds that protect the skin from environmental influences and minimize dark spots [23, 24, 25, 26]. On the other hand, microRNAs are one of the most major molecules present in exosomes [27]. MicroRNAs have been shown to have various activities in skin aging after differentially expressed microRNAs were identified based on the results of microRNA sequence analysis [28].
      Recent clinical trials and research have shown that both unmodified and modified (engineered) exosomes, particularly those sourced from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and fibroblasts, are efficacious in skin rejuvenation, wound healing, and enhancement of barrier function [29, 30, 31]. Also, exosome‐based creams represent an innovative method in cosmetic dermatology, proving efficacy in skin rejuvenation, hydration, pigmentation correction, and wound healing [31, 32].
      Research findings suggest that multiple signaling pathways play a role in the process of skin aging. Insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a key protein that stimulates keratinocyte growth [4]. Many downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and MAPK, are phosphorylated as a result of IGF1 activation of the insulin‐like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) [33]. IGF1 activates the PI3PK/AKT pathway, prevents dermal fibroblasts from UV‐B‐induced programmed cell death, and promotes cell survival via the MAPK pathway [34]. Also, epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a mitogenic polypeptide. It can activate and multiply myofibroblasts through the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways [35, 36]. EGF has a bright future in cosmetic antiaging applications because it plays an important role in upregulating fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in the skin [37].
      The present study aimed to utilize modified exosomal content with treated Oleuropein and Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein to modulate the expression of genes (IGF1, IGF1R, EGF, COL1A1, and ELN) and microRNAs (hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, hsa‐let‐7e‐5p, and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p) related to IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K pathways on the HFFF2 cells (in vitro) in order to reduce the aging process in the skin.

Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein Synthesis
        Fe3O4 (Cas No 1309‐37‐1; US Research Nanomaterials Inc., USA) nanoparticles (1 g) and d‐glucose (0.5 g: a compound of carbon origin) were suspended in 60 mL of distilled water, and the suspension was sonicated for 30 min. Subsequently, using the hydrothermal method, the suspension was incubated at 180°C for 5 h to synthesize Fe3O4@CQD in the Hydrothermal Autoclave. Thereafter, the synthesized Fe3O4@CQD was separated by centrifugation at 2000 g for min. After washing with water and ethanol, the samples were dried using a freeze dryer. In the following, 1 g of dried Fe3O4@CQD and 0.1 g of Oleuropein (32619‐42‐4; Sigma‐Aldrich, Germany) were suspended in 50 mL of distilled water and stirred by a shaker for 24 h to make Fe3O4@CQD/Oleuropein. Finally, the Fe@C/Ole NPs were gathered, washed, and dried using a freeze dryer.

The plates were incubated for 24 and 48 h. Next, the medium was removed, and MTT (2‐(4,5‐dimethythiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added. After incubation for 4 h, the contents of the wells were removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the wells (the assay was repeated three times). The IC50 and IC25 were calculated by measuring the absorbance of the formazan crystals at a wavelength of 570 nm (Awareness Microwell Plate Reader Chromate 4300, USA).

        Physicochemical Properties of Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein
        The FT‐IR spectra of Fe3O4, Ole, Fe3O4@CQD, and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole are shown in Figure 1. The functional groups of the synthesized nanoparticles were identified. The strong band at 3350–3500 cm−1 confirmed the O‐H stretching bond of the phenolic part of Ole and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole. The peaks at approximately 500–600 cm−1 correspond to Fe‐O bonding, confirming the presence of Fe3O4 in the structures of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CQD, and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole. Fe3O4@CQD and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole exhibited a C=O stretching band at 1710 cm−1, signifying the presence of Fe3O4‐CQD. C–H stretching vibration signals were observed at 2920 cm−1. The characteristic vibration of the carbonyl groups in the Ole molecule was responsible for the signals observed at 1720 cm−1. The signal appeared at 1597 cm−1 as a stretching vibration and 1386 cm−1 as a bending vibration belonging to the functional groups C = C and O‐H, respectively. These results indicated the presence of Ole in Fe3O4@CQD/Ole (Figure 1A). The XRD pattern of Oleuropein attached to magnetite nanoparticles. All the signals in this pattern match the information from the standard XRD pattern of magnetite nanoparticles and confirm the crystallinity of the nanoparticles (Figure 1B). Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a spherical spinel structure showed signals at (311), (220), (440), (511), (422), and (400). The absence of (110) (2θ = 21.220) and (104) (2θ = 33.150) signals indicates that neither goethite (α‐FeOOH) nor hematite (α‐Fe2O3) phases were formed in the samples. Additionally, the binding of Oleuropein does not change the structure of Fe3O4@CQD; a broad peak is observed between 2θ = 12–28, which pertains to the overlap between Oleuropein and Fe3O4@CQD (Figure 1B). The morphology and size of the nanoparticles were determined using field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FE‐SEM) technique. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the sample revealed a range of particle sizes, ranging from 30 to 80 nm. Therefore, the image illustrates that the particles of the sample ingredients exhibited a high degree of homogeneity and possessed a consistent, symmetrical, and uniform distribution (Figure 1C).

        Viability Percentage (MTT Assay)
        Fe@C/Ole was evaluated as a conductive particle in terms of cell viability (Figure 3A), and the IC50 for the HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs was 484.52 and 511 μg/mL, respectively. Cell treatment was performed using IC25 ≃ 250 μg/mL, although cell growth inhibition was also observed in this treatment.

        The effects of different concentrations of Ole on the viability of HFFF2 and hUC‐MSCs were studied (Figure 3B). The amount of the IC50 was estimated at 1035.4 μg/mL for the HFFF2 cells and 977.43 μg/mL for hUC‐MSCs; cell treatment was performed utilizing IC25 ≃ 500 μg/mL for cell treatment as an effective concentration. In summary, the results showed that Ole has cell inhibition and toxicity in very high concentrations (IC50 ≃ 1000 μg/mL), whereas Fe@C/Ole has them in low concentrations (IC25 ≃ 500 μg/mL).

          Western Blot Analysis
          In the western blot image, protein bands with a size of 26 kDa indicated exosome membrane protein CD63 (Figure 4A,B). The protein CD63 was present in the Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups in both the hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells. Furthermore, the presence of protein bands at 24 kDa implies the existence of the exosome membrane protein CD9, as depicted in Figure 4C,D. We detected CD9 protein in the hUC‐MSCs, HFFF2 cells, and control group.

          The Relative Gene Expression Treated With Fe@C/Ole and Ole
          In the ANOVA test, significant differences were observed between the treatments (Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control) in the HFFF2 cells, in terms of the relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes (p ≤ 0.05). Also, in the hUC‐MSCs, there was a significant difference in the relative expression (p ≤ 0.05) of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A, and ELN genes between the treatments. In contrast to other genes, no significant difference was observed in the relative gene expression of EGF in the hUC‐MSCs between the treatments (Table S3).
          The HFFF2 cells exhibited significant upregulation in the expression of the IGF1 (fold change: 3.14), IGF1R (5.3), COL1A1 (2.11), ELN (3.17), and EGF (3.5) genes in response to Ole treatment compared to the control group. Additionally, Fe@C/Ole treatment upregulated the expression of the IGF1R (2.03), ELN (1.94), and EGF (2.76) genes compared with the control group; however, there were no significant changes in the IGF1 and COL1A1 genes in the Fe@C/Ole group compared with the control group (Figure 5A). This trend of gene expression changes was similar in hUC‐MSCs, although, as mentioned, the EGF gene was not significant, and, unlike the HFFF2 cells, the COL1A1 gene was upregulated in the Fe@C/Ole treatment (Figure 5B).

          The Relative Gene Expression in Exosome‐Treated HFFF2 Cells
          According to the qRT‐PCR data and analysis of variance, there was a significant difference between HFFF2‐derived exosomes and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control treatments in terms of the relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes (p ≤ 0.05) in HFFF2 cells (Table S4).
          The findings indicated that the relative expression levels of IGF1 (2.6, 6.14), IGF1R (3.02, 6.11), COL1A1(3.73, 4.25), ELN (2.5, 3.25), and EGF (4.06, 4.14) were strongly upregulated in the HFFF2 cells treated with HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes with Ole compared to the control group, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Also, the results showed that the relative expression levels of IGF1 (3.4, 5.62), IGF1R (3.9, 6.02), COL1A1 (2.24, 3.32), ELN (2.4, 3.4), and EGF (3.61, 4.12) were significantly upregulated in the HFFF2 cells after the treatment of HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes with Fe@C/Ole compared to the control group, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Overall, the effects of HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes were similar; however, the effect of exosome treatment on gene expression was more significant than that of direct treatment with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to the control group.

          In the ANOVA, significant differences were observed between the treatments (Table S5). The results showed that hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs were significantly downregulated, whereas miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated in HFFF2‐derived exosome content, as well as in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosome content treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to the control (Figure 7A,B).

          The Relative Expression of microRNAs in HFFF 2 Cells Treated With Cell‐Derived Exosomes
          In the ANOVA test, significant changes were observed between the treatments (Table S6). The present study evaluated the amounts of different microRNAs in HFFF2 cells treated with HFFF2‐derived exosomes and in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes in comparison to the control. The results indicated that the hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs were downregulated in HFFF2 cells between the treatments. In contrast, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated between treatments in HFFF2 cells (Figure 8A,B).

          Expression Correlation of microRNAs

          Our investigation demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the expression levels of specific microRNAs in modified exosomal content and the associated alterations in HFFF2 cells treated with these exosomes. This finding supports the concept that exosomal miRNAs are conveyed to recipient cells and influence their gene expression.
          The study examined expression correlation of several microRNAs, including hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p, in HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to exosomes of HFFF2 cells that were treated with exosomes derived from these cells. Significant positive correlations were consistently observed for these microRNAs in exosomes and exosomes of HFFF2 cells, indicating a robust influence on HFFF2 cellular responses. These results highlight the critical role of exosomes in intercellular communication and the regulation of gene expression within recipient cells (Table S7).

        Results of Exosome Toxicity Investigation
        The Flow Cytometry analysis results showed no significant variations in the viability percentage between HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, or the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 9). Flow Cytometry analysis of cell death data, including late apoptosis and necrosis, revealed no significant differences between exosome treatments. However, the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole significantly increased early apoptosis (p ≤ 0.05); on the other hand, there were no significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in early apoptosis between the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Ole and the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 9).

      Discussion
      Previous research has revealed that the IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways are involved in skin rejuvenation [34, 35, 36, 37]. For these signaling pathways, we selected to investigate growth factors and their receptors, including the IGF1, IGF1R, and EGF genes, as well as the COL1A1 and ELN genes, which are primarily involved in skin renewal. Conversely, microRNAs modulate gene expression in the skin aging process. Research has identified multiple microRNAs linked to skin aging, which also target our chosen genes, notably the hsa‐miR‐29, hsa‐miR‐34, and hsa‐let‐7 families [49]. Research has shown that IGF1 is regulated by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [39] and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [40]; IGF1R is targeted by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [41], hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [42], hsa‐let‐7d‐5p [43], and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p [43]; EGF is regulated by hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [44]; COL1A1 is targeted by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [45], hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [46], and hsa‐let‐7d‐5p [47]; and ELN is regulated by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [48].
      Aging causes an increase in MMPs and a reduction in Collagen (COL1A1) and Elastin (ELN) levels [50, 51]. Thus, enhancing the production of Collagen (COL1A1) and Elastin (ELN) can effectively mitigate the effects of aging and promote rejuvenation [51, 52]. This study revealed that Ole and Fe@C/Ole (slow release) treatments increased COL1A1 and ELN mRNA levels in HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs that support the hypothesis of skin rejuvenation through treatments, as MMP9 (nonreported) has the ability to degrade collagen and elastin. Results were anticipated given the proven efficacy of Ole in many signaling pathways, including IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K [13, 53]. The effect of Ole can be attributed to its antioxidant effects, as well as its influence on the expression of growth factors such as IGF1 and EGF [10, 54, 55]. Generally, in our study, Ole treatment upregulated the expression of IGF1, EGF, and IGF1R, but IGF1 was not significant in Fe@C/Ole treatment (Figures 5 and 6). To date, reports have shown that antioxidant treatments, such as Ole, quercetin, and resveratrol, increase the expression of IGF1, EGF, and IGF1R genes [56, 57].
      The nanocomposite structure can improve Ole's stability and activity by preventing degradation in biological fluids. This is crucial for maintaining therapeutic levels during treatment [58]. Ole's effect on enhancing these growth factors and their receptors has been examined by targeting the MAPK signaling pathway [53, 59], which supports the rejuvenation process by inhibiting MMPs and promoting the production of COL1A1 and ELN (Figure 11). Furthermore, previous studies have highlighted Ole's ability to activate the PI3K signaling pathway and its significant antioxidant effects [60]. This pathway is known for its antioxidant properties; by increasing the expression of antioxidant cascades within the cell's nucleus and mitochondria, it actively inhibits the aging process [61]. Additionally, reducing MMP activity and blocking inflammatory pathways—such as those involving prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), nitric oxide (NO), and interleukin 6 (IL‐6)—promotes the synthesis of collagen (COL1) and elastin (ELN) (Figure 11).

      In fact, our investigation involved treating HFFF2 cells with exosomes derived from both HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs, all of which had been pre‐treated with either Ole or Fe@C/Ole. This approach led to an observable increase in the expression of several key genes: IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF (Figure 11). This outcome aligns generally with findings from direct Ole therapy, with the notable exception of the EGF gene's response in hUC‐MSCs. Interestingly, whereas direct treatment of HFFF2 cells with Fe@C/Ole did not significantly alter the expression of IGF1 and COL1A1 and similarly for EGF and IGF1 in hUC‐MSCs, a significant upregulation was observed when these cells were instead treated with exosomes originating from HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs that had undergone Fe@C/Ole pre‐treatment. This suggests that the reduced toxicity of Fe@C/Ole when delivered via exosomes appears to have notably increased gene expression within the exosomes themselves, a significant improvement compared to direct application. Utilizing modified exosomal content offers distinct benefits over conventional treatments. Primarily, these modified exosomes do not trigger the body's antibody and antigen systems, thus avoiding an immune response. Secondly, their internal components are directly influenced by the initial treatment, as these exosomes are typically derived from living cells [22, 62]. Furthermore, both Ole therapy and Fe@C/Ole application substantially altered the makeup of the exosomes, leading to observable changes in their modified content. Exosomes also exhibit remarkable anti‐inflammatory properties, which contribute to accelerated healing, a reduced risk of EGF complications such as post‐inflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring, and improved results in photo rejuvenation by enhancing collagenases and promoting the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts [63, 64].
      On the other hand, this investigation focused on microRNAs linked to genes involved in the IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways. We assessed how Ole and Fe@C/Ole treatments affected the levels of exosomal microRNAs in HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs, given their known association with growth factors and genes critical for skin rejuvenation. The findings indicated that a 24‐h treatment influenced the expression levels of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs in exosomes. The changes in Ole and Fe@C/Ole treatments resulted in the downregulation of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs in exosomes derived from HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs. Downregulation of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs as interfering RNAs justified the upregulation of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF gene expression (Table 2). These observations were corroborated by the expression of the aforementioned genes within HFFF2 cells, subsequent to their treatment with HFFF2‐derived exosomes that had undergone pre‐treatment with Ole and Fe@C/Ole (Figure 6). This research demonstrates a clear alignment between the microRNA levels found within the exosomes and those present in the HFFF2 recipient cells influenced by these exosomes. Consequently, modified exosomal content, produced through Ole and Fe@C/Ole therapy, emerges as a practical substitute for directly treating cells. These tiny vesicles hold considerable benefits when compared to traditional topical facial applications, positioning them as a more effective therapeutic choice [65, 66].
      Unexpectedly, overexpression of hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p in exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole and also exosomes of HFFF2 cells that were treated with exosomes derived from these cells indicates a complex role in skin aging responses. It enhances skin repair by promoting cell turnover and healthier epidermal layers, regulates oncogene‐suppressing pathways to prevent skin deterioration, and induces apoptosis to clear damaged cells, supporting new cell generation. Additionally, it modulates genes vital for tissue repair, boosting collagen and elastin synthesis for improved skin youthfulness. These effects collectively enhance skin self‐renewal, underscoring its potential in antiaging research [67, 68, 69, 70].
      This study provides novel insights into the regenerative properties of modified exosomal contents, indicating that Ole and Fe@C/Ole in exosome‐based therapies hold great promise for skin rejuvenation. In addition, this study offers important insights into the effects of Ole and Fe@C/Ole on cellular mechanisms, and it is important to understand that the experiments were performed in vitro using cell lines. Applying these findings to in vivo conditions, such as human skin, could require more studies. The intricacies of the human body, including factors such as skin thickness and blood circulation, may affect the efficacy and potential side effects of Ole or Fe@C/Ole‐based treatments.

      Conclusion
      The research findings indicate that the use of modified exosomal content with Ole and Fe@C/Ole (slow release) treatment is a more effective method for transferring substances and biomolecules that are effective in the molecular mechanisms of skin rejuvenation than the use of effective substance treatment alone in vitro. This method can ultimately increase collagen and elastin gene expression while reducing interfering microRNAs in their respective genes.

Title: Dysprosium, cerium, indium, yttrium, and lutetium as emerging contributors to oxidative stress in polycystic ovary syndrome

Abstract: To investigate the role of Dysprosium (Dy), Cerium (Ce), Indium (In), Yttrium (Y), and Lutetium (Lu) in relation to oxidative stress (OS) and their potential alterations in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) females. This case-control study included two groups: Healthy controls (50) and PCOS cases (56). Serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu were quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). OS was evaluated by measuring serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation was performed to investigate the correlation between rare earth elements (REEs) and OS markers and differences in correlation strength between the PCOS and control groups were assessed using Fisher’s z-test. PCOS subjects exhibited markedly higher concentrations of Dy, Ce, In, and Y than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The analysis of OS biomarkers revealed elevated MDA levels in the PCOS group, indicating enhanced lipid peroxidation, alongside significantly reduced antioxidant capacity (GSH and SOD) (P < 0.001). Pearson’s correlation demonstrated significant positive associations between higher Dy, Ce, and Y levels and increased MDA levels (P < 0.05). Additionally, a significant negative correlation was observed between In and Y and the antioxidant markers GSH and SOD (P < 0.05), with Ce also showing an inverse association with SOD (P < 0.05). Fisher’s z-test further confirmed significant differences in correlation strength between the PCOS and control groups for Dy-MDA (z = 2.01, P = 0.031), Ce-MDA (z = 1.78, P = 0.037), In-GSH (z = − 2.24, P = 0.025), and In-SOD (z = − 2.39, P = 0.017). Moreover, significant correlations were found between Dy and Y (r = 0.41, P = 0.003), Ce and In (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), Ce and Y (r = 0.53, P < 0.001), and In and Y (r = 0.70, P < 0.001), suggesting interconnected roles of Dy, Ce, In, and Y in PCOS. These findings point to a potential link between OS and REE exposure in the development of PCOS. They suggest that metal-induced oxidative damage could be a key contributor to its pathophysiology. The study underscores the need for deeper investigation into environmental factors affecting reproductive health and for identifying strategies to mitigate these risks in women with PCOS.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-10468-2.

Body: Introduction
      With the surge in technological and industrial progress, women’s health faces unprecedented challenges. The extensive use of metallic compounds in agriculture and domestic spheres has intensified exposure to various elements, raising significant concerns about their impact, especially on reproductive health. Rare earth elements (REEs), often known as ‘technology elements,’ are vital to the advancement of numerous high-tech fields, including consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones and computers) and sustainable energy technologies1–3. Although their distinctive chemical characteristics render them critical for such applications, growing environmental accumulation of REEs has raised concerns regarding their potential effects on human health, particularly in relation to reproductive disorders like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Environmentally, growing extraction, use, and disposal of these elements have led to their accumulation, with human activities contributing to their buildup in soil and water systems4–7. Human exposure to REEs is elevated due to their high mobility and ion-emitting properties, which allow them to easily enter ecosystems, accumulate in the food chain, and increase environmental exposure. As “emerging pollutants,” these elements remain largely unregulated, with limited monitoring and insufficient understanding of their toxic effects. Concerns about the health impacts of REEs are growing, particularly regarding their effects on reproductive health, including fertility and pregnancy outcomes8–11. Although studies on its reproductive toxicity are limited, evidence from animal models indicates that elevated doses may disrupt ovarian function and lead to embryotoxic effects. The adverse effects of REEs on reproductive function have been investigated in sea urchins, where exposure was shown to impair fertilization, disrupt redox balance, interfere with embryonic development, and alter the regulation of genes involved in embryogenesis12. Notably, some human studies have documented an increased risk of preeclampsia, neural tube defects, adverse IVF outcomes, spontaneous abortion, and premature membrane rupture with higher maternal REE levels13–16. More recently, an increased risk of pregnancy loss has been reported in women with miscarriage owing to increase in serum REE9–11. Metals like Dysprosium (Dy), Cerium (Ce), Indium (In), and yttrium (Y) and Lutetium (Lu), may pose a significant risk to reproductive health, due to their widespread use in modern technologies and potential toxicity1,17–19. A recent case–control study reported higher heavy metals in women with PCOS compared to controls, linking these alterations to metabolic dysfunction and environmental exposures19.
      PCOS is a complex endocrine disorder and a major cause of infertility in women globally17. The condition presents with irregular ovulation, excess androgens, and polycystic ovaries, though its underlying causes remain poorly understood20–22. While the etiology of PCOS is multifactorial, recent evidence suggests that environmental factors, including exposure to heavy metals and REEs, may contribute to its development23–25, however, underlying etiologies remain unclear. Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu are REEs that may have potential impacts on reproductive health. Presumably, they could induce oxidative stress (OS), and alter redox balance, potentially exacerbating conditions associated with PCOS13,26–28. Increased levels of these REEs can interfere with hormonal balance, affect ovarian function, and impair fertility. Oxidative damage resulting from REE exposure may alter reproductive processes like oocyte maturation and impair follicle development in the case of PCOS. While the full extent of their impact on human reproductive health remains under investigation, emerging research suggests that exposure to these REEs may contribute to reproductive toxicity and conditions such as infertility and PCOS. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to examine serum levels of selected rare earth elements - Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu in patients with PCOS. It seeks to explore the correlation between these elements and markers of OS, comparing PCOS patients with fertile controls. The reprotoxic effects of these five REEs are scarcely documented in pregnancy-related research involving humans, making them the subject of our study. By shedding light on these relationships, this research aims to provide new insights into how REEs may contribute to the development and progression of PCOS. The findings could have far-reaching implications for developing diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies, offering a deeper understanding of how environmental pollutants influence reproductive health and paving the way for targeted interventions. The study thus aims to estimate the serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu in women with PCOS and to assess the correlation between these REE levels and oxidative stress markers in PCOS patients compared to fertile controls.
    
    
      Result
      
        Participant characteristics
        This study revealed notable differences between women with PCOS and controls across clinical, and biochemical parameters. Among the participants, 52.8% were women with PCOS, while 47.1% served as controls. Sociodemographic characteristics showed no statistically significant variation across the study groups, as demonstrated by data from our prior study29. However, clinical features such as irregular menses (56%) and acne (60%) were significantly more prevalent among women with PCOS (P < 0.01).
      
      
        Biochemical profile and OS markers
        Biochemical assessments showed that fasting blood sugar (FBS) and HbA1c levels were markedly higher in the PCOS group than in controls (P < 0.001). Similarly, PCOS group exhibited significantly higher luteinizing hormone (LH) levels accompanied by increased triglyceride (TG) concentrations at P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 respectively (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). PCOS group exhibited a notable increase in MDA levels, a marker of lipid peroxidation, compared to controls (P < 0.001). Conversely, antioxidant markers such as GSH and SOD were significantly reduced in women with PCOS (P < 0.001).
      
      
         Rare Earth element levels
        REE levels differed significantly across the groups analyzed. Serum levels of Dy, was significantly higher in the PCOS group than in controls (P < 0.001), along with elevated levels of Ce, In, and Y, which were significant at P < 0.05. However, the levels of Lu remain insignificant between the two groups (Table 1).
      
      
        Correlation analysis between REEs and OS markers
        To assess the link between elevated REE levels and OS markers, Pearson’s correlation analysis was carried out (Table 2). In the control group, no significant associations were detected between REEs and OS markers. However, distinct patterns emerged in the PCOS group: (a) for MDA, positive correlations were observed with Dy (r = 0.29, p = 0.04), Ce (r = 0.30, P = 0.03), and Y (r = 0.33, P = 0.02) in PCOS subjects, while correlations in controls were weaker and nonsignificant. Fisher’s z-test indicated significant differences between groups for Dy (z = 2.01, P = 0.031), Ce (z = 1.78, P = 0.037), and Y (z = 1.90, P = 0.049) and (b) antioxidant Status: In and Y exhibited negative correlations with antioxidant markers-GSH and SOD (P < 0.05). GSH correlated negatively with In (r = − 0.30, P = 0.034), with a significant between-group difference (z = − 2.24, P = 0.025). SOD showed significant negative correlations with Ce (r = − 0.33, P = 0.02) and In (r = − 0.31, p = 0.02), with Fisher’s z-tests confirming significant between-group differences (z = − 1.90, P = 0.049; z = − 2.39, P = 0.017, respectively). These findings suggest altered associations between REEs and OS markers in PCOS compared to controls. In multiple testing correction, the raw P-values for markers (MDA, SOD, GSH, Dy) ranged from 0.000013 to 0.00042, indicating significant differences between PCOS cases and controls. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, markers with P-values < 0.00013 remained statistically significant. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction/False Discovery Rate (FDR) identified additional significant markers with P-values up to 0.045 (Supplementary Table 3). MDA and Dy remained significant after both Bonferroni and FDR corrections, showing strong associations. SOD and GSH were significant after FDR but only partially after Bonferroni correction. Lu was not significant by either method. Ce, In, and Y were significant only after FDR correction. This indicates that FDR correction might be better suited for detecting relevant findings in this exploratory study. The correlations that remain significant after multiple testing correction—especially after FDR adjustment can be considered statistically meaningful within the exploratory context of the study. Correlation plots for these relationships in PCOS cases are provided in Figs. 1, 2 and 3.

        Inter-Element relationships
        Table 3 displays the inter-element correlation analysis of REEs in the PCOS group. Y exhibited strong significant positive correlations with Ce (r = 0.53, P < 0.001), and In (r = 0.70, P < 0.001). Additionally, Y demonstrated a moderate positive correlation with Dy (r = 0.41, P = 0.003). Further, a strong positive correlation was observed between In and Ce (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), suggesting a notable relationship between these elements. Lu showed no significant correlations with other elements in the study, indicating weaker relationships in comparison to other pairs. In summary, significant positive correlations were primarily observed between Yttrium (Y), Indium (In), and Cerium (Ce), while the other element combinations showed weak or no significant relationships.

      Discussion
      The findings of this study uncover a critical link between REEs and PCOS, highlighting their potential role in disrupting redox balance and contributing to OS. Women with PCOS exhibited significantly elevated serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, and Y compared to healthy controls, alongside reduced antioxidant defenses and a shift toward oxidative dominance. These results emphasize the impact of environmental exposure to REEs on reproductive health and suggest OS-induced metal toxicity as a key factor in the pathophysiology of PCOS.
      This study provides a new perspective on the environmental and biochemical influences underlying PCOS. REEs, commonly used in various industrial applications have garnered attention for their potential health impacts. However, the toxicity and biological effects of REEs on human reproductive health have been poorly studied, particularly in conditions such as PCOS. This study suggests that environmental exposure to REEs may exacerbate OS, contributing to the reproductive challenges observed in PCOS. Among the REE-Lutetium (Lu), dysprosium (Dy), cerium (Ce), indium (In), and yttrium (Y) play essential roles in modern technologies. Lutetium is primarily used in high-performance catalysts for petroleum refining and nuclear medicine for cancer treatment30. Dysprosium is crucial in the production of high-performance permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and electronics, and also finds applications in lasers and nuclear reactors31. Cerium, being the most abundant REE, is used in catalytic converters for automobiles to reduce emissions, in glass polishing, and the manufacturing of batteries and fuel cells32. Indium, typically extracted from zinc ores, is widely used in the production of thin-film photovoltaic cells, LCDs, and semiconductors, as well as in solders and alloys33. Yttrium, though relatively abundant among REEs, is essential in producing phosphors for displays, superconductors, lasers, and cancer treatments. These elements are extracted from minerals like bastnasite and monazite and have become critical components in technologies such as electronics, renewable energy systems, and environmental applications34. The growing use of REEs has resulted in their accumulation in soil and water, raising concerns about environmental and health risks, particularly regarding their effects on reproduction and pregnancy35,36. High doses of In have been shown to impair ovarian function and exhibit embryotoxic effects in animal studies37. Yttrium has also been reported to accumulate in reproductive tissues, which may interfere with normal reproductive processes; however, its human health impact remains uncertain38. Elevated serum REE levels have also been linked to adverse reproductive outcomes, including poor in vitro fertilization success, spontaneous abortion, and premature membrane rupture39. These effects highlight the distinct cytotoxic profiles of individual REEs across species and underscore the variability in their toxicological impacts.
      This study expands on previous research by examining REEs in women with PCOS and their potential links to OS. Notably, serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, and Y were significantly elevated in the PCOS cases relative to controls at P < 0.05. These elevated REE levels were positively associated with increased lipid peroxidation, as indicated by higher MDA levels (P < 0.05), and negatively correlated with reduced antioxidant markers, including SOD and GSH (P < 0.05). The findings of the current study are consistent with previous studies22,40,41. Significant positive correlations between REEs (Dy, Ce, Y) and MDA, along with negative correlations with antioxidants (GSH, SOD), were observed only in PCOS patients. These associations differed significantly from controls, indicating that REEs may specifically contribute to OS in PCOS. This highlights a potential role of REE exposure in the disease’s oxidative pathophysiology. The significant correlations between REEs in the PCOS group: Dy and Y (r = 0.41, P = 0.003), Ce and In (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), Ce and Y (r = 0.53, P = 0.0006), and In and Y (r = 0.70, P = 0.0001, further suggests interconnected roles of Dy, Ce, In, and Y in PCOS. Our findings demonstrate significant alterations in OS markers in PCOS cases compared to controls. The use of multiple testing corrections ensured that the reported associations are unlikely to be false positives. The Bonferroni correction, while conservative, confirmed the strongest associations (MDA, Dy), whereas the Benjamini-Hochberg method allowed for the detection of additional markers (Ce, In, Y) that may be biologically relevant. Overall, correcting for multiple testing ensured the reliability of the findings, with both conservative and liberal approaches highlighting key differences in oxidative and elemental profiles of PCOS patients versus controls.
      Despite decades of research, the precise pathogenesis of PCOS remains elusive. While its underlying causes are still being investigated, emerging evidence highlights OS as a critical factor in its development. The augmented OS in PCOS can be traced back to several sources. This study postulates that exposure to REEs such as Dy, Ce, In, and Y may contribute to the onset or progression of PCOS through OS-mediated mechanisms. REEs are known to induce OS by disrupting the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant defense systems42. Elevated OS has been documented in the follicular fluid and serum of women with PCOS, highlighting their significant contribution to the pathophysiology of the condition23. Among these biomarkers, malondialdehyde (MDA), a stable end-product of lipid peroxidation has proven to be a reliable indicator of oxidative damage. Studies have reported a 47% increase in circulating MDA levels in women with PCOS compared to controls, underscoring the role of lipid peroxidation in the metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions characteristic of the disorder43,44.
      Cells defend against free radical damage using antioxidant systems, including enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. Of prime importance, Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a key enzyme that neutralizes ROS by converting superoxide anions (O₂⁻) into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). There is conflicting evidence regarding SOD levels in PCOS, with some studies reporting elevated levels, while others have found decreased activity in serum and follicular fluid45,46. Increased SOD activity protects against OS-induced damage, while decreased activity can lead to apoptosis and corpus luteum regression41. These interactions emphasize the importance of SOD in ovarian function and reproductive health. Imbalances between antioxidants and ROS in follicular fluid can impair oocyte quality, potentially causing abnormal ovulation and infertility, as observed in PCOS patients42. Another key molecule in defending against OS is Glutathione (GSH), a major non-enzymatic antioxidant crucial for neutralizing oxidants and maintaining cellular redox balance. In PCOS, GSH depletion is likely due to elevated oxidants47,48. Presumably, heavy metals exacerbate this depletion by binding to GSH’s sulfhydryl (-SH) groups, forming organo-metallic complexes that disrupt their antioxidant function and further impair cellular defense mechanisms49,50. The OS in PCOS cases observed in the current study aligns with previous evidences. REE exposure in sea urchins led to a marked increase in OS, along with impaired fertilization outcomes and increased developmental defects in offspring as reviewed by Martino et al..,202212. Likewise, studies on algae, including common cyanobacteria, have revealed that Yttrium exposure impairs the antioxidant defense system, leading to increased OS51. More recently, elevated levels of similar elements and impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms in PCOS patients have also been reported18,19,50. Together, these studies highlight the role of REEs in amplifying OS, potentially influencing reproductive health outcomes like those observed in PCOS.
      As reported in previous studies, elevated OS significantly compromises oocyte quality by inducing lipid peroxidation, which impairs maturation and increases the prevalence of immature oocyte25. Moreover, OS disrupts granulosa cell function, which is critical for follicular growth and steroid hormone production, resulting in anovulation, a hallmark of infertility in PCOS43. These disruptions not only impair follicle maturation but also alter the endometrial environment, further intensifying reproductive challenges in women with PCOS. In summary, REEs may worsen PCOS by triggering OS, disturbing endocrine function, and hindering follicle development, all of which contribute to the onset or exacerbation of the condition. To better understand the mechanistic role of REEs in PCOS pathophysiology, future studies should focus on both in vitro and in vivo models. Cellular experiments using ovarian granulosa cells or theca cells could investigate how exposure to elevated REEs affects oxidative stress pathways, mitochondrial function, and steroidogenesis, key processes altered in PCOS. Assessing changes in ROS generation, antioxidant enzyme activity, and expression of genes regulating inflammation and hormone synthesis would clarify direct cellular effects. Animal models of PCOS could be used to evaluate systemic impacts of REE exposure on reproductive and metabolic phenotypes, including hormonal profiles, follicular development, and insulin resistance. Additionally, exploring potential REE-induced epigenetic modifications might uncover long-term regulatory changes contributing to PCOS progression. Human studies incorporating longitudinal designs could assess whether environmental or dietary REE exposure correlates with PCOS onset or severity. Integrating multi-omics approaches, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, may reveal downstream molecular networks perturbed by REEs. Together, these approaches would provide comprehensive insight into how REEs influence PCOS development and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
    
    
      Conclusion
      This study highlights the potential role of REE-induced oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of PCOS. The observed trends point to the need for greater awareness of environmental pollutants in reproductive health. These preliminary findings open new avenues for exploring environmental contributors to PCOS and underscore oxidative stress as a potential therapeutic target.
      
        Limitations of the study:
        While this study is among the first to assess associations between REEs and oxidative stress in PCOS, it did not account for environmental or lifestyle confounders (e.g., diet, pollution, occupational or cosmetic exposure) that may influence REE levels and oxidative stress. The Bonferroni correction, while conservative, confirmed the strongest associations (MDA, Dy), whereas the FDR method allowed the detection of additional markers (Ce, In, Y) that may be biologically relevant but require validation. Future studies should explore the clinical implications of these markers and validate the borderline findings.
      
    
    
      Method
      
        Study design and participants
        This case-controlled study involved women aged 19 to 35 years, divided into two groups: Group I, comprising 50 healthy controls, and Group II, consisting of 56 women diagnosed with PCOS. The study recruited participants from the Section of Obstetrics and Gynecology at King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, located in Riyadh. Ethical clearance was granted by the hospital’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), under approval number E-18-3536. All procedures followed the ethical standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to participation, each individual provided written informed consent.
      
      
        Inclusion and exclusion criteria
        
          PCOS Group:
          Women who met at least two of the following criteria were included in the PCOS group: (a) hyperandrogenism, (b) polycystic ovarian morphology, or (c) experiencing oligo- or amenorrhea, characterized by less than 8 menstrual cycles within a 12-month period. These cases were screened based on the Rotterdam criteria52.
        
        
          Control group:
          Healthy females without any symptoms of hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, infertility, or ultrasound findings suggestive of PCOS.
        
        
          Exclusion criteria:
          Patients on lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications, pregnant women, and those with diabetes, anemia, cancer, infections, thromboembolism, stroke, or ischemic heart disease were excluded.
        
      
      
        Sample collection and baseline characteristics
        Approximately 5 mL of blood was collected from each participant after obtaining written informed consent. The blood was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm to isolate the serum, which was then stored at −80 °C until further analysis to preserve its integrity. Baseline characteristics were assessed using an autoanalyzer, with the Mediserv 3700/Cell Dyne (STA Compact) and Roche Elecsys 2010 (Modular Analytics E170-Cobas e 411) for relevant tests.
      
      
        Detection of oxidative stress
        
          Lipid peroxidation (Malondialdehyde- MDA assay):
          MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were quantified using the MDA Assay Kit (ab118970; Abcam). A standard curve was created with MDA concentrations ranging from 4 to 20 nmol/well or 20–100 µM. The assay measures the formation of MDA-TBA adducts at 532 nm, with a sensitivity of > 0.1 nmol/well. MDA levels were reported in nmol/ml.
        
        
          Antioxidant markers (GSH and SOD):
          Glutathione (GSH) levels and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity were assessed using the Glutathione Assay Kit (CS0260; Sigma) and the SOD Assay Kit- Water-Soluble Tetrazolium salt; WST (19160; Sigma), respectively. In the GSH assay, the formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB), resulting from the reduction of 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), is monitored by measuring its absorbance at 412 nm, with GSH levels expressed in mg/ml. For SOD activity, absorbance at 450 nm was measured after incubating the samples with Water-Soluble Tetrazolium salt (WST) and enzyme working solutions at 37 °C for 20 min. SOD activity was reported in IU/ml.
        
      
      
        Quantification of REE
        Once thawed, serum samples were centrifuged to remove cells, resulting in clear serum. A volume of one milliliter of sera was diluted with a solution of 0.5% nitric acid and 0.01% Triton X-100 to ensure the elements remained dissolved and stable. Subsequently, levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu were measured using the Perkin Elmer NexION 2000G ICP-MS. Certified reference materials (CRMs) with a concentration of 1000 ppm were employed for calibration, and serum metal levels were quantified in parts per billion (ppb). A calibration curve was established with working standards covering 0.025 to 100 ppb. Each standard concentration was measured three times, and a multi-point linear regression was used to correlate signal intensity with concentration. To enhance measurement accuracy and reduce matrix effects, a constant amount of germanium (Ge) was added as an internal standard to all serum samples. The resulting calibration curve exhibited excellent linearity, with a coefficient of determination (R²) exceeding 0.999. LOD values for each element were calculated by assessing the distinction between blank sample signals and background interference, with detection limits as low as 0.025 ppb, reflecting the high sensitivity of the ICP-MS instrument. The method demonstrated strong reliability, with measurement accuracy ranging from 0.3 to 22.8% and precision between 0.8% and 11.8%.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Data analysis was conducted using Sigma Plot version 12. About 56 PCOS cases and 50 healthy controls were initially recruited; statistical analyses were conducted on 50 participants in each group. Six PCOS samples were excluded due to poor sample quality or missing data, resulting in a final sample size of 100 (50 per group) for all comparisons and correlation analyses. The exact number of data points used in each analysis was consistent. The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed the normality of paired differences, allowing the use of paired t-tests for comparison of measured variables. Pearson’s correlation was performed to examine associations between REEs and OS markers. Differences between correlation coefficients in the PCOS and control groups were assessed using Fisher’s z-transformation followed by a two-tailed z-test. To account for the issue of multiple hypothesis testing, P-values were adjusted using both the Bonferroni correction and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (FDR). For Bonferroni correction, the significance threshold was set at P < 0.003. For the FDR, adjusted P-values were evaluated at a significant level of 0.05. Scatter plots were used to visualize correlations between REEs, MDA, GSH, and SOD.

Title: Long-term Safety and Effectiveness of Cold-Crosslinked Hyaluronic Acid Fillers: Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Double-Blind Study

Abstract: AbstractBackgroundEvolysse Form (EVLF) and Evolysse Smooth (EVLS) (Symatese, Chaponost, France) are new hyaluronic acid fillers created using an innovative cold-crosslinking process.ObjectivesThe authors of this study aim to collect safety and effectiveness data on new cold-crosslinked fillers to support the US approval for the correction of moderate-to-severe dynamic facial wrinkles and folds.MethodsIn this randomized, controlled, split-face study, 140 patients with moderate-to-severe nasolabial folds (NLFs) received a cold-crosslinked filler in 1 NLF (EVLF = 70, EVLS = 70) and a traditionally crosslinked filler, Restylane-L (RESL), in the contralateral fold and were followed through 12 months with an optional retreatment at that time point and subsequent 3 months of safety follow-up.ResultsThe primary endpoint of mean Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale change from baseline to Month 6 as rated by the photographic review panel demonstrated noninferiority and statistical superiority for the cold-crosslinked fillers. Blinded evaluator Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale assessments showed a mean change from baseline that was statistically significantly better than RESL for EVLF at all visits through 12 months and for EVLS at 6 and 9 months. Most patients were responders on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale throughout the study, according to ratings by blinded evaluators, treating investigators, and patients. The FACE-Q appraisal of NLFs’ overall mean score showed significant improvement from baseline (P < .0001) at all time points through Month 12 for all treatment groups.

Body: Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are widely used in aesthetic treatments because of their biocompatibility. Crosslinking of the HA molecules is a necessary step to create fillers with appropriate mechanical properties and duration in the skin, and the BDDE (1,4-Butanediol diglycidyl ether) crosslinker enables the HA molecules to resist enzymatic and oxidative degradation. The crosslinking step in manufacturing fillers is traditionally done at an elevated pH and in a heated state, and the highly alkaline conditions activate the BDDE epoxide rings, which leads to the crosslinking of the HA by forming covalent bonds. However, in this caustic environment, HA fragmentation can occur, further exacerbated by thermal energy (eg, heat) of the reaction conditions.1,2 Evolysse Form (EVLF) and Evolysse Smooth (EVLS) (Symatese, Chaponost, France) are new HA fillers created using an innovative cold-crosslinking process (Cold-X Technology). Performing the crosslinking process in a cold state helps to better preserve the long HA chains and requires less BDDE to achieve the targeted rheological properties. Less fragmentation of the HA chains aims to improve safety as well as the performance and duration of the fillers.
    The purpose of this pivotal study was to collect safety and effectiveness data on the new cold-crosslinked injectable HA gels, EVLF and EVLS, which supported approval by the US FDA for the correction of moderate-to-severe dynamic facial wrinkles and folds.
    
      METHODS
      
        Study Design
        This randomized, controlled, split-face study was conducted at 6 sites in the United States, with patients and evaluators being blinded to which HA filler was injected in each nasolabial fold (NLF), and investigators who performed the treatments being unblinded. Patients were randomized using an electronic data capture system in a 1:1:2 ratio to receive one of the EVL fillers in 1 NLF and Restylane-L (RESL; Q-Med AB, Sweden) in the other (side of the face for each treatment was randomized), and randomization was stratified by Fitzpatrick skin type (I-III and IV-VI) and investigational site to ensure balance between treatment arms. Follow-up visits occurred 2 and 6 weeks after initial treatment as well as at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients electing to receive retreatment at 12 months were followed at 2 weeks and 3 months after that for safety only.
        The study was reviewed and approved by WCG IRB and was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT0532541; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05325411?term=NCT05325411&rank=1). Written consent was provided, by which the patients agreed to the use and analysis of their data. All study visits occurred between May 2022 and March 2024.
      
      
        Patients
        Patients were required to be aged 22 and older and have moderate or severe NLFs on the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) as scored live by a blinded evaluator. Washout periods were 2 weeks for topical treatments (prescription wrinkle treatments, steroids, and self-tanners), 3 months for noninvasive skin-tightening treatments, 6 months for ablative or nonablative dermal resurfacing procedures, and 12 months for neurotoxin injections below the orbital rim and nonpermanent facial fillers. Patients with any history of permanent facial fillers were excluded.
      
      
        Treatment
        Patients received a cold-crosslinked filler (EVLF or EVLS) in 1 NLF and a traditionally crosslinked filler (RESL) approved for NLF treatment in the contralateral NLF. HA concentration was 22 mg/mL for EVLF and 20 mg/mL for EVLS and RESL, and all 3 fillers were crosslinked with BDDE and contained 0.3% lidocaine to minimize injection pain. Initial treatment and optional touch-up 2 weeks later were with the randomized fillers in each respective NLF, and optional retreatment at 12 months plus accompanying optional touch-up were with the EVL fillers in both NLFs as needed. Treatments were performed according to each product's instructions for use, which included linear threading (antegrade and retrograde), crosshatching, and serial puncture as options for injection techniques. Injection volume was determined by the treating investigators.
      
      
        Assessments
        The validated 5-point photonumeric WSRS was used by blinded evaluators at screening and all follow-up visits from 6 weeks through 12 months to rate NLFs as absent, mild, moderate, severe, or extreme.3 An independent photographic review panel of 3 physicians performed assessments with the same scale using photographs from screening and Month 6 visits.
        Blinded evaluators, treating investigators, and patients all performed assessments on the 5-point Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS: very much improved, much improved, improved, no change, and worse) by comparing screening photographs to live appearance at all follow-up visits from 6 weeks through 12 months. Patients completed the validated FACE-Q appraisal of NLF questionnaire at screening and all follow-up visits from 6 weeks through 12 months to rate how bothered they were by various aspects of their NLFs on a 4-point scale (not at all, a little, moderately, and extremely).4 At the same time points, patients used screening photographs for comparison and completed the Aesthetic Appearance Questionnaire to rate treatment outcomes on 4-point satisfaction scales (very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, and very dissatisfied) or 5-point agreement scales (strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree). Immediately after each study treatment and at 10, 20, and 30 min, patients rated pain in each NLF in half-point increments on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. For all effectiveness assessments, each NLF was rated individually.
        For 30 days after each study treatment, patients completed daily diaries to rate the intensity of common treatment responses as mild, moderate, or severe. At all study visits, adverse events (AEs) were collected, and Snellen eye examinations and ocular movement assessments were performed (at least 30 min after study injections at treatment visits).
      
      
        Statistics
        The primary endpoint was the mean WSRS change from baseline to Month 6 as rated by the photographic review panel for the modified intent-to-treat population and analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Secondary endpoints were evaluated for the modified intent-to-treat population and included WSRS responder rates (NLFs with at least 1-grade improvement), according to photographic review panel and blinded evaluators (95% CIs); WSRS mean change (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and superiority or equivalence as assessed by blinded evaluators; GAIS improvement as assessed by blinded evaluators, treating investigators, and patients (95% CIs); FACE-Q appraisal of NLF improvement vs baseline (paired t test); and pain scale (95% CIs). An additional endpoint was the Aesthetic Appearance Questionnaire (95% CIs). Analyses of WSRS mean change and responder rate at Month 6 were performed with 95% CIs for the subgroups of sex, race, ethnicity, age group, Fitzpatrick skin type, injection volume, baseline WSRS score, and touch-up status.
        Common treatment responses and AEs were coded to MedDRA terms and summarized with descriptive statistics. Subgroup analyses of common treatment responses and AEs were performed by sex, race, ethnicity, age group, Fitzpatrick skin type, injection volume, baseline WSRS score, touch-up status, and needle size.
        Sample size was calculated using statistical software PASS version 16.0.4 and determined that a minimum of 25 patients were needed in each study arm to achieve at least 95% power with a noninferiority margin of 0.5 points for the primary endpoint. However, the study sought to enroll 70 patients in each arm to collect adequate safety data and account for potential attrition.
      
    
    
      RESULTS
      
        Patient and Treatment Characteristics
        A total of 141 patients were randomized, with 1 patient in the EVLF arm discontinuing before treatment, resulting in 70 treated patients in each study arm (Table 1). The majority of treated patients finished follow-up through the entirety of the study, with 87.1% (61/70) in the EVLF arm and 92.9% (65/70) in the EVLS arm completing the study. Most patients were female and white, and all Fitzpatrick skin types were represented. All patients had each NLF rated as moderate or severe on the WSRS as required in the study eligibility criteria.

        Of the 70 patients in the EVLF arm, 51 received touch-up with EVLF and 52 with RESL, with a mean volume injected for initial and touch-up treatments combined of 1.2 mL for EVLF (range, 0.2-3.0 mL) and 1.3 mL for RESL (range, 0.5-3.2 mL). Retreatment was performed for 44 of the EVLF NLFs and 47 of the control NLFs, with a mean total EVLF volume injected for retreatment and retreatment touch-up treatments combined of 0.8 mL for each NLF (range, 0.02-1.9 mL).
        Of the 70 patients in the EVLS arm, 54 received touch-up in each NLF, with a mean volume injected for initial and touch-up treatments combined of 1.0 mL for EVLS (range, 0.4-1.9 mL) and 1.2 mL for RESL (range, 0.5-3.0 mL). Retreatment was performed for 44 NLFs on each side, with a mean total EVLS volume injected for retreatment and retreatment touch-up treatments combined of 0.6 mL for each NLF (range, 0.05-1.4 mL).
        The needle size was 27 G (54.3%) or 30 G (45.7%) for EVLF injections, 30 G for EVLS injections, and 29 G for all control injections. The most common injection techniques for all NLFs were retrograde linear threading (82.9%-85.7%) and crosshatching (38.6%-40.0%).
      
      
        Effectiveness
        For the EVLF primary endpoint (n = 62), the absolute difference in the mean WSRS change from baseline to Month 6 for EVLF vs RESL was −0.27 (95% CI, −0.500 to −0.032), favoring EVLF, and the upper bound of the 95% CI was <0.5 threshold, so noninferiority was concluded (Figure 1), and statistical superiority was supported by the CIs not crossing zero and a corresponding P-value of <.001.

        Similarly, for the EVLS primary endpoint (n = 62), the absolute difference in the mean WSRS change from baseline to Month 6 for EVLS vs RESL was −0.22 (95% CI, −0.416 to −0.019), favoring EVLS, and the upper bound of the 95% CI was <0.5 threshold, so noninferiority was concluded (Figure 2), and statistical superiority was supported by the CIs not crossing zero and a corresponding P-value of <.001.

        Blinded evaluator live assessments of WSRS showed a mean change from baseline that was significantly better for EVLF than RESL at all visits through 12 months (Figure 3) and the vast majority of EVLF NLFs remained responders throughout the study (Figure 4). EVLS was significantly better than RESL at 6 and 9 months (Figure 5) and the vast majority of EVLS NLFs remained responders throughout the study (Figure 6). Example photographs of the lasting correction are provided in Figure 7 for an EVLF patient and Figure 8 for EVLS patient. Month 6 WSRS responder rates per the photographic review panel were 45.2% for EVLF and 38.7% for RESL and 51.6% for EVLS and 35.5% for RESL. At all time points, blinded evaluators most commonly rated both NLFs as equivalent on the WSRS, with superior ratings more common for the EVL NLFs. For example, at Month 6 in the EVLF arm, 49.2% were equivalent, 38.1% EVLF superior, and 12.7% RESL superior; in the EVLS arm, 69.4% were equivalent, 25.8% EVLS superior, and 4.8% RESL superior.

        Most patients were responders on the GAIS throughout the study, according to ratings by blinded evaluators (6 weeks: EVLF 96.9%, RESL 100%; EVLS 97.0%, RESL 97.0%; 12 months: EVLF 73.8%, RESL 60.7%; EVLS 66.2%, RESL 66.2%), treating investigators (6 weeks: EVLF 96.9%, RESL 98.5%; EVLS 100%, RESL 100%; 12 months: EVLF 77.0%, RESL 65.6%; EVLS 73.8%, RESL 66.2%), and patients (6 weeks: EVLF 95.4%, RESL 93.8%; EVLS 98.5%, RESL 98.5%; 12 months: EVLF 80.3%, RESL 72.1%; EVLS 92.3%, RESL 86.2%).
        The FACE-Q appraisal of NLFs’ overall mean score showed significant improvement from baseline (P < .0001) at all time points through Month 12 for all treatment groups. Before treatment, 88.6% of patients were extremely or moderately bothered by the depth of their EVLF NLFs, which improved to 31.7% at Month 6; for EVLS NLFs, it was 82.9% improving to 24.2%.
        On the 0 to 10 pain scale, mean injection pain for these fillers with lidocaine was 2.7 to 3.0 across the treatment groups, with all reducing to 0.2 at 30 min after injection.
        Assessments of these new fillers on the Aesthetic Appearance Questionnaire showed that at Month 6 for the EVLF NLFs 79.4% of patients reported that their NLF looked better overall, 84.1% that the results looked natural, 82.5% that the results felt natural, 84.1% that they would receive the treatment again, and 82.5% that they would recommend the treatment to friends. Likewise, for the EVLS NLFs 83.6% of patients reported that their NLF looked better overall, 86.9% that the results looked natural, 88.5% that the results felt natural, 90.2% that they would receive the treatment again, and 87.1% that they would recommend the treatment to friends.
        Subgroup analyses demonstrated that EVLF and EVLS are effective for moderate and severe NLFs in both men and women and all races, ethnicities, Fitzpatrick skin phototypes, and age groups, with or without touch-up treatment.

        The most common treatment responses after initial treatment for all treatment groups were injection-site swelling and tenderness (Tables 2, 3). These were also the most common responses after retreatment though the rates were lower (swelling 52.2%-54.5% with EVLF, 44.2%-46.5% with EVLS; tenderness 45.7%-52.3% with EVLF, 41.9%-44.2% with EVLS). Most treatment responses were mild or moderate severity and resolved within 1 week for all NLFs after initial treatment and retreatment.

        In the EVLF arm, there were treatment-related AEs in 11 EVLF NLFs (15.7%) and 8 RESL NLFs (11.4%) after initial treatment, most commonly injection-site mass (8.6% for EVLF, 2.9% for RESL), with pain, swelling, pruritus, discomfort, discoloration, bruising, inflammation, nodule, jaw pain, and foreign body sensation occurring in 1 or 2 patients each. After retreatment, 1 patient had injection-site pain in each NLF, and 1 had a headache. All treatment-related AEs were mild severity except for 1 moderate severity jaw pain for RESL, and all resolved. There were 2 delayed-onset AEs that occurred in RESL NLFs 6 months after touch-up treatment, and both of these required treatment. One patient received oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids for injection-site inflammation, and 1 patient received oral antibiotics for injection-site nodule; both resolved within 3 weeks after treatment.
        In the EVLS arm, there were treatment-related AEs in 5 EVLS NLFs (7.1%) and 6 RESL NLFs (8.6%) after initial treatment, most commonly injection-site discoloration (4.3%), injection-site mass (2.9% for EVLS, 4.3% for RESL), and injection-site erythema (2.9%) in both NLFs, with pain, swelling, pruritus, bruising, flushing, and papule occurring in just a single patient each. After retreatment there was 1 bilateral injection-site bruising and 1 each unilateral injection-site mass, injection-site pain, and injection-site swelling. All treatment-related AEs were mild or moderate severity and resolved.
        There were no treatment-related serious AEs and no changes in extraocular motility or confrontation visual fields throughout the study. There was 1 patient with a transient decrease in visual acuity from 20/25 at screening to 20/30 at Week 6 and a return to 20/25 at Month 3 and all subsequent time points.
        Because of the small sample size, safety data are limited for Fitzpatrick skin Types V and VI for EVLF. However, subgroup analyses supported safety across subgroups by sex, race, ethnicity, age group, Fitzpatrick skin type, injection volume, baseline WSRS score, touch-up status, and needle size.
      
    
    
      DISCUSSION
      With the results of this study, the authors showed that the new cold-crosslinked fillers are safe and effective for correction of NLFs. The primary endpoints were met, demonstrating that EVLF and EVLS were both noninferior to RESL and further that they were statistically superior according to evaluations by an independent photographic review panel. Blinded evaluator live WSRS ratings showed that the vast majority of EVLF and EVLS NLFs remained responders throughout the 12-month follow-up period, with mean change from baseline that was significantly better than RESL at all visits through 12 months for EVLF (despite similar injection volumes: mean 1.2 mL for EVLF and 1.3 mL for RESL) and at 6 and 9 months for EVLS (despite lower injection volume mean of 1.0 mL for EVLS and 1.2 mL for RESL). Safety assessments showed that all of the fillers were safe and tolerable, with expected treatment responses and AEs for filler injections. As anticipated for fillers containing lidocaine, procedural pain was minimal for the new fillers and the control filler.
      The blinded evaluator live WSRS responder rates were substantially higher than those from the independent photographic review panel, but this finding is consistent with other filler studies. A study of Juvéderm Voluma XC (Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie company, Irvine, CA) had Month 6 responder rates on the validated Allergan Chin Retrusion Scale of 91.8% for live assessments vs 56.3% for photographic assessments.5 Similarly, a study of RESL and Juvéderm Volbella XC (Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie company) had Month 3 responder rates on the validated Allergan Lip Fullness Scale of 81.4% and 84.2%, respectively, for live assessments vs 29.3% and 34.1%, respectively, for photographic assessments. This is not unexpected given that photographic images provide less detail than live evaluations.6
      In an earlier randomized, controlled split-face European study,7 45 patients were treated with EVLF and RESL in their NLFs, and the primary endpoint of mean WSRS change at 1 month by blinded evaluator demonstrated noninferiority of EVLF as well as statistical superiority (P < .001). Furthermore, secondary endpoints showed significantly better mean WSRS scores for EVLF than RESL at 3 months (P = .018) and 6 months (P = .037). Objective measurements of wrinkle volume with the fringe projection system DermaTOP (Eotech, France) showed that despite the same mean injection volume for both products, the NLF volume was significantly better for EVLF at 6 months (P = .038). On the GAIS, patient ratings showed similar results for both products, whereas blinded evaluator ratings showed significantly better results for EVLF at 3 and 6 months. Both products resulted in mild-to-moderate transient injection-site responses and AEs.
      EVLS was evaluated in a previous prospective, multicenter, open-label study8 in which 72 patients received a single treatment with another cold-crosslinked HA filler (ESTYME LIPS, Symatese, France) in their lips, and 61 patients also received EVLS in their NLFs and lip fine lines. On 6-point validated scales, mean NLF improvement ranged from 1.3 points at 30 days to 0.7 points at 12 months, and mean lip fine lines improvement ranged from 1.6 points at 30 days to 1 point at 12 months. A majority of patients were responders at all time points through 12 months on the validated scales as well as investigator and patient ratings on the GAIS. Injection-site responses and AEs were primarily of mild severity.
      Limitations of this study include a comparison with only a single HA injectable control, recognizing that this is standard for FDA registration studies, and time to complete loss of correction was not established as the majority of EVLF and EVLS NLFs continued to show improvement at the end of the study.
    
    
      CONCLUSIONS
      The new cold-crosslinked fillers were shown to be safe and effective for correction of NLFs, with results lasting for 1 year.

Title: Multiomics analysis revealed the regulatory role of chenodeoxycholic acid in fatty acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis

Abstract: ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the regulatory role and mechanisms of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on lipid metabolism, and to evaluate its therapeutic potential in lipid metabolism-related diseases such as acne, seborrheic alopecia, and prostate cancer, with the aim of identifying safer and more sustainable treatment alternatives.MethodsLipid-overproduction models were established using RM-1 (murine prostate cancer cells) and primary sebaceous gland cells, stimulated by linoleic acid (LA) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), respectively. CDCA’s mechanisms were explored using transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics. In vivo validation was conducted via intradermal injection of CDCA into the sebaceous gland area of golden hamsters to assess its effect on sebaceous lipid metabolism.ResultsCDCA significantly reduced intracellular lipid accumulation in both murine prostate cancer cells (RM-1) and primary sebaceous gland cells, and suppressed the expression of the androgen receptor (AR), along with the downregulation of key lipogenic enzymes (SREBF1, FASN, FADS2). Mitochondrial membrane potential was restored in CDCA-treated cells. Multi-omics analyses revealed that CDCA modulated fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation, energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPAR-γ) signaling. Lipidomic profiling demonstrated a shift from saturated to unsaturated fatty acid dominance after CDCA treatment. In vivo, CDCA decreased sebaceous lipid accumulation and downregulated PPAR-γ expression in golden hamsters.ConclusionCDCA exerted multifaceted regulatory effects on lipid metabolism, hormone signaling, and mitochondrial dynamics. These effects contributed to the maintenance of sebaceous gland homeostasis and supported the development of innovative and potentially more biocompatible therapies for lipid-related disorders.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02656-w.

Body: Introduction
      Lipid homeostasis refers to the state in which organisms maintain the balance of lipid levels, encompassing multiple aspects such as fatty acid metabolism. As fundamental units of lipid metabolism, fatty acids play pivotal roles in critical physiological processes including energy supply, cellular membrane structure, and signal transduction [1–3]. However, dysregulation of lipid metabolism is closely associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases, particularly in cancer and dermatological disorders. For instance, in prostate cancer, aberrant lipid metabolism not only contributes to tumorigenesis but also correlates with malignant progression and therapeutic resistance [4–6]. In dermatology, disrupted lipid metabolism is implicated in acne and seborrheic alopecia. Excessive lipid accumulation drives acne pathogenesis, while abnormal lipid metabolism may alter the follicular microenvironment in seborrheic alopecia [7, 8]. Thus, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of lipid homeostasis is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and developing novel therapeutic strategies.
      Bear bile, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely utilized for its heat-clearing, detoxifying, liver-soothing, and vision-improving properties. Ancient texts such as the Xiao’ er Weisheng Zongwei Lun Fang (Compendium of Pediatric Health and Refined Prescriptions) documented the use of “Xiongdan Shexiang Wan” (Bear Bile and Musk Pill) to treat pediatric malnutrition syndromes, stating: “For treating pediatric malnutrition syndromes, abdominal distension, pica, and persistent fever” [9]. The term “malnutrition syndromes” in modern contexts may correlate with metabolic disorders, including malnutrition and digestive dysfunction, both linked to lipid metabolism. Studies indicate that bear bile powder improves lipid profiles by reducing total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) while elevating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels [10–12]. Furthermore, clinical research demonstrates that bear bile-containing formulations and bear bile powder itself exhibit efficacy in managing lipid metabolism disorders such as hyperlipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [13, 14]. These findings highlight bear bile’s potential in modulating fatty acid metabolism and maintaining lipid homeostasis.
      Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), the primary bioactive components of bear bile powder [15–17], have shown therapeutic promise in metabolic disorders. Both bile acids improve hepatic function, regulate cholesterol metabolism, and mitigate inflammation, with established clinical applications in NAFLD and primary biliary cholangitis [18–20].
      However, despite this growing recognition, the potential of CDCA in regulating fatty acid metabolism outside hepatic contexts—particularly in tumor biology and dermatological lipid disorders—remains largely unexplored.
      In particular, the roles of CDCA in sebaceous lipid metabolism and its molecular targets in prostate cancer and sebaceous glands have not been systematically elucidated.
      Addressing this gap may offer new insights into the extrahepatic functions of bile acids and contribute to the development of novel metabolic therapies for skin and cancer-related disorders.
      Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of CDCA in modulating fatty acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis in both prostate cancer and sebaceous gland models. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics, the study sought to elucidate the molecular pathways involved and identify potential therapeutic targets of CDCA in the context of cancer and dermatological lipid disorders.
    
    
      Materials and methods
      
        Cell culture of RM-1 and primary sebaceous gland cells
        RM-1 cells (CL-0198, Procell Life Science & Technology, Wuhan, China) and primary sebaceous gland cells (CTCC-280-HUM, Meisen Cell Technology, Hangzhou, China) were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37℃ with 5% CO2. Humidity was maintained by placing 3000 mL of sterile distilled water in the incubator to prevent medium evaporation. RM-1 cells were cultured in DMEM medium (SH30022.01, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (PSA). Primary sebaceous gland cells were maintained in specialized epithelial cell medium (CTCC-009-613, Meisen Cell Technology, Hangzhou, China), composed of basal medium, 10% FBS, 1% epithelial cell growth supplement (ECGS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells within passages 4–8 were used for experiments. Routine subculturing was performed when cells reached 80% confluency.
        STR profiling confirmed that the sebaceous gland cells were of human origin, consistent with the supplier’s documentation. In addition, immunostaining for keratin 7 (KRT7)—a cytoskeletal protein expressed in epithelial lineages including sebaceous cells—was used to further support their identity (Supplementary Material 3). All STR authentication results are provided in Supplementary Materials 1–3.
      
      
        CCK-8 assay
        RM-1 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in culture medium. Cell suspensions (8,000 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ until adherent. Cholic acid (CA, 81-25-4, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), deoxycholic acid (DCA, 83-44-3, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), UDCA (128-13-2, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and CDCA(474-25-9, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were diluted in serum-free medium to concentrations of 0–500 µmol/L. After 24 h of treatment, 10 µL of CCK-8 solution (CK04, Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) and 90 µL of serum-free medium were added to each well. Plates were gently shaken to ensure uniform distribution and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Cell proliferation rates were calculated as:
        Cell viability (%) = [(Experimental group– Blank control) / (Negative control– Blank control)] × 100.
      
      
        Nile red staining for lipid detection
        RM-1 and primary sebaceous gland cells in the logarithmic phase were seeded into 96-well plates (8,000 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. Groups included: normal control, LA-treated (0.1 mmol/L for RM-1; 0.0125 mmol/L for primary sebaceous gland cells), and LA combined with CA/DCA/UDCA/CDCA. After 24 h of treatment, cells were exposed to 20 µg/mL dihydrotestosterone (DHT, D413176, Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) for 48 h. Medium was discarded, and cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min each). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (50 µL/well, 20 min), washed with PBS, stained with Nile Red (7385-67-3, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) (50 µL/well, 20 min, dark), and washed again. Triton X-100 (0.5%, 50 µL/well, 5 min) and DAPI (5 min) were sequentially applied. Fluorescence was visualized using an inverted microscope (CKX41, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
      
      
        Mitochondrial membrane potential assay
        Cells were treated for 24 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with 1 mL mitochondrial membrane potential probe (JC-10) staining working solution (CA1310, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) at 37 °C for 20 min. JC-10 staining buffer (1×) was prepared by diluting 5× stock with distilled water (1:4) and stored on ice. After incubation, cells were washed twice with 1× buffer and observed under a fluorescence microscope.
      
      
        qPCR analysis of lipid metabolism genes in RM-1
        Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (15596018, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), reverse-transcribed with ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix (FSQ-201, TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), and quantified. qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Premix (PK-201, TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) in 20 µL reactions (95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles). GAPDH served as the reference gene. Relative mRNA levels were calculated via the 2^−ΔΔCt method. The PCR primer (Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Material 4.
      
      
        Western blot analysis
        After 24 h of treatment, cells were harvested for protein extraction. Protein lysates were normalized based on concentration, mixed with loading buffer, and denatured at 100 °C for 10 min. Approximately 20–40 µg of protein (in a volume of 5–15 µL) per lane was separated by SDS-PAGE at 200 V. After the bromophenol blue front reached the gel bottom, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against fatty acid synthase (FASN), sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), and Histone 3 (all diluted 1:1000). Notably, the anti-FASN (A19050), anti-FADS2 (A24354), and anti-Histone 3 (A4835) antibodies were obtained from Abclonal Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China), while the anti-SREBF1 antibody (14088-1-AP) was purchased from Proteintech (Rosemont, IL, USA). The next day, membranes were washed thrice with TBST (10 min each) and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by further TBST washes. Signal detection was performed using ECL reagents and visualized on a ChemiDoc imaging system (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA).
      
      
        Multi-Omics profiling
        
          RNA-Seq
          Cell samples from RM-1 were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground, and lysed in 1 mL of pre-chilled Trizol. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Next, 200 µL of pre-chilled chloroform was added, mixed vigorously, and allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature. Following another centrifugation, the aqueous phase was collected, mixed with an equal volume of pre-chilled isopropanol, and incubated for 10 min. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed with 1 mL of 75% ethanol, briefly air-dried (3–5 min), and resuspended in 20–50 µL of 0.1% DEPC-treated water. The total RNA was then used for mRNA enrichment, fragmentation, cDNA synthesis, adapter ligation, and subsequent sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq Xplus platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data analysis—including read alignment, expression quantification, differential expression analysis, and KEGG enrichment using the Python SciPy package—was performed. Please refer to Supplementary Material 5 for details.
        
        
          Fatty acid metabolomics
          primary sebaceous gland cells samples (300 µL per sample, diluted 2×) were stored at − 80 °C. A mixed standard solution of 50 common fatty acids was prepared at 2000 µg/mL and further diluted using a 50% acetonitrile–isopropanol solution. Isotopically labeled internal standards were also prepared. Fatty acids were extracted using acetonitrile and isopropanol to ensure efficient recovery. Quantification was performed using UHPLC-MS/MS (AB SCIEX ExionLC™ AD system coupled with a QTRAP® 6500 + mass spectrometer) in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Standard curves generated from known concentrations were used to determine sample concentrations, with statistical analyses performed using Microsoft Excel and appropriate statistical software.
        
        
          Deep data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics
          Proteins from primary sebaceous gland cell samples were extracted and analyzed using an Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer in a DIA workflow. This method enables simultaneous collection of fragment data from all precursor ions, providing enhanced coverage and reproducibility compared to data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Quantitative analysis was conducted using DIA-NN software with retention time calibration via internal peptide standards. Differentially expressed proteins were defined as those with expression changes greater than 1.2-fold or less than 0.83-fold and a P-value < 0.05. Functional annotation and enrichment analyses were carried out using the COG, GO, and KEGG databases, and protein–protein interaction networks were constructed to elucidate biological functions.
        
      
      
        Golden hamster model
        Three SPF-grade golden hamsters (average weight ~ 120 g, 8 weeks old) were procured from Beijing Weitong Lihua Experimental Animal Technology Co., Ltd. and housed in the Animal Experimental Facility of the Institute of Basic Theory, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (License No. SCXX (Beijing) 2021-0006). The animals were maintained under controlled environmental conditions (temperature 20–24 °C, humidity 40–60%, 12-hour light/dark cycle, with adequate ventilation, standardized feed, and ad libitum water). The hair on the sebaceous gland regions of both sides of the abdomen was removed prior to experimentation. The experimental group received subcutaneous injections of a CDCA injection solution in the right-side sebaceous gland region, prepared per 2 mL as follows: 2 mg CDCA, 18 mg benzyl alcohol, 2.84 mg disodium hydrogen phosphate, 8.76 mg sodium chloride, 2.86 mg sodium hydroxide, and injection water, with pH adjusted to 8.3 as needed using hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. The control group was administered an equivalent volume of blank control solution. Injections were given daily for six consecutive days, and data were recorded at various time points.
      
      
        Dermatoscopic data acquisition
        Following induction of anesthesia with isoflurane, the dorsal hair of the golden hamsters was removed using depilatory cream and thoroughly washed with physiological saline. Once the skin was dry, a medical electronic dermatoscope (CH-DSIS-2000, Chuanghong Medical Technology, China) equipped with a 20× lens was placed in close contact with the skin. The focus was adjusted until a clear image of the sebaceous gland region was obtained, and parameters such as gland size and pigment deposition were recorded.
      
      
        Oil red O staining
        Frozen Sect. (10 μm thick) of the sebaceous gland region were prepared and fixed in 10% formalin for 30 min. Sections were then rinsed twice with distilled water (3 min each), treated with 60% isopropanol for 20–30 s, and stained with an improved Oil Red O staining kit (G1261, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) for 10–15 min. After brief differentiation with 60% isopropanol (5–10 s) and a distilled water rinse (1 min), Mayer’s hematoxylin was applied for 1–2 min. The sections were then washed, air-dried, and mounted with glycerol gelatin. Lipid droplets appeared in shades of orange-red, while nuclei were stained blue.
      
      
        Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining
        Paraffin Sect. (4 μm thick) were deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to staining with an HE staining kit (G1120, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China). Sections were stained with hematoxylin for 2 min, rinsed under running water for 10 min to achieve “blueing,” briefly differentiated with an acidic solution for 10 s, and subsequently stained with eosin for 20 s. After thorough rinsing, the slides were dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and mounted with neutral gum for optical microscopy image acquisition.
      
      
        Immunofluorescence staining
        Frozen Sect. (10 μm thick) from the sebaceous gland region were equilibrated to room temperature and washed three times with PBS (3 min per wash). After blocking with 5% goat serum at room temperature for 1 h to prevent nonspecific binding, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against Ki67 (dilution 1:200) and Cytokeratin 5 (K5, dilution 1:200) (27309-1-AP and 66727-1-Ig, respectively, from Proteintech, Wuhan, China). The following day, sections were washed three times with PBS, incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody (1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h, and finally mounted with DAPI-containing fluorescence mounting medium. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence imaging was performed using a touchscreen microscope (RVL2-K2, Echo Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA) with high-resolution objectives (4x–100x oil) and multi-wavelength LED excitation. Standard fluorophore filter sets (e.g., DAPI, FITC, TRITC, Cy5) were used, and images were captured with a 5 MP CMOS camera (2448 × 2048 pixels). Acquisition and processing were controlled via Revolve software, enabling automated exposure, focus, and filter selection.Image analysis was performed on three independent biological replicates. For each replicate, four images were captured under consistent exposure settings. Two images were averaged to generate one data point, resulting in six statistical values per group (n = 6). This design ensures both data representativeness and statistical reliability.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        All images were analyzed using ImageJ software (Version 1.8.0, NIH) with standardized protocols. Immunofluorescence intensity was quantified by threshold-based methods (auto-threshold algorithm combined with negative control calibration) to calculate integrated density. Oil Red O staining was processed via RGB color thresholding (Hue 0–30, Saturation 50–255) to determine lipid droplet-positive area percentage (%Area). Prior to analysis, uniform background subtraction and region of interest (ROI) delineation were performed.
        Data were statistically evaluated using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Initial tests for normality (Shapiro–Wilk) and homogeneity of variances (Levene’s test) were performed; if assumptions were violated, non-parametric tests or variance adjustments were applied. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni or Tukey post hoc tests for multiple comparisons. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

        Regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism in RM-1 cells
        
          Effects of different bile acids on RM‑1 cell viability and LA-induced lipid accumulation: CDCA’s potent inhibitory effect and concentration advantage
          To systematically evaluate the effects of bile acids on RM-1 cell viability, the concentration-gradient responses of CA, DCA, UDCA, and CDCA were analyzed using CCK-8 assays (Fig. 1A–D). The IC10, IC15, and IC20 concentrations were selected from SPSS-predicted inhibition ranges (IC10-IC25) to enable pharmacological comparisons under equivalent inhibition conditions while maintaining > 80% cell viability for physiologically relevant lipid metabolism studies. As shown in Fig. 1A-D, all bile acids exhibited clear concentration-dependent inhibitory effects, with CDCA demonstrating the strongest potency, as evidenced by its significantly lower IC10 concentration (0.05 µmol/L) compared to other compounds (P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Notably, statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed between high-concentration groups (IC20) and 0 µmol/L controls.

Schematic illustration of lipid accumulation in RM-1 cells stimulated with 0.1 mmol/L linoleic acid (LA); F.

Nile Red staining of RM-1 cells co-treated with LA and each bile acid at IC₁₀, IC₁₅, and IC₂₀ concentrations for 24 h: CDCA (G), CA (H), DCA (I), and UDCA (J), nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), and lipids with Nile Red (red), scale bar = 50 μm; K. Quantification of Nile Red fluorescence intensity (n = 6). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001)

          To assess the combined effects of bile acids and linoleic acid (LA, 0.1 mmol/L), the ability of each bile acid to suppress LA-induced lipid accumulation at IC₁₀/IC₁₅/IC₂₀ concentrations was further assessed (Fig. 1E–K). Nile red staining revealed that CDCA and UDCA exhibited markedly stronger lipid-suppressive effects than CA and DCA. Strikingly, CDCA exhibited a 52-fold greater potency than UDCA, achieving comparable lipid suppression at a significantly lower IC₁₀ concentration (0.05 µmol/L vs. 2.6 µmol/L). Given its superior concentration-efficacy profile and robust lipid-modulatory capacity, CDCA was prioritized for subsequent mechanistic investigations.
        
        
          Multiple regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential, and androgen receptor (AR) expression in RM-1 cells
          As illustrated in Fig. 2, CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation induced by linoleic acid (LA, 0.1 mmol/L) in RM-1 cells (Figs. 2A–B). Quantitative analysis of Nile red fluorescence intensity revealed a marked reduction in lipid accumulation in the CDCA-treated group compared to the LA group. Magnified images further demonstrated that CDCA alleviated localized intracellular lipid droplet aggregation (Fig. 2C).

Nile Red staining of RM-1 cells co-treated with DHT and CDCA (IC10-IC20); M. Quantitative analysis of Nile Red fluorescence intensity (n = 6). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001)

          Given the close relationship between lipid synthesis and mitochondrial energy metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was assessed using JC-10 staining (Figs. 2D–E). LA stimulation significantly increased ΔΨm, indicated by enhanced red fluorescence and diminished green fluorescence, suggesting elevated energy metabolism. In contrast, CDCA treatment significantly reduced the elevated ΔΨm induced by LA, bringing it closer to baseline levels observed in untreated cells. Quantitative analysis of the JC-10 red-to-green fluorescence ratio confirmed that CDCA-treated cells exhibited significantly lower ΔΨm than LA-stimulated cells.
          Although CDCA simultaneously suppressed lipid accumulation and modulated ΔΨm, the causal relationship between these effects remains to be elucidated. LA-induced lipid synthesis may elevate energy demands, thereby augmenting ΔΨm. However, CDCA’s inhibitory effects extend beyond lipid synthesis suppression and may involve indirect mechanisms, such as modulating fatty acid metabolism or mitochondrial function, to influence ΔΨm. Thus, the interplay between reduced lipid synthesis and ΔΨm attenuation likely involves a complex regulatory network requiring further investigation.
          Furthermore, considering the close interplay between lipid metabolism and hormonal signaling in prostate cancer, AR overexpression in RM-1 cells was induced using DHT. After 48 h of DHT stimulation, both AR expression and lipid accumulation were significantly elevated (Figs. 2G–H). Additionally, CCK-8 proliferation assays demonstrated that DHT not only enhanced lipid accumulation but also increased cellular viability (Fig. 2F).
          Importantly, co-treatment with CDCA and DHT substantially reduced DHT-induced AR upregulation (Figs. 2I–K). These findings suggest that CDCA may regulate lipid synthesis and metabolism by modulating androgen signaling through AR suppression. This mechanistic insight underscores CDCA’s potential therapeutic value in lipid metabolism-related disorders, such as acne. Acne pathogenesis is closely linked to increased androgen levels and altered lipid metabolism. Elevated androgens, particularly DHT, stimulate sebaceous glands to produce excessive sebum, leading to clogged pores and promoting the growth of Cutibacterium acnes, a bacterium implicated in acne inflammation. Additionally, lipid metabolic dysfunction impairs the skin barrier and fosters an inflammatory environment conducive to acne development.
          Moreover, under 2-DHT treatment, lipid accumulation increased, while CDCA was able to suppress lipid accumulation concurrently with AR inhibition (Figs. 2L–M), further elucidating the positive correlation between AR and lipid metabolism.

          CDCA modulates lipid metabolism in RM-1 cells via regulation of fatty acid and energy metabolic pathways
          RNA sequencing analysis revealed that co-treatment with CDCA and LA significantly altered gene expression profiles in RM-1 cells (Fig. 3A). Compared to the LA-treated group, the CDCA + LA group exhibited 72 upregulated and 57 downregulated genes (Fig. 3C). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predominantly associated with lipid and fatty acid metabolism-related pathways (Fig. 3D). Notably, the enrichment of the fatty acid metabolism pathway underscores CDCA’s pivotal role in regulating fatty acid synthesis, degradation, and metabolic homeostasis. Additionally, the enrichment of TGF-β and FoxO signaling pathways suggests that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism through indirect mechanisms. The involvement of the GnRH signaling pathway further implies that CDCA could modulate fatty acid metabolism via endocrine regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, pathways related to energy metabolism, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, were enriched, suggesting a potential link between CDCA treatment and alterations in cellular energy homeostasis. Furthermore, the enrichment of pathways like amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism suggests potential interactions between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the regulation of fatty acids.

Statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA compared to the LA group. Significance indicators: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001

          Further KEGG enrichment analysis focused on lipid metabolism-related pathways (Fig. 3E). The results demonstrated significant enrichment in pathways including fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid degradation, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and bile acid biosynthesis. Energy metabolism-related pathways, such as the AMPK signaling pathway and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, were also closely associated with lipid metabolism. Sankey diagram analysis identified key genes involved in these differential pathways, including aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 family member (ALDH2), acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain (ACADVL), carbonyl reductase 4 (CBR4), hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 4 (HSD17B4), and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 2 (PCSK2) (Fig. 3F). Specifically, ACADVL and HSD17B4, involved in fatty acid metabolism and degradation pathways, suggest that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism by regulating the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. CBR4, associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, further emphasizes CDCA’s role in regulating fatty acid composition. Additionally, genes related to cholesterol metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis, such as ALDH2, indicate that CDCA may indirectly participate in the regulation of lipid homeostasis by affecting cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.
          Building upon RNA-Seq analyses and previous experimental findings, the regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid and fatty acid metabolism were further investigated. Key genes associated with lipid synthesis include SREBF1 and Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC), while genes pivotal in fatty acid metabolism encompass FASN and Fatty Acid Desaturases 1–3 (FADS1-3). The mRNA expression levels of these critical factors were assessed (Fig. 3G–L), and CDCA was found to significantly downregulate their expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis further confirmed the downregulation of lipid metabolism-related proteins, including FASN, SREBF1, and FADS2, upon CDCA treatment (Fig. 3M). Collectively, these findings suggest that CDCA modulates lipid metabolism by downregulating the expression of genes and proteins involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism, highlighting its potential application in regulating lipid metabolic processes.

          Regulation of sebaceous gland activity and lipid accumulation by CDCA in golden hamsters
          To elucidate the mechanisms underlying CDCA’s effects on lipid metabolism, this study utilized golden hamsters—an animal model characterized by a well-developed sebaceous gland system. Upon intradermal injection of CDCA into the sebaceous gland region, dermoscopic examination revealed a slight, non-significant reduction in the area of this region, accompanied by mild local inflammation and decreased melanin deposition (Fig. 4A). Oil Red O staining indicated that CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation in the sebaceous gland area, indicating its regulatory role in lipid metabolism (Fig. 4B–C). Further histological analysis through Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining showed no significant morphological changes in sebaceous gland tissue structure, suggesting that CDCA does not cause structural damage to the glands; however, a noticeable reduction in gland size was observed (Fig. 4D–E). Immunofluorescence staining revealed a significant decrease in Ki67 expression in peripheral sebaceous gland cells, indicating reduced cellular activity (Fig. 4G). Additionally, the expression levels of AR and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), both closely associated with lipid metabolism, were diminished following CDCA treatment. This finding aligns with observations in RM-1 cells, where CDCA not only regulates lipid metabolism but also affects AR expression. These results suggest that CDCA may modulate sebaceous

        In summary, the study demonstrates that CDCA regulates sebaceous gland homeostasis by reducing lipid accumulation and cellular activity, potentially through the modulation of AR and PPAR-γ. Importantly, this effect occurs without disrupting the overall glandular structure, providing a theoretical basis for the application of CDCA in treating sebaceous gland-related disorders.
        
          Regulation of fatty acid composition and lipid accumulation by CDCA in primary sebaceous gland cells
          Building upon previous in vivo findings demonstrating that CDCA inhibits lipid accumulation and AR expression in the sebaceous glands of golden hamsters, its effects on sebaceous gland cells were further investigated using a primary sebaceous gland cell model.
          Lipidomic analysis (Fig. 5A) revealed that CDCA treatment significantly altered the fatty acid composition in primary sebaceous gland cells, including increased levels of various unsaturated fatty acids (such as linoleic acid and arachidonic acid) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, while decreasing certain saturated fatty acids (like palmitic acid). These changes suggest that CDCA optimizes the fatty acid profile by enhancing anti-inflammatory fatty acids (e.g., linoleic acid, which promotes skin barrier repair) and reducing pro-inflammatory saturated fatty acids.

Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA versus control group: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001

          Further Deep DIA proteomic analysis (Fig. 5B) unveiled the regulatory mechanisms of CDCA. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that CDCA modulates pathways related to fatty acid metabolism and degradation, including β-oxidation and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, CDCA significantly impacts mitochondrial function-related pathways (such as ATP synthesis and mitochondrial metabolism), implying its influence on lipid metabolism through mitochondrial energy regulation.
          A CCK-8 assay identified a non-toxic concentration of CDCA for primary sebaceous gland cells (25 µmol/L) (Fig. 5C). Nile Red staining (Fig. 5E and G) further confirmed that CDCA inhibits lipid accumulation in primary sebaceous gland cells. Under linoleic acid (0.0125 mmol/L) stimulation, CDCA significantly suppressed lipid accumulation, demonstrating its direct regulatory effect on sebocyte lipid metabolism.
          CDCA reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in primary sebaceous gland cells, mirroring the effects observed in RM-1 cells. Moreover, considering the association between lipid accumulation and androgens, CDCA decreased AR expression and lipid accumulation induced by 2-DHT (Fig. 5H–K), aligning with effects observed in RM-1 cells.
          In summary, CDCA regulates sebaceous lipid metabolism through multiple mechanisms, including altering fatty acid composition, modulating metabolic pathways, affecting mitochondrial function, and concurrently regulating AR expression. These findings underscore CDCA’s pivotal role in lipid metabolism regulation and its potential therapeutic value in treating lipid metabolism-related disorders.
        
      
    
    
      Discussion
      Lipid metabolism plays a central role in maintaining essential physiological processes such as cellular function, energy balance, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism not only affects normal physiological functions but is also closely associated with the onset and progression of various diseases [11, 21, 22]. Recent studies have demonstrated that CDCA, a primary active component of bear bile, exhibits significant potential in regulating lipid metabolic disorders [20]. This study further investigated the role of CDCA in lipid metabolism regulation. The effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism were systematically examined using various cell models, including RM-1 cells, primary sebaceous gland cells, and in vivo experiments targeting the sebaceous gland area of golden hamsters. The results indicated that CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation across these different cell and animal models, primarily by modulating fatty acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
      Initially, CDCA’s regulatory effects on lipids were validated using two cell lines. In RM-1 cells, CDCA significantly inhibited LA-induced lipid accumulation, exhibiting noticeable effects even at lower concentrations (IC10, 0.05 µmol/L), outperforming other bile acids such as UDCA. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that CDCA’s impact on RM-1 lipid metabolism was primarily focused on the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and energy metabolism. PCR and Western blot results indicate that CDCA significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of key genes such as SREBF1, ACC, FASN, FADS1-3, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). Inhibition of ACC and FASN directly affected de novo fatty acid synthesis, while downregulation of FADS and SCD1 might have reduced the production of unsaturated fatty acids, thereby influencing the composition of intracellular fatty acids. In primary sebaceous gland cells, lipidomics analysis further confirmed CDCA’s regulatory effects on fatty acid composition [23–25]. CDCA treatment significantly upregulated the content of various unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., LA, arachidonic acid) while inhibiting the expression of certain saturated fatty acids (e.g., palmitic acid). This regulation not only optimizes fatty acid composition but may also improve skin condition by increasing the proportion of anti-inflammatory fatty acids (e.g., LA).
      This study revealed the regulatory effects of CDCA on fatty acid metabolism and, for the first time, systematically explored its impact on energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. In RM-1 cells, a significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was observed following CDCA treatment, suggesting that CDCA might have influenced the cellular energy metabolic state by regulating mitochondrial function. RNA-Seq analysis further supported this view, showing significant changes in energy metabolism-related pathways such as ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling after CDCA treatment. This aligns with recent research published in Nano Letters, which demonstrated that CDCA-loaded nanoparticles can reduce adipocyte size by inducing mitochondrial functions, including promoting β-oxidation [26]. Proteomic results from primary sebaceous gland cells also confirmed this conclusion, indicating that CDCA not only affects fatty acid metabolism but also significantly regulates processes related to mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation. This consistent effect across different cell types suggests that CDCA may influence energy metabolism and mitochondrial function through a universal mechanism, thereby regulating fatty acid metabolism and balance. Additionally, studies by Liu J et al. have shown that CDCA may promote lipid peroxidation by activating the ROS/p38 MAPK/DGAT1 axis and can directly bind to mitochondria, inducing mitochondrial changes in AML cells, including swelling and cristae reduction [27]. These findings complement previous discoveries and collectively reveal the multifaceted role of CDCA in regulating energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.
      Through RNA-Seq and proteomic analyses, several signaling pathways potentially involved in CDCA’s mechanism of action were identified. The AMPK signaling pathway was likely a key mechanism by which CDCA regulates lipid metabolism. Additionally, changes in TGF-β and FoxO signaling pathways suggested that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism by regulating cell differentiation and metabolism. Notably, CDCA’s impact on the GnRH signaling pathway was also observed, which may explain its regulatory effects on hormone-related lipid metabolism. In the experimental validation section, RM-1 cells were stimulated with DHT to induce AR overexpression, and CDCA was found to reduce AR expression as well. This indicates that CDCA can regulate hormone expression while modulating lipids, further confirming the close relationship between abnormal lipid accumulation and hormone levels.
      Comprehensive results indicated that CDCA exhibited bidirectional regulation of fatty acid metabolism. On one hand, it inhibits fatty acid synthesis by downregulating genes such as SREBF1 and ACC. On the other hand, Deep DIA analysis suggests that CDCA might promote fatty acid degradation by activating β-oxidation phosphorylation-related pathways. This bidirectional regulatory mechanism enabled CDCA to more precisely balance intracellular fatty acid levels; moreover, it can optimize fatty acid composition, providing a theoretical basis for its potential application in diseases related to lipid metabolic disorders.
      Based on the research findings and existing literature, CDCA emerged as a versatile regulator of lipid metabolism with promising therapeutic applications. In skin-related lipid metabolism disorders, CDCA may hold potential value in the treatment of acne and seborrheic alopecia. Observations in primary sebaceous gland cells indicate that CDCA suppresses lipid accumulation and optimizes fatty acid composition, providing direct evidence for its potential application in these conditions. By reducing sebum accumulation and increasing the proportion of anti-inflammatory fatty acids, CDCA may help alleviate acne symptoms [7, 28]. In the context of seborrheic alopecia, CDCA’s regulation of sebaceous gland activity could assist in controlling excessive oil accumulation. In diseases associated with lipid metabolism abnormalities, such as prostate cancer, CDCA’s potential role warrants attention. CDCA exhibited inhibitory effects on lipid metabolism and modulated AR expression in RM-1 prostate cancer cells, providing novel insights into its therapeutic potential for prostate cancer. CDCA may inhibit tumor cell growth and metastasis by modulating lipid metabolism and hormone signaling pathways [29–31].
      In summary, CDCA’s consistent effects across various cell models, its comprehensive regulation of lipid metabolism, and its impact on energy metabolism and mitochondrial function laid the foundation for its potential application in the treatment of multiple diseases. Future research should further explore CDCA’s mechanisms of action, optimize administration methods, and conduct preclinical and clinical studies to fully harness its potential in treating lipid metabolism-related diseases.
      
        Study strengths and limitations
        This study offers several important strengths. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics, a comprehensive and multi-layered understanding of how CDCA regulates lipid metabolism was established. This integrative approach was applied across RM-1 prostate cancer cells, primary sebaceous gland cells, and in vivo golden hamster models, ensuring both mechanistic depth and translational relevance. Notably, CDCA exhibited a bidirectional regulatory pattern—suppressing de novo fatty acid synthesis through SREBF1, ACC, and FASN, while simultaneously promoting fatty acid degradation pathways such as β-oxidation. The study also uncovered a previously underappreciated role of CDCA in mitochondrial regulation and energy metabolism, supported by consistent findings across multiple datasets and functional assays. Furthermore, the dual applicability of CDCA in both dermatological (acne and seborrheic disorders) and oncological (prostate cancer) settings broadens its therapeutic significance and opens up possibilities for cross-disciplinary interventions.
        Despite these contributions, several limitations should be acknowledged. The study did not clarify whether CDCA’s effects are mediated through canonical bile acid receptors such as FXR or TGR5, which could provide more targeted mechanistic insight. Although key signaling pathways like AMPK and MAPK were highlighted in the omics data, their involvement was not directly confirmed using pharmacological or genetic methods. Additionally, the in vivo validation was limited to the sebaceous gland model, while findings related to prostate cancer were based solely on in vitro assays, thus limiting their immediate clinical translation. Lastly, although CDCA is already used clinically, its long-term safety and toxicity profile, particularly in the context of topical or dermatological applications, remained to be evaluated. Future studies focusing on receptor mechanisms, pathway validation, and formulation safety will be essential to fully translate CDCA into therapeutic use.
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      CDCA demonstrates potential in modulating lipid metabolism by reducing lipid accumulation and reshaping fatty acid composition in RM-1 prostate cancer cells and sebaceous gland cells. It also influences mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, with in vivo validation confirming its regulatory effect on sebaceous gland homeostasis. These findings provide a foundation for developing novel, mechanism-based interventions to address sebaceous and metabolic disorders in a more targeted and sustainable manner. Further studies are warranted to optimize delivery strategies and comprehensively assess the safety and translational potential of CDCA for long-term therapeutic use.

Title: High-frequency ultrasound in the diagnosis of Hidradenitis suppurativa: experience from the Bulgarian HS Expert Centre

Abstract: IntroductionHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an immune-mediated, autoinflammatory skin disease with different clinical manifestations. Traditional clinical examination may not assess HS true extent, while high-frequency ultrasound can detect subclinical lesions, influencing severity assessments.AimTo compare the clinical severity of HS with the ultrasonography-based staging, and explore relationships between demographic data, risk factors and clinical phenotypes.Material and methodsAn ongoing pilot study included 98 patients of the Bulgarian HS Expert Centre. Informed consent and epidemiological data were collected. Patients were categorized into disease duration groups (short/long) and classified by phenotype. Clinical severity was assessed through Hurley, IHS4, and HS-PGA staging systems and by ultrasound using SOS-HS, US IHS4, and US HS-PGA scales.ResultsThe study cohort was predominately male (74.5%) with a mean age of 36.69 years, average disease duration of 7.6 years and prevalence of the regular phenotype (53%). Age and disease duration correlated with Hurley stage (p < 0.05), but not with SOS-HS severity. Comorbidities correlated with disease duration (r = 0.256, p = 0.01), and the follicular-furunculous phenotype was associated with the females (p = 0.04). Clinical and ultrasound assessments showed strong correlations, although ultrasound showed higher severity scores (r = 0.42 to 0.92, p < 0.05), as well as significant differences across the phenotypes.ConclusionsHS is often underestimated due to delayed diagnosis and atypical presentations. Combining clinical and ultrasound assessments can provide more accurate staging. A multidisciplinary approach in expert centres can enhance diagnosis, treatment and monitoring.

Body: Introduction
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an immune-mediated, autoinflammatory skin disease that primarily affects the pilosebaceous follicles and has various clinical manifestations [1]. Determination of the clinical phenotype is important for treatment selection. Multiple phenotypic classifications further refine the understanding of HS, enabling more individualized approaches [2]. Traditional clinical examination may be limited in assessing the full extent of HS lesions, specifically in detecting subclinical lesions. Additional diagnostic modalities improve the evaluation of the disease. High-frequency ultrasound is a non-invasive diagnostic tool that provides detailed visualization of the skin and subcutaneous structures, allowing for the detection of early changes which can influence the disease severity assessments and guide treatment decisions. By offering real-time visualization it can be useful in preoperative mapping, in monitoring disease progression and treatment response [3].
    
    
      Aim
      The aim of the study was to compare the clinical severity stage of HS with the ultrasonography-based staging and to explore the relationships between demographic data, risk factors and clinical phenotypes.
    
    
      Material and methods
      An ongoing pilot study started in 2022, has included 98 inpatients and outpatients of the Bulgarian HS Expert Centre within the Dermatology Clinic of University Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment “Prof. Dr. Stoyan Kirkovich”, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria. Participants were selected based on their willingness to undergo clinical and ultrasound evaluations. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before their inclusion in the study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Trakia University and the University Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment “Prof. Dr. Stoyan Kirkovich” in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000. A detailed epidemiological study collected data on gender, age, duration of the symptoms, smoking and comorbidities. To assess the duration of HS symptoms, patients were categorised into two groups: short disease duration (SDD, ≤ 5 years) and long disease duration (LDD, > 5 years). Patients were categorised according to the phenotypic classification of Van der Zee and Jemec [4], modified by the Bulgarian HS Expert Centre into regular, follicular, anogenital/sacrogluteal, conglobate, elephantiasis nostra- like, PG-like, cutis verticis gyrata-like, syndromic and mixed phenotype (Table 1). Clinical assessment of the severity of HS was performed using the clinical Hurley staging system, International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Scoring System (IHS4) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa Physician’s Global Assessment scale (HS-PGA). Ultrasound evaluation was done using the ultrasound device MyLab Sigma equipped with a 22 MHz linear probe applying the SOS-HS and ultrasound-based US IHS4 and US HS-PGA staging systems.

Statistical significance was determined by calculating p-values (p < 0.05).
      
    
    
      Results
      A total of 98 patients were included in the study. Detailed information on demographics, comorbidities, and clinical phenotypes distribution is summarized in Table 2. The age of the cohort had a normal distribution (p = 0.161 for Kolmogorov-Smirnov and p = 0.137 for Shapiro-Wilk). The mean age was 36.69 years (95% CI: 34.31, 39.07). A predominance of males (73/98, 74.5%) was observed. The mean duration of symptoms was 7.6 years (95% CI: 6.44, 8.88). The disease duration did not follow a normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov, p < 0.001 and Shapiro-Wilk, p < 0.001). The distribution of patients by duration within the groups was 48/98 (49.0%) patients in SDD and 50/98 (51.0%) patients in the LDD group. The most common HS phenotype in the cohort was the regular (53/98, 53%), followed by the mixed (20/98, 22%) and follicular (13/98, 13%) phenotype (Table 3). Assessment of the HS severity using the Hurley staging system showed that most of the patients were in Stage II (58/98, 59%), while the ultrasound SOS-HS showed a prevalence of Stage III (76/98, 78%) (Table 4).

      No statistically significant association was found between gender and disease severity, defined clinically by the Hurley staging system (c2 = 1.506, p = 0.471) and by ultrasound SOS-HS severity (χ2 = 0.046, p = 0.829). The multinomial logistic regression between gender and the clinical HS phenotypes showed no statistically significant association except between the female gender and follicular phenotype of HS (Coef 1.278, p = 0.046, 95% CI: 1.021, 12.620). A positive correlation between age and disease severity according to Hurley stage (r = 0.228, p = 0.024) was established, indicating that higher stages are associated with increasing age. Ordinal regression analysis further confirmed that age significantly impacts disease severity (χ2 = 71.418, R2 = 0.625, p = 0.003). Correlation between age and SOS-HS severity (r = 0.041, p = 0.688) was not found, as well as by ordinal regression analysis (χ2 = 41.577, R2 = 0.528, p = 0.489). No statistically significant association was found between smoking and disease severity, assessed clinically using the Hurley staging system (χ2 = 1.097, p = 0.895) or by ultrasound using the SOS-HS scale. Disease duration was significantly associated with HS severity as assessed by the Hurley stage (χ2 = 7.656, p = 0.022), with a trend noted (χ2 = 6.981, p = 0.008) and confirmed by ordinal regression (PLUM) (χ2 = 6.739, p = 0.009), showing higher severity in those with longer duration (Estimate = –1.078, p = 0.011). No significant association was found when the severity was assessed by ultrasound SOS-HS scale (χ2 = 1.149, p = 0.284), ordinal regression (χ2 = 1.165, p = 0.280). In 54 of the total 98 (55%) patients one or more concomitant diseases were registered (Table 2). The distribution of patients by the duration of complaints and total number of comorbidities was as follows: 48/98 (49.0%) with duration of the complaints in the SDD group had a total of 24 registered comorbidities (M = 0.50, SD = 0.684), while 50/98 (51.0%) in the LDD had 43 comorbidities (M = 0.86, SD = 0.783). The Mann-Whitney U test (U = 878.5, Z = –2.517, p = 0.012) showed significant differences between the groups. The duration of complaints and the number of comorbidities were positively correlated (r = 0.256, p = 0.011).
      The comparison between clinical and ultrasound severity HS assessments showed statistically significant differences (Figure 1). The ultrasound assessments generally provided higher disease severity compared to clinical evaluation on all scales. The clinical Hurley staging vs. ultrasound SOS-HS showed a significant difference in severity assessments (Wilcoxon Z = –6.814, p < 0.05). Spearman’s correlation demonstrated a positive relationship between the two scales (r = 0.426, p = 0.0001). When we compared the clinical IHS4 vs. ultrasound US IHS4 a significant difference in the two methods was also observed (Wilcoxon Z = –4.025, p < 0.05). Spearman’s correlation revealed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.805, p < 0.05). When comparing the clinical IHS4 severity in points with the US IHS4, the ultrasound points demonstrated significantly higher severity (Wilcoxon Z = –7.066, p < 0.05), with a strong positive correlation between the assessments (r = 0.922, p < 0.05). For the clinical HS-PGA vs. ultrasound US HS-PGA, there was a statistically significant difference (Wilcoxon Z = –4.782, p < 0.05), and the two scales were strongly positively correlated with each other (r = 0.813, p < 0.05).

      Comparative analysis between the different phenotypes and clinical and ultrasonographic stages was performed exploring the correlations and differences in scoring systems and assessment methods. For the regular phenotype, significant associations were found between Hurley score and SOS-HS (p < 0.01, r = 0.680), as well as between the IHS4 and US IHS4 (p < 0.01, r = 0.907) and between HS-PGA and US HS-PGA (p < 0.01, r = 0.853). Wilcoxon test showed statistically significant differences between Hurley and SOS-HS (p = 0.008, Z = –2.646), IHS4 and US IHS4 (p = 0.046, Z = –2.000), HS-PGA and US HS-PGA (p = 0.004, Z = –2.889). In patients with follicular phenotype, no significant correlation between Hurley and SOS-HS assessment was determined (r = 0.501, p = 0.081) but a difference was noted (p = 0.002, Z = –3.127). In contrast, correlations between IHS4 and US IHS4 were found (r = 0.853, p < 0.01) as well as between HS-PGA and US HS-PGA (r = 0.707, p < 0.01). For the anogenital phenotype, there were significant correlations between IHS4 and US IHS4 (r = 0.776, p < 0.05), and between HS-PGA and US HS-PGA (r = 0.919, p < 0.01). However, no correlation was found between Hurley and HS-SOS (p = 1.000). No significant correlations or differences were found for the conglobate, elephantiasis nostra-like, PG-like, and syndromic phenotypes due to the small number of patients included in these groups and the rarity of phenotypes. Within the mixed phenotype, notable correlations were seen between Hurley and SOS-HS (r = 0.669, p < 0.01), IHS4 and US IHS4 (r = 0.897, p < 0.01), and HS-PGA and US HS-PGA (r = 0.768, p < 0.01). Significant differences were also noted between Hurley and SOS-HS (p = 0.008, Z = –2.646) and US IHS4 and IHS4 (p = 0.046, Z = –2.000).
    
    
      Discussion
      Our study revealed a male predominance (74.5%) and the mean age of 36.69 years coinciding with reported data that HS typically affects people in their thirties and forties [5]. The mean duration of HS symptoms was 7.6 years, and up to 30 years in some cases. The results are similar to those from our previous study which reported a male predominance (60.4%), a mean age of 32 years, and average symptom duration of 8 years [6]. Our findings align with the reported average diagnostic delay of 10.1 years among 285 patients in a recent study by Aparício Martins et al. [7]. This is probably due to misdiagnosis, the chronic nature of the disease, atypical clinical manifestations and comorbidities. Further, we classified our patients into two groups (SDD: < 5 years and LDD: > 5 years) to investigate the impact of disease duration. This classification was inspired by approaches used in other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as psoriasis, where categorizing patients by disease duration (e.g. SDD: ≤ 2 years and LDD: > 2 years) highlights the benefits of early treatment and its influence on long-term outcomes [8]. In HS, the 5-year cutoff was used in a 2020 study by Marzano et al., which showed that patients with disease duration exceeding 5 years had higher severity scores and HIDRAdisk score compared to those with a shorter disease duration (< 5 years) [9]. More recently, Aparício Martins et al. also applied the same 5-year threshold, demonstrating that delays in diagnosis beyond this period are significantly associated with more severe disease, systemic comorbidities, and poorer outcomes [7]. Real-world data further support the notion that earlier treatment improves outcomes and reduces disease burden [10]. Based on this, we suggest that the 5-year cutoff represents a “window of opportunity” in HS, during which diagnosis and treatment can prevent progression of the disease and optimize the long-term outcomes. This framework may offer a useful way to distinguish between potentially modifiable early-stage disease and more advanced cases. A significant association was found between the female gender and the follicular phenotype and this finding is confirmed by a study of Moata et al. [11]. Follicular lesions observed in the earlier stages of HS may be more common in women as they seek medical care before the disease progresses. Smoking has been established as a major risk factor associated with the pathogenesis of the disease. Results of our cohort found a high percentage of smokers – 61% (60/98) with male predominance (68.3%) and are similar to the cohort study performed by Yüksel and Basım in Turkey which reported that 60.6% (126/208) of their patients were smokers, again with male predominance (74.5%) [12].
      In terms of clinical phenotypes, our study found the regular phenotype to be most prevalent followed by the follicular phenotype, completely in line with the literature data [13]. Some rare phenotypes including recently described PG-like, elephantiasis nostra-like and SAPHOSH syndrome (synovitis, acne-pustulosis, hyperostosis, osteitis, suppurative hidradenitis-HS) were recently reported by our team [14, 15], which prompted us to suggest a modification of the Van der Zee and Jemec classification for more accurate categorization of atypical disease presentations [16]. Comparison between clinical Hurley and SOS-HS assessments showed a significant difference in which the ultrasound-based scale demonstrated higher disease severity than the clinical assessment. This is consistent with the findings of Nazzaro et al. that ultrasonography is more sensitive to detecting higher disease severity as compared to the clinical staging alone (k = 0.477). We also found a significant difference between clinical HS-PGA and US HS-PGA scores (3.97 vs. 4.33), once again showing more severe disease staging with ultrasonography which aligns with the data reported by Lacarrubba et al. (2.70 vs. 2.92), and in other studies [17, 18]. Further results from a comparison between clinical IHS4 and equivalent ultrasound IHS4 scoring systems revealed a statistically significant difference with higher disease severity using ultrasonography. To our knowledge, the use of ultrasound-based IHS4 to assess severity has not been previously reported. These findings support our assertion that ultrasound provides a more comprehensive evaluation of disease severity than clinical assessment alone. No statistically significant relationship between gender and disease severity assessed by the Hurley staging system or SOS-HS was found. These data are not in line with other studies that show increased disease severity in males [19], but this may be due to regional differences and age.
      A comparison between the age and disease severity using the Hurley stage showed a positive correlation, which is generally in line with other studies indicating that older patients have more severe HS [20, 21], likely due to age-associated alterations in the immune system with chronic inflammation and irreversible structural damage and chronic progressive nature of the disease. Our study established a significant association between disease duration and severity measured by the Hurley staging system. This indicates that longer disease duration is associated with greater severity, consistent with findings from other studies [22]. In our small cohort, we could not find any significant correlation between age and SOS-HS severity, nor between the duration of HS symptoms and ultrasound SOS-HS severity. The duration of the disease was significantly positively correlated with the number of comorbidities, indicating that as severity increases, the number of concomitant diseases also rises, as noted in previous studies [22]. The presence of multiple comorbidities in patients with severe HS necessitates a multidisciplinary approach at HS Expert Centres, ensuring early diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of the disease. Statistical analysis revealed no significant relationship between severity and the number of comorbidities, whether assessed by clinical Hurley staging or ultrasound SOS-HS. The lack of significance in our findings could be due to the smaller sample size and possible underreporting of comorbidities. Smoking was not significantly associated with disease severity in our cohort either in clinical assessments or by ultrasound. This finding is in agreement with some other studies [23], whereas some suggest a strong relationship between smoking and increased HS severity [24–26]. This discrepancy may be due to differences in factors such as age and regional characteristics that may influence the association between smoking and HS severity. When we compared clinical and ultrasonographic assessment across the different phenotypes, the results showed that ultrasound is a valuable tool in the evaluation of all observed phenotypes. In the regular and mixed phenotypes, all clinical scoring systems correlated well with ultrasound-based ones. In the follicular and anogenital phenotypes, we found no correlation between Hurley and SOS-HS, but IHS4 and HS-PGA strongly correlated with US-based systems. In the regular phenotype, significant differences were found between all clinical and ultrasound scoring systems. For the follicular phenotype, a significant difference was noted between Hurley and SOS-HS. In the mixed phenotype, differences were observed between Hurley and SOS-HS, and between US IHS4 and IHS4. The presence of correlations suggest that both clinical and ultrasound scoring systems are assessing the same disease parameters, while the lack of correlation may reflect differences in sensitivity, with one method detecting features of the disease missed by the other. The observed differences across the phenotypes underscore the added value of ultrasonography in capturing subclinical and deeper lesions not visible through clinical assessments.
      Overall, our results indicate that clinical IHS4 and HS-PGA, alongside their corresponding ultrasound scales (US IHS4 and US HS-PGA), provide more accurate and comprehensive disease staging than the traditional Hurley and SOS-HS staging systems, which are static and less detailed in assessing disease severity. However, ultrasound should complement clinical assessments as both clinical and ultrasound evaluations should go hand in hand to offer a more complete understanding of disease severity.
      Limitations. The limitations of the study include the small sample size, being conducted at a single centre, and the absence of a national HS register in Bulgaria. The patients from specialized centres may not be representative of the wider HS population as they might have more severe or even atypical cases.
    
    
      Conclusions
      Hidradenitis suppurativa is a condition that remains underestimated mainly due to delayed diagnosis and atypical presentations. Determining the stage and phenotype of a disease is essential for selecting the most effective treatment strategy. High-frequency ultrasound emerges as an important diagnostic tool for assessing disease severity in patients and provides sensitive information by detecting subclinical lesions. The combination of clinical with ultrasound assessment specifically using the clinical IHS4, HS-PGA along with equivalent ultrasound-based US IHS4 and US HS-PGA staging systems provides the most accurate staging. A multidisciplinary approach in HS Expert Centres may enhance the diagnosis and treatment outcomes in patients, considering the severity of the condition and its associated comorbidities. Prospective future directions of this study include examining the role of ultrasound in treatment applications, with a particular emphasis on its utility in preoperative mapping and the monitoring treatment over time.

Title: Dupilumab treatment for prurigo nodularis: a retrospective study of 76 patients

Abstract: IntroductionPrurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic pruritic and inflammatory skin disorder and dupilumab is currently the only biologic agent approved in China for the treatment.AimTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in managing moderate to severe PN through a retrospective study of 76 patients.Material and methodsA retrospective analysis was conducted of clinical and laboratory data from PN patients who received regular dupilumab treatment for 52 weeks at the Dermatology Department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between March 2021 and June 2023. Assessments were made at baseline (week 0), and at weeks 4, 8, 16, 26, and 52 using prurigo nodule counts, Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) scores, Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores to evaluate clinical symptoms and pruritus. Adverse events occurring post-treatment were also recorded to assess the drug’s safety and efficacy.ResultsA total of 76 patients with moderate to severe PN were included in this study. By week 52, there were significant reductions in prurigo nodule counts, IGA scores, NRS scores, and DLQI scores. Prurigo nodule counts decreased from a baseline of 74.64 ±33.45 to 2.3 ±0.9, IGA scores from 3.53 ±0.54 to 0.54 ±0.33, NRS scores from 7.65 ±2.27 to 1.01 ±0.65, and DLQI scores from 18.46 ±4.53 to 1.55 ±0.68, with all differences being statistically significant (p < 0.05). Seven patients experienced injection site reactions, and 2 patients developed facial erythema, which resolved either spontaneously or with symptomatic treatment. No other adverse events were reported.ConclusionsDupilumab effectively reduces the number of PN, improves IGA scores, alleviates pruritus, and enhances quality of life in patients with moderate to severe PN, with a high safety profile.

Body: Introduction
      Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic pruritic and inflammatory skin disorder characterized by symmetrically distributed, often on the extremities and occasionally on the trunk, keratotic papules and nodules accompanied by intense and unbearable itching [1]. The aetiology of PN remains unclear; however, it can be triggered by various factors including skin diseases, systemic conditions, and neuropsychological factors, with their interactions exacerbating the skin lesions [2]. Type 2 inflammatory responses are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease [3].
      The treatment options for PN are diverse, and there is no consensus on the standard treatment regimen. Therapeutic approaches include both systemic and non-systemic treatments [4]. Non-systemic therapies, considered first-line, encompass topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI), and intralesional corticosteroid injections. However, the prolonged use of TCS may lead to adverse effects such as skin atrophy, telangiectasia, acne, and folliculitis [5]. Systemic treatments include gabapentinoids, antidepressants, immunosuppressants, and biological agents such as dupilumab and nemolizumab [6]. Methotrexate [7] and thalidomide [8] have also been reported to effectively alleviate inflammation and pruritus, but their long-term use is limited by adverse effects. Dupilumab received FDA approval for PN in September 2022 and has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing pruritus and skin lesions with rare associated side effects [9]. A phase 3 clinical trial suggested that nemolizumab had good efficacy in the treatment of PN [10], and it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of PN in August 2024. However, nemolizumab has yet to obtain the approval for marketing in China.
      Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the alpha subunit of the IL-4/13 receptor. By blocking the biological activities of IL-4 and IL-13, dupilumab inhibits type 2 inflammatory responses [11]. Since IL-4 and IL-13 are implicated in the pruritic mechanisms associated with PN, dupilumab may offer therapeutic benefits for this condition. Dupilumab has been approved in China for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in patients aged 6 years and older.
    
    
      Aim
      This study retrospectively evaluates the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in managing moderate to severe PN, and the results are summarized as follows.
    
    
      Material and methods
      
        Study population
        A total of 76 patients diagnosed with moderate to severe PN and treated with dupilumab at the Dermatology Outpatient Clinic of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from March 2021 to June 2023 were included in the study. Diagnostic criteria: (1) presence of refractory nodular skin lesions; (2) pruritus duration of ≥ 6 weeks; and (3) history and/or signs of repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing. Inclusion criteria: (1) meeting the above diagnostic criteria and confirmed PN diagnosis; (2) disease severity assessed as moderate to severe by the same primary dermatologist, with Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) ≥ 3 and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ≥ 4; (3) age ≥ 18 years at the time of initial treatment; (4) history of inadequate response to traditional PN treatments; and (5) signed informed consent for dupilumab treatment and good compliance, with all patients completing the 52-week treatment. Exclusion criteria: (1) pregnant and lactating patients; (2) patients with active systemic infections such as parasitic infections, hepatitis, tuberculosis, syphilis, or HIV; (3) patients with progressive malignant tumours; (4) patients with other severe underlying diseases that could interfere with efficacy evaluation; (5) differential diagnoses such as nodular pemphigoid, skin tumours, or scabies; and (6) patients who had received systemic phototherapy, other biological agents, immunosuppressants, or small molecule drugs within 6 months before or during the treatment period.
      
      
        Treatment protocol
        Patients enrolled in the study received subcutaneous injections of dupilumab administered by trained professionals. The initial dose was 600 mg, given as two subcutaneous injections. Thereafter, 300 mg was injected every 2 weeks. After 16 weeks of treatment, the maintenance dose was adjusted based on the patient’s condition by the clinician, either continuing with 300 mg every 2 weeks or extending to 300 mg every 3–4 weeks, administered regularly. Dupilumab injection solution (Dupilumab), brand name: Dupixent®, manufactured by Sanofi, was provided in pre-filled syringes at a dosage of 300 mg (2.0 ml) per syringe, with two syringes per box.
        During the course of dupilumab treatment, patients were allowed to concurrently use oral antihistamines, topical moisturizers, TCS, and TCI.
      
      
        Study methods
        The retrospective study collected general patient information from outpatient medical records. During and after the dupilumab treatment period, follow-up phone interviews were conducted by dedicated personnel. Data on the number of nodules, IGA, NRS, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores were recorded at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 16, 26, and 52 of treatment [12]. Adverse events post-treatment were also documented.
        
          General information
          Basic information included patient name, age, gender, and visit date. Medical history data encompassed age at initial onset, duration of the disease, diagnosis and treatment history, atopic history, past medical history, and drug allergy history.
        
        
          Efficacy evaluation criteria
          IGA Score: Severity was graded based on the number of prurigo nodules: Grade 0 (no lesions, 0 nodules), Grade 1 (almost clear, 1–5 nodules), Grade 2 (mild, 6–19 nodules), Grade 3 (moderate, 20–100 nodules), and Grade 4 (severe, more than 100 nodules).
          NRS Score: Patients self-rated the intensity of the most severe itch experienced in the past 24 h on a scale of 0 to 10. A score of 0 indicated no itching, 1–3 indicated mild itching (not affecting sleep), 4–6 indicated moderate itching, 7–9 indicated severe itching (disturbing sleep), and 10 represented the worst imaginable itching.
          DLQI Score: The DLQI was used to assess the impact of the skin disease on the patient’s quality of life over the past week. It included 10 items covering symptoms such as itching, soreness, pain, stinging, embarrassment, impact on shopping and housework, choice of clothing, social and leisure activities, sports, work or study, relationships, sexual activity, and the burden of treatment. Each item was scored from 0 to 3, with a total score range of 0–30. Higher scores indicated a greater impact on quality of life: 0–1 (no effect), 2–5 (mild effect), 6–10 (moderate effect), 11–20 (large effect), and 21–30 (extremely large effect).
        
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 29.0 software. Categorical data were expressed as percentages (%). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the normality of continuous data. Normally distributed data were analysed using paired t-tests, while non-normally distributed data were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Data were described as mean ± standard deviation (SD), with a significance level set at p < 0.05.
      
    
    
      Results

      Efficacy analysis
      All patients completed the 52-week treatment. Dupilumab has shown significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe PN. During the initial 16 weeks, patients received a regular dosage of 300 mg every 2 weeks. After completing the 16-week treatment, patients with severe conditions continued with bi-weekly injections, while those with marked improvement extended the injection interval to every 3–4 weeks. There were significant reductions in the number of nodules, IGA scores, NRS scores, and DLQI scores at weeks 4, 8, 16, 26, and 52 of treatment (Table 2). These differences were statistically significant (Figure 1).

      This study meticulously documented the safety of dupilumab in treating moderate to severe PN. The primary adverse reactions observed during treatment included injection site reactions and facial erythema (Table 3). These reactions were mild in severity; injection site reactions resolved spontaneously and did not impact subsequent treatments after changing the injection site. Facial erythema was transient and improved with symptomatic treatment. Throughout the 52-week treatment period, no patients experienced serious adverse events requiring discontinuation of therapy.

      Discussion
      PN is often associated with severe pruritus and is resistant to conventional treatments. The intense itching compels patients to self-mutilate through scratching, resulting in disfigurement, depression, and significant impairment of quality of life. Patients with PN experience considerable deterioration in quality of life, with the vast majority (97.2%) trapped in an itch-scratch cycle, leading to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depressive states due to the severe and unrelenting pruritus. Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that PN is associated with Th2 inflammatory immune responses [13, 14]. Various inflammatory cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of PN, with increased expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-31 detectable in prurigo lesions [3, 15]. It is also related to neurogenic inflammation triggered by repeated scratching of the lesions. Studies have shown strong expression of p75NTR in the lesional skin of PN, indicating specific neuropathic involvement in PN. Additionally, cortistatin (CST) and substance P (SP) have been detected in the epidermis. The SP/MRGPRs pathway plays a significant role in the immune response and pruritus associated with PN [16]. There is also evidence suggesting that immune processes involving Th1, Th17, and Th22 pathways play a role in its development [2, 17]. Current evidence indicates that the JAK-STAT pathway is also involved in the pathogenesis of PN [18].
      Traditional systemic therapies for PN such as thalidomide, glucocorticoids, and immunosuppressants like cyclosporine have shown limited clinical efficacy and significant potential toxic effects. These treatments may also impose a greater health burden on elderly patients with comorbid conditions [19–22]. With the emergence of new increased expression of mRNAs for IL-4, IL-17, IL-22 and IL-31 in skin lesions of subacute and chronic forms of prurigo therapeutic targets in recent years, novel therapies have gradually been developed. These include biologics such as dupilumab, nemolizumab, tralokinumab, and lebrikizumab, as well as various small molecule agents like neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, Janus kinase inhibitors, and µ-opioid receptor antagonists/m-antagonists/k-agonists. These therapies have shown promising efficacy [23, 24]. However, except dupilumab and nemolizumab, the sample sizes for these treatments remain relatively small, and they have not yet been approved for the treatment of PN.
      Since its approval for atopic dermatitis (AD), dupilumab has been widely utilized, demonstrating clear efficacy and safety [14, 25]. PN shares certain clinical and pathophysiological features with AD, which is considered one of the most relevant disease factors for PN. This shared pathophysiology likely underlies the effectiveness of dupilumab in treating PN [3, 26, 27]. Dupilumab functions by inhibiting IL-4 signalling through binding to type I and type II receptors and IL-13 signalling through binding to type II receptors, thus blocking Th2 cell-mediated inflammatory responses. This mechanism disrupts the distinctive itch-scratch cycle in PN, leading to clinical remission [28]. Therefore, we selected dupilumab for the treatment of moderate to severe PN and aimed to evaluate its efficacy and safety in this patient population.
      We present real-world data from a 52-week follow-up study of 76 patients with PN who were treated with dupilumab at the Suzhou Hospital, China. The data indicate that dupilumab significantly improved both the clinical signs and manifestations of PN. The average age of onset for PN in our cohort was 50 years, with no significant gender differences noted, and the majority of patients had comorbid conditions.
      Our findings demonstrate a reduction in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores from a baseline of 7.65 to 6.24 at the 4-week follow-up and further to 0.54 at the 52-week follow-up. DLQI scores decreased from a baseline of 18.46 to 13.35 at the 4-week follow-up and to 1.55 at the 52-week follow-up. These results confirm the substantial efficacy of dupilumab in improving both pruritus and quality of life for PN patients.
      The NRS and DLQI scores showed more pronounced improvements in the early follow-up periods (4 weeks and 8 weeks), with subsequent, albeit less dramatic, improvements observed at the 52-week follow-up. This indicates that dupilumab has a notable impact on alleviating pruritus and enhancing quality of life in the initial treatment phase. Conversely, the IGA scores and nodule counts did not exhibit significant reduction during the first 16 weeks but demonstrated more pronounced improvement in later follow-up periods (16 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks). This suggests that dupilumab is more effective in reducing disease severity and nodule count with prolonged treatment. Thus, dupilumab is not only effective in the early stages of treatment but also maintains its therapeutic efficacy over the long term.
      Beck et al. [29] reported in 2018 on 3 cases in the United States, demonstrating that within 12 weeks of treatment with dupilumab, there was a notable reduction in pruritus symptoms, a decrease in the overall size and number of prurigo lesions, and a marked improvement in quality of life. In a retrospective study conducted in Italy by Chiricozzi et al. [30] in 2020, significant improvement in skin lesions was first observed at 4 weeks, with further amelioration in pruritus and PN lesions evident by 36 weeks. Clinical improvement was assessed via the IGA, and both pruritus and insomnia, as measured by the NRS, showed substantial reductions.
      A long-term retrospective study by Georgakopoulos et al. [31] in Canada in 2021 found that 78.9% of patients reported a subjective improvement in pruritus by 16 weeks, with 41.17% of patients demonstrating clinical symptom improvement by 52 weeks. In a 2023 real-world observational study conducted in China, Fang and Lian [32] observed that pruritus symptoms in PN patients exhibited rapid relief within 2 weeks of initiating treatment, with significant improvement in skin lesions noted at both 4 and 8 weeks. Additionally, Cao et al. [25] in a 2023 systematic review concluded that dupilumab treatment led to a significant reduction in NRS scores at weeks 4, 12, 16 and beyond 16 weeks, with at least 87.5% of PN patients achieving clinical remission. These findings are congruent with our prior clinical trial results.
      Conversely, Cunha et al. [33] reported in 2022 from Portugal that a patient exhibited a decrease in NRS scores and a reduction in nodule count only after 3 months of dupilumab treatment. This suggests that adult patients with severe, treatment-resistant chronic PN, may require an extended period to achieve therapeutic response when treated with dupilumab.
      Comparing the data from dupilumab treatment for atopic dermatitis [34–36] with for PN patients, it appears that dupilumab may require a longer duration of treatment to achieve its full therapeutic effects in PN. Unlike AD patients, those with PN experience a slower reduction in pruritus and a more gradual resolution of skin lesions.
      In a comparison of our findings with a phase III open-label extension study by Blauvelt et al. [37], it is evident that the reduction in IGA scores was significantly greater in AD patients (1.5 points) compared to PN patients (0.19 points) at the 4-week mark. In terms of VAS scores, AD patients exhibited a more substantial decrease in pruritus, reaching 5.0, whereas PN patients had a lesser initial reduction of 1.41 points. Additionally, DLQI scores indicated that AD patients experienced a more significant improvement in quality of life (4.9 points) during the early treatment phase compared to PN patients (5.11 points).
      However, in the later stages of treatment (16 weeks to 52 weeks), PN patients showed a more pronounced decrease in VAS scores, indicating more substantial relief from pruritus. Furthermore, the DLQI scores for PN patients decreased significantly in the later stages, reflecting a notable improvement in quality of life, while the improvement in AD patients was relatively gradual.
      These differences in response times may be attributable to the distinct pathological characteristics and therapeutic response mechanisms of the diseases. AD patients may exhibit a more rapid initial response to dupilumab, but as treatment progresses, the rate of improvement may plateau. In contrast, PN patients may have a slower initial response, but with continued treatment, the therapeutic effects become more evident, demonstrating more significant long-term improvements, particularly in pruritus relief and quality of life enhancement.
      In this research, adverse effects were generally mild and self-limiting, resolving either spontaneously or with symptomatic treatment. Notably, no cases of conjunctivitis – a commonly reported adverse reaction – were observed, and no patients discontinued therapy due to adverse effects, underscoring the favourable tolerability profile of dupilumab. Further investigation is warranted to characterize the nature of injection site reactions and determine their relationship with drug dosage or administration frequency. Additionally, the occurrence of facial erythema might be attributed to either local drug effects or individual skin sensitivity, necessitating further exploration of its underlying mechanisms.
      In this research, limitations are conspicuous. We adopted the method of open design with no control and a pre-post self-comparison protocol was implemented. The enrolled patients had a history of poor response to conventional PN treatments. Since we hypothesized that the probability of clinical improvement without dupilumab was relatively low based on existing evidence and clinical experience, this self-comparison approach was selected. PN is a chronic, stubborn skin disease with patients suffering from severe itching and few treatment options. For patients open to biological agents, a placebo control might lead to early treatment dropout due to lack of expected results, causing ethical and practical issues. The study was in an outpatient setting. Patient communication about condition changes made a single-blind condition unfeasible. So, an open-label retrospective study was done. Despite its limitations like inability to confirm causal links as in a randomized trial and weaker evidence, it allows data collection for future in-depth studies, and provides valuable insights for future research under better conditions.
      We allowed patients to use antihistamines and TCS, which might lead to potential biases in the final outcomes. Given that dupilumab takes time to exert its effects and there is no contraindication for concomitant medications, we did not compel patients to discontinue the use of antihistamines and TCS with less-than-ideal efficacy until the skin rashes and itching were truly alleviated.
      While the infrequent and mild nature of adverse events supports the overall safety of dupilumab, the study’s limitations include a relatively small sample size and the potential overlap between atopic dermatitis and PN. Such overlap could impact treatment efficacy as patients with AD might exhibit a more pronounced initial response to dupilumab, potentially skewing the observed rates of clinical symptom relief. Future research should address these limitations by incorporating larger sample sizes and accounting for the effects of disease overlap on treatment outcomes.
      The rates of observed clinical symptom relief may be affected by baseline patient traits, including disease duration, severity, and comorbid conditions. Thorough analyses of such baseline factors are crucial for pinpointing variables that notably influence treatment effectiveness. Moreover, patient compliance is crucial for assessing the long-term consequences of dupilumab treatment as it facilitates understanding the sustained efficacy of the drug in treating PN and ensures persistent adherence to the prescribed treatment protocol. These further analyses will provide a more comprehensive assessment of dupilumab’s efficacy, safety, and clinical relevance in the management of PN, thereby offering more robust evidence for its use in clinical practice.
    
    
      Conclusions
      Our data indicate that dupilumab is a highly effective and safe treatment option for PN. Dupilumab has shown significant benefits in reducing the number of prurigo nodules, improving IGA scores, alleviating pruritus, and enhancing the DLQI scores in patients with moderate to severe PN, while maintaining a favourable safety profile.
      Compared to atopic dermatitis, patients with PN may require a longer duration of treatment with dupilumab to achieve comparable therapeutic effects. Although the emergence of various small-molecule drugs has expanded the treatment options for PN, these alternatives often present with greater limitations or side effects.
      Currently, dupilumab stands out as a leading option for the treatment of PN due to its efficacy and safety. Future research should focus on conducting rigorous randomized controlled trials to further validate these findings. Such studies will facilitate the optimization of treatment regimens and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies tailored to individual patient profiles, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life for PN patients.

Title: Antirheumatic Medication Calendar Significantly Improves Adherence in First-Time Methotrexate Users: A Prospective, Single-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract: PurposeMethotrexate is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis; however, the adherence rate greatly varies due to its weekly dosing schedule. Incorrect administration can lead to disease progression and toxicity. To design a graphic-based medication calendar aiming to improve adherence in first-time methotrexate users.Patients and MethodsThis prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial included participants aged 18–75 years who were starting methotrexate for the first time or resuming it after a 3-month break. Seventy-nine participants from October 1, 2023, to January 30, 2024, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the calendar (38 participants) or control (41 participants) group for 6 weeks and followed up for 2, 6, and 10 weeks. The primary outcome was methotrexate adherence, assessed by the proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100%.ResultsAfter 6 and 10 weeks, the calendar group had a higher proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100% compared with the control group (97.2% vs 73.2%, P < 0.004; 88.9% vs 68.9%, P < 0.03, respectively) and a higher correct medication adherence rate within 10 weeks (87.81% vs 69%, P = 0.0307). Compared with the control group, the calendar group had a significantly higher rate of on-time return visits during both follow-up visits (97.2% vs 78.0% and 91.7% vs 70.7%, respectively). Additionally, 94.74% of the calendar group patients believed the intervention improved their adherence and wished to continue using it.ConclusionThe antirheumatic medication calendar improved initial methotrexate adherence; however, its effect diminished following its discontinuation.Clinical Trial RegistrationChiCTR2300076228 (2023–09-27).

Body: Introduction
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting approximately 1% of the global population. In China, the prevalence of RA is 0.2–0.37%.1 The main symptoms of RA include pain, joint swelling, and stiffness. Chronic inflammation caused by pathological activation of the immune system gradually destroys the bone, leading to joint deformities and disability.2 Long-term immune intervention can effectively suppress joint destruction and slow disease progression.
      In the 1960s, methotrexate was first used to treat RA and has become the first choice for RA treatment owing to its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness.3 Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist, regulates inflammatory cells in synovial membranes, inhibits the production of inflammatory factors, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects through adenosine signaling pathways.4
      However, the effectiveness of methotrexate is often limited by poor patient adherence. The typical methotrexate dose in standard RA treatment is 10–25 mg per week. Low-dose methotrexate guarantees efficacy and safety simultaneously. However, administration at a 1-week interval requires diligent patient adherence. Adherence rates vary between 59% (underuse) and 107% (overuse), and are lower (38%) in China compared to other countries.5–7 Non-adherence to methotrexate is associated with high disease activity and worse joint function.8 Additionally, poor adherence, including an overdose of methotrexate, leads to serious adverse reactions and even death.9
      Fear of adverse reactions and treatment disappointment are the most common reasons for patients to stop taking methotrexate.10 Therefore, measures to change patients’ cognition, such as patient education programs, motivational interview training, psychological intervention, and medical communication, can effectively reduce the occurrence of patients’ voluntary discontinuation of medication.11–13 However, most of the patients who did not stop taking medication had incorrect medication, including reducing the dose, skipping the dose, and even taking an overdose.14 Incorrect use of methotrexate will increase the frequency and severity of adverse reactions, reduce the therapeutic effect, and undermine patients’ trust in the treatment plan. Switching to subcutaneous injection of methotrexate has improved patient adherence,14 but it is not suitable for all patients with RA. Measures such as using emails, text messages, or phone reminders have a positive effect on the accuracy of patients’ medication;15 however, they are not suitable for older patients who are not proficient in using electronic devices. The picture-based medication calendar can remind patients of the time and dosage of medication intuitively and concisely, and can be viewed and recorded by patients at any time. It is an adherence management tool with great potential. In the field of tumor treatment, medication calendars have been proven to effectively improve medication compliance, meet family care needs, assist medication supervision, and help cultivate the habit of correct medication.16 However, there are few studies on the design of antirheumatic drug calendars for RA treatment. Additionally, the development of personalized medication calendars remains challenging. There are differences in calendar creation, and a simplified method is needed to create medication calendars. This study aims to develop an antirheumatic drug calendar based on a graphic combination design with an adjustable dose label to achieve personalized adherence reminders and verify its effectiveness in improving methotrexate medication adherence in patients with RA through a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.
    
    
      Materials and Methods
      
        Trial Design
        The 2010 Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines for reporting randomized controlled trials were followed to describe the methods used in this study. To develop an antirheumatic medication calendar and evaluate its effectiveness in improving methotrexate adherence, we conducted a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Patient recruitment took place between October 2023 and January 2024 at Ningbo Sixth Hospital, a tertiary orthopedic center renowned for its expertise in orthopedic disease management in eastern Zhejiang, China. Recruitment was continuous without interruption. All recruited patients were administered methotrexate for the first time or had discontinued its use for >3 months to eliminate the influence of prior methotrexate use. The patients were divided into the medication calendar group and the control group. One researcher generated the group number for participants using a randomly generated sequence in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA), while another concealed the numbers using masked envelopes. When a patient met the inclusion criteria, the physician opened the envelope on-site to determine the group allocation. The allocation ratio was 1:1. All research data were collated using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp.) and analyzed by another researcher who was blinded to the allocation. Supplementary Figure S1 displays the study flow diagram.
        The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, approved by the Ethics Committee of Ningbo Sixth Hospital (license number: 2023–06 [X]), and registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on September 27, 2023 (ChiCTR2300076228).
      
      
        Eligibility of Participants
        The eligibility of patients was confirmed by a rheumatologist and a researcher. Randomization was performed after the patients signed an informed consent form. Patient information was recorded and saved in Microsoft Excel, and it was maintained and updated by a researcher who was blinded to the randomization.
        The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) age >18 years; (ii) adherence to the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 RA classification criteria and an RA diagnosis by a rheumatologist;17 (iii) requirement of methotrexate treatment as determined by a rheumatologist; and (iv) either first-time use of methotrexate or discontinuation of methotrexate for >3 months. The reasons for discontinuation were low compliance and voluntary discontinuation by the patient.
        The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) contraindications to methotrexate or a history of adverse reactions to methotrexate; (ii) inability to understand the medication calendar; (iii) inability to take care of oneself; (iv) having a mental illness or unconsciousness; and (v) refusal to follow-up or sign the informed consent form.
      
      
        Interventions
        The medication calendar in this study was designed by a research team consisting of clinicians, clinical pharmacists, and nursing staff and was adjusted based on the patient’s experience and suggestions in the preliminary trial. The medication calendar comprised a calendar and a drug label. It was a monthly calendar with white text on a dark background for weekdays and a blue background for weekends. The date was enlarged, and the lunar calendar was added to make reading easier for older adults. The drug label included the outer packaging, color, and shape of methotrexate tablets, and the number of pills to be taken. Certain areas of the drug label were covered with an ink layer that, when scratched, revealed the words “taken” or “booked”. This feature helped reduce patients’ errors in medication intake and minimized instances of missed follow-up visits. The calendar and label were mass-produced, matched, and combined according to the doctor’s instructions (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2).
Figure 1Calendar design tracking dosages and medication schedules.
        Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the medication calendar group or control group in a 1:1 ratio. All patients received drug education from rheumatologists, nurses, and pharmacists before receiving the first dose, including information on usage and dosage, pharmacological effects, adverse reactions, and follow-up requirements. All patients had labels on the outer packaging of the medicine, including usage, dosage, and frequency of use. All patients received their first dose of methotrexate (7.5 mg) for 2 weeks, after which the physician evaluated the patient’s condition and adjusted the methotrexate dose for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the physician evaluated the patient’s condition and adjusted the methotrexate dose. Patients in the medication calendar group were given a medication calendar matching the dose for 6 weeks, whereas those in the control group were not. Follow-ups were conducted at 2, 6, and 10 weeks to evaluate the impact of the medication calendar on patient adherence (Supplementary Figure S3). When distributing the medication calendar, the researchers demonstrated to the patients how to use it correctly and asked them to explain it again to ensure that they could use it independently. At each follow-up visit, the researchers confirmed whether the patients used the medication calendar correctly. Patients who did not use the calendar correctly or did not use it at all were excluded.
      
      
        Outcomes
        The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients achieving a proportion of days covered (PDC) value of 100%. The impact of medication calendar use and discontinuation was evaluated at 6 and 10 weeks. The PDC value was calculated as follows: number of days of correct medication within a certain period after the first dose of methotrexate divided by the total number of days. Secondary outcomes included the PDC value, the correct patient adherence rate, the rate of correct medication use at each follow-up time point, the rate of subsequent visits, RA disease activity, and patient satisfaction. RA disease activity was measured using the Disease Activity Score 28 with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP). Patient satisfaction was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale based on whether they wanted to continue using the medication calendar. Safety outcomes included adverse reactions to methotrexate. Medication errors were classified into four categories.
        “Wrong time:” Taking the correct dose at the wrong time (patients have an inaccurate memory of time).
        “Missed medication:” Not taking medication at the correct time (patients have an accurate memory of time).
        “Take less medication:” Not taking enough doses at the correct time (patients have an accurate memory of time).
        “Take over medication:” Overdose at the correct time (patients have an accurate memory of time).
        The patient’s medication information was obtained by the attending physician during the follow-up visit. If the patient failed to follow up on time, the information was obtained by telephone.
      
      
        Sample
        A power analysis was performed using the G*Power 3.1.9.7 program (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany) to determine the sample size with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%. Considering a 10% loss to follow-up rate, the minimum sample size for each group was 36.
      
      
        Statistical Analysis
        Normally distributed data are expressed as means (standard deviations), and differences between the groups were analyzed using independent and paired Student’s t-tests. Non-normally distributed data are expressed as medians (IQR) and were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U-test for two-group comparisons. Differences between the two sample rates were analyzed using the chi-square test. According to a previous study,18 we estimated a mean difference of 20–30% in the proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100% between the two groups. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 26; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA), and statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
      
    
    
      Results
      
        Patients
        Of the 79 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 38 were randomly assigned to the medication calendar group and 41 to the control group. Two patients in the medication calendar group were excluded because they did not use the medication calendar as required, resulting in a total of 77 patients. Both groups met the sample size requirements. The male-to-female ratio was 1:2.4 (23 versus [vs] 56), the average age was 51.39 (14.76) years, and the average RA duration was 3.0 (1.00–5.00) years. The patient’s disease activity (DAS28-CRP) was 4.52 (0.84). The proportion of farmers was 37.9%. Over 80% of the patients had completed primary education, and > 75% had one or more underlying diseases. Almost all patients received concomitant medications, including those for other chronic diseases and antirheumatic drugs in addition to methotrexate. No significant differences were observed in the baseline data between the groups (Table 1).Table 1Characteristics of the Study PopulationCalendar (N = 38)Control (N = 41)P-valueAge in years, mean (SD)52.66 (12.07)50.22 (16.94)0.467Sex, n (%)0.331Male9 (23.7)14 (34.1)Female29 (76.3)27 (65.9)Occupation, n (%)0.702Manual worker8 (21.1)12 (29.3)Farmer16 (42.1)14 (34.1)Office worker9 (23.7)7 (17.1)Freelance worker1 (2.6)3 (7.3)Unemployed4 (10.5)5 (12.2)Education level, n (%)0.410Never received education7 (18.4)7 (17.1)Grade school education15 (39.5)11 (26.8)Secondary education10 (26.3)18 (43.9)Higher education6 (15.8)5 (12.2)Duration of rheumatoid arthritis in years, median (IQR)3.0 (1.00–4.25)3.0 (1.00–7.50)0.990DAS28-CRP, mean (SD)4.48(0.77)4.56(0.91)0.662Underlying disease, n (%)0.451No10 (26.3)9 (21.9)1 disease17 (44.7)15 (36.6)2 diseases7 (18.4)7 (17.1)≥ 3 diseases4 (10.5)10 (24.4)Concurrent polypharmacy, n (%)0.8411 chronic medication8 (21.5)9 (22.0)2 chronic medications4 (10.5)6 (14.6)≥ 3 chronic medications26 (68.4)26 (63.4)Concurrent antirheumatic drugs, n (%)0.727No1 (2.6)0 (0.0)1 medication13 (34.2)16 (39.0)2 medications20 (52.6)20 (48.8)≥ 3 medications4 (10.5)5 (12.2)Abbreviations: SD, Standard Deviation; IQR, Interquartile Range.
      
      
        Primary Outcome
        The proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100% in the medication calendar group was significantly higher than that in the control group (97.2% vs 73.2%, P < 0.004). After discontinuing the medication calendar, the proportion was still significantly higher than that in the control group (88.9% vs 68.9%, P < 0.03) but showed a downward trend (Figure 2A).

        Secondary Outcome
        The correct medication adherence rates within 10 weeks were 87.81% in the medication calendar group and 69.00% in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.343; 95% confidence interval, 0.139–0.851; P = 0.0307) (Figure 2B). After 6 weeks, no significant difference was observed in PDC values between the two groups (100.0% [100.0–100.0%] vs 100.0% [95.24–100.0%], P = 0.217). However, higher patient distribution was observed in areas with high PDC values on the violin plot in the medication calendar group than in the control group (Figure 2C). Following the discontinuation of the medication calendar, the distribution of patients began to shift toward lower PDC values (Figure 2C). At each follow-up time point, the correct medication adherence rate was significantly higher in the medication calendar group than in the control group (97.2% vs 75.36%, P < 0.007), particularly at week 2 (100.0% vs 80.0%, P < 0.006) (Figure 2D and Supplementary Table 1). At the other follow-up points (6 and 8 weeks), no significant difference was observed in the administration accuracy between the two groups. During the two follow-up visits when doctors adjusted the dosage, the on-time follow-up rate was higher in the medication calendar group than in the control group (97.2% vs 78.0%, P = 0.016; 91.7% vs 70.7%, P < 0.021) (Figure 3A). During the 10-week period, five patients (13.12%) in the medication calendar group and four (9.76%) in the control group, including one (2.43%) who had drug overdose, experienced adverse reactions (Figure 3B). The only medication error in the medication calendar group was a wrong time error. Other error types were observed only after discontinuation of the medication calendar. The distribution of error types in the control group was similar (Figure 3C and D). At each follow-up time point, there was no significant difference in disease activity between the two groups of patients (Figure 4A). However, when the patient’s sixth-week data were used as a control, the disease activity of patients in the calendar group still decreased significantly at week 10, while the disease activity of patients in the control group did not decrease (Figure 4B).

        Among the 36 participants who used medication calendars, 92.1% believed that the calendar reminded them to take their medications, 94.7% felt it reduced dosage errors, 89.5% found it helpful for scheduling follow-up appointments in advance, 94.7% considered it beneficial for medication management, and 97.3% found it easy to understand. Furthermore, 94.7% of patients in the calendar group believed that the medication calendar improved their adherence and anticipated continued use of the calendar (Figure 4C).
      
    
    
      Discussion
      According to epidemiological data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, by 2021, the age group with the largest number of RA cases in China is expected to be between 50 and 54 years old, with women accounting for a higher proportion than men.19 The age and gender distribution of patients with RA included in this study are consistent with the above results. However, it is worth noting that in terms of occupation, there was a higher proportion of farmers among patients. In another study of palindromic rheumatism by the team, patients with RA as controls also showed a higher proportion of farmers (51.5%).20 Besides the large group of farmers in China itself, the cause of this phenomenon may also be related to the lack of medical resources in the rural areas where farmers live. Farmers often lack an understanding of RA prevention and treatment methods. Humid rural environments and long-term labor may promote the occurrence and progress of RA.21 Furthermore, only a small number of patients in this study received higher education, which also explains why most patients only started to take methotrexate continuously with at least 1 year of RA. Expanding medical resource coverage in rural areas and RA prevention and treatment missions for low-educated farmers may be one of the keys to reducing the burden of RA disease in China.
      In China, the compliance rate of patients with RA ranges from 38.6% to 80.2%. If only the compliance of methotrexate is considered, the compliance rate may be even lower. The main barriers to methotrexate compliance in current studies include adverse reactions and treatment disappointment.10,22 Patients’ concerns about the treatment plan may lead them to stop taking the drug or actively reduce the dose of methotrexate.14 Therefore, patient education programs that increase doctor-patient communication, improve patient knowledge, and reduce the fear of adverse reactions to methotrexate can effectively reduce the proportion of patients with RA who actively stop taking the drug.23–25 However, patients who are willing to take methotrexate face another major barrier to compliance, which is taking the wrong medication. As a “non-daily treatment” (taking the drug only once a week), the phenomenon of missing medication exists in most patients.14,22 Similarly, in this study, only 75.6% of patients in the control group took methotrexate correctly within 2 weeks after the first visit, indicating that without additional intervention, approximately 25% of patients will use methotrexate incorrectly after discharge. What is more noteworthy is that the proportion of patients who unconsciously take less medication was higher than those who miss it. Incorrect use can lead to poor treatment effects of methotrexate, increased incidence of adverse reactions, and even toxic reactions, which in turn lead to patients’ doubts about the treatment plan and fear of adverse reactions, prompting them to stop taking the drug on their initiative. Therefore, how to get patients to take methotrexate correctly is also a key node to improve compliance.
      Regular reminders are one of the effective measures to address unintentional non-adherence. Weekly reminder text messages have been shown to have a positive impact on the adherence of patients with RA taking methotrexate.26 However, some studies have pointed out that reminder text messages have limited effects, and it is difficult to improve the effect of medication reminders alone without the support of medical staff.23,27 Digital interventions, such as Email reminders or online patient portals, can also effectively improve patient compliance when used as medication reminders.28 Unfortunately, in China, the number of people who register for Email accounts and check them regularly is relatively small, especially among older adults. Skilled and active clinical pharmacists can make up for the above limitations,29–32 but the workload and cost of clinical pharmacists conducting multiple education or follow-up visits for each patient need to be considered, especially in China, where there is a shortage of clinical pharmacists. An effective, easier-to-implement, and less costly medication calendar may be a better choice.
      In oncology, caregivers of children with cancer often make mistakes when administering medication in the home setting, including incorrect dosing or frequency and missed doses.33,34 This is very similar to unintentional non-adherence in methotrexate treatment. An effective medication calendar system can encourage patients to take their medication correctly.35 However, standardizing the construction of medication calendars is crucial to limiting its clinical application. The printability of medication calendars and the ability to easily adjust medications and doses are of greatest concern.36 The medication calendar in this study was composed of two components: a calendar and a medication label. Medication labels can be designed to display different medications and doses based on a physician’s medication regimen. When obtaining information, patients preferred pictures to text, and graphic-based medication labels were easier to understand.37,38 An ink layer that could be scraped off by the patient was included to prevent repeated administration of the same medication. The family members of patients in the medication calendar group reported that they used this mark to remind them to take their medications. Once the initial design is completed, the medication calendar can be produced in large quantities without delay and at a low cost.
      The proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100% and the rate of correct medication adherence were used to assess the effect of the medication calendar. The proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100% was significantly higher in the medication calendar group compared to the control group, indicating that the medication calendar improved patient adherence. This finding was further confirmed by the correct medication adherence rates. The difference in medication accuracy between the groups was most pronounced during the first 2 weeks; however, the rates improved thereafter, narrowing the difference. This increase was likely attributed to additional medication education provided by doctors and pharmacists during follow-up visits, which had an effect similar to that of the medication calendar. No significant difference in PDC values between the groups was observed during the period of medication calendar usage, potentially due to the insufficient observation period. However, the control group had a higher proportion of patients with low PDC values compared to the medication calendar group.
      In the control group, patient medication errors were mainly concentrated in “Take less medication”. And “Take over medication”, the most dangerous medication error also occurred in one case. This also confirmed that medication calendars reduced the risk and severity of medication errors. Compared with patients in the control group, those in the medication calendar group had significantly higher on-time follow-up rates at both times.
      However, the benefits of using the medication calendar waned after discontinuation. The PDC values of patients in the medication calendar group also began to trend toward lower PDC values. Moreover, the proportion of patients with 100% PDC decreased. At 4 weeks after discontinuing the medication calendar, medication adherence in both groups began to decline despite further medication education. Dosage errors were also observed in the medication calendar group. This suggests that the benefits of the medication calendar are based on its continued use; nonetheless, errors might have been observed because the medication calendar was not used for sufficient time to have a lasting effect. In this study, the use of methotrexate resulted in a significant decrease in disease activity for both patient groups compared to the baseline; however, no difference was observed between the two groups. The reason for this phenomenon may be that although the proportion of patients in the control group who took methotrexate correctly was lower than that in the drug calendar group, it still accounted for about 70%. The treatment effect of this part of patients masked the difference in disease activity. Secondly, among patients who took it incorrectly, the main type of error was taking less medication, with no active discontinuation of medication. Therefore, methotrexate can still play a specific therapeutic role, narrowing the treatment gap with patients in the drug calendar group. Additionally, as a drug with a slower onset, the effect of taking methotrexate correctly may require a longer follow-up time to be reflected. When the patient’s sixth-week data was used as a control, the disease activity of patients in the calendar group still decreased significantly, while the disease activity of patients in the control group did not decrease significantly. This may be a reflection of the effect of taking methotrexate correctly in the first six weeks. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups. However, one patient in the control group developed severe oral ulcers due to daily oral administration of methotrexate. Toxic reactions to drug overdose are more dangerous than other adverse reactions. In the satisfaction assessment conducted at the end of the study, most patients in the medication calendar group felt that the calendar was effective, concise, and easy to use, and they expressed a desire to continue using it in the future.
      During the medication calendar usage, regardless of whether there was a medication error, patients and their families used the medication calendar to recall the medication process more accurately. In contrast, patients in the control group had ambiguity/uncertainty in recalling medication use, which was also a cause of errors. The medication calendar appears to be an auxiliary tool for improving the accuracy of adherence assessments. This study did not verify this effect to evaluate related outcomes.
      This study had some limitations. First, owing to constraints in funding and personnel, we were unable to recruit a larger number of patients or extend the use of the medication calendar for a longer period. This limitation may have reduced the ability of the medication calendar to help patients develop a consistent habit of taking methotrexate correctly. Second, while the medication calendar helped reduce unintentional medication errors, the study did not include patients with intentionally low adherence—such as those who discontinued medication owing to concerns about side effects or symptom improvement. Third, the medication calendar may increase the likelihood that the patient’s relatives will remind or help more accurately, which may also be one of the mechanisms by which the medication calendar works. However, that will lead to an overestimation of the patient’s medication adherence. We did not intervene in the behavior of the patient’s relatives because this would affect the real-world care mechanism and prevent the patients from seeking support on their own. Since it is impossible to predict which relatives of the patients will assist the patients, this study did not record the educational level of the patient’s relatives. Additionally, the inclusion of patients re-initiating methotrexate after >3 months, while necessary for recruitment feasibility, may introduce unmeasured confounding from prior drug exposure. Although dose titration was restarted and historical details were unavailable, subtle biases related to past efficacy/tolerability experiences cannot be fully excluded. In further research, the study scale will be expanded to include more research centers and sample sizes, the recruitment time will be extended, etc. Additionally, different subgroup analyses will be conducted to minimize the interference of patients’ relatives or explore the impact of previous methotrexate exposure on outcomes.
    
    
      Conclusion
      The antirheumatic medicine calendar improved drug adherence in patients taking methotrexate for the first time, as recognized by the patients. However, this effect was not sustained after the calendar use was discontinued.

Title: Changes in the Skin Microbiome of a Patient with Head and Neck Cancer with Severe Radiodermatitis: A Case Report

Abstract: AbstractIntroductionIdentifying the skin microbiome associated with severe radiodermatitis could lead to the development of preventive care strategies and early healing interventions, which are currently lacking. In this study, we investigated changes in the skin microbiome of a patient with head and neck cancer who developed severe radiodermatitis from the initiation of radiation therapy to the resolution of dermatitis.Case PresentationAn 82-year-old male underwent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (69.96 Gy/33 fractions) for recurrent laryngeal cancer after a total laryngectomy. At baseline, Cutibacterium accounted for 64.3% of the skin microbiome and Staphylococcus for 23.2%. During the occurrence of moist desquamation associated with severe radiodermatitis, Cutibacterium decreased sharply to 0.2%, whereas Staphylococcus increased to 91.0%. Species-level analysis revealed that Staphylococcus aureus was dominant at 50.6%, whereas Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were identified at 0.4% and 1.7%, respectively.ConclusionThese findings demonstrated that changes in the skin microbiome occur during the progression of severe radiodermatitis. The reduction in Cutibacterium and overgrowth of Staphylococcus, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, suggest their involvement in the development of severe radiodermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer.

Body: Introduction
      In addition to surgery, definitive radiotherapy is an essential treatment option for head and neck cancer that is administered to many patients. Radiation induces DNA damage in basal epidermal and hair follicle stem cells, triggering inflammatory responses. Consequently, most patients with head and neck cancers develop radiodermatitis that manifests as dry skin and erythema, and approximately 25% experience severe radiodermatitis with moist desquamation [1]. Severe radiodermatitis significantly reduces patients’ quality of life as it causes intense pain, making its prevention a critical aspect of care. Numerous studies on its prevention using recommended cleansing and moisturizing agents have been conducted; however, effective preventive care strategies remain unclear.
      Recent studies have revealed an association between inflammatory skin diseases and the skin microbiome, leading to the development of new treatment approaches targeting Staphylococcus aureus in atopic dermatitis [2]. As radiodermatitis is also caused by radiation-induced inflammation, it is plausible that the skin microbiome is involved. Previous studies have demonstrated an increase in S. aureus on skin affected by severe radiodermatitis [3], and a lower relative abundance of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, and Cutibacterium acnes is associated with the development of severe radiodermatitis in patients with breast cancer [4]. However, no studies have investigated the longitudinal changes in the skin microbiome throughout the course of severe radiodermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer, making it unclear which bacterial species could serve as potential targets for preventive interventions.
      In this study, we examined the longitudinal changes in the skin microbiome at the irradiated site in a patient with head and neck cancer who developed radiodermatitis with moist desquamation from before the initiation of radiotherapy until radiodermatitis resolved.
    
    
      Case Presentation
      The patient was an 82-year-old male who underwent chemoradiotherapy (cisplatin combined with 69.96 in Gy/33 fractions using volumetric modulated arc therapy with 6 MV X-ray) for recurrent stage IV laryngeal cancer in January 2023. Radiotherapy was administered once daily in five fractions per week without discontinuation. The prescribed dose of radiotherapy was 70 Gy for gross tumor volume, 59.4 Gy for high-risk clinical target volume, and 54 Gy for low-risk clinical target volume in 33 fractions. The patient underwent a total laryngectomy, resulting in a tracheostoma. Before radiotherapy (baseline), skin barrier function assessment indicated corneometer hydration at 56.0, transepidermal water loss at 13.57 g/h/m2, skin pH at 4.90, and sebum secretion at 6 µg.
      Faint erythema appeared during the first week of treatment (10.6 Gy) and intensified to moderate erythema by the 6th week (63.3 Gy). By the 7th week (1 day after completion of radiotherapy), extensive moist desquamation was observed. However, dermatitis healed with scab formation by the 10th week (22 days after radiotherapy completion) (Fig. 1). Starting from the 5th week, the patient was administered heparin lotion and azulene ointment on the irradiated area. From the 7th week, when moist desquamation occurred, corticosteroids and nonadherent gauze were applied until healing was achieved. Due to the presence of a tracheostoma, the patient had difficulty performing self-care, so nurses performed skin cleansing and treatment.

          The course of radiodermatitis in this case. Radiodermatitis progressed from faint erythema during the first week/10.6 Gy (a) to moderate erythema at 6 weeks/63.30 Gy (b), extensive moist desquamation at 7 weeks/1st day post-radiotherapy (c), and dermatitis healed with scab formation by the 10th week (22 days after radiotherapy completion) (d).
        
        
      
      Skin samples were collected weekly from baseline until the resolution of radiodermatitis from the side of the neck (within the irradiated field) using swabs. The skin microbiome composition was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing using a next-generation sequencer based on the relative abundance of bacterial species. At baseline, the microbiome consisted of Cutibacterium (64.3%) and Staphylococcus (23.2%). During radiotherapy, Cutibacterium remained predominant; however, by the 7th week (1 day after radiotherapy completion), Staphylococcus accounted for 91.0%, whereas Cutibacterium dropped to 0.2% and did not recover even after radiodermatitis healed (Fig. 2). At the species level (Fig. 3), S. aureus accounted for 50.6%, S. hominis for 0.4%, and S. epidermidis for 1.7% during the 7th week when Staphylococcus had increased. DNA amplification failed in skin microbiome samples from the 3rd, 6th, and 8th weeks, making analysis impossible.

      Discussion
      In a patient with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy, the onset of severe radiodermatitis coincided with changes in skin microbiome composition: a marked decrease in Cutibacterium and an increase in Staphylococcus. These findings suggest a possible association between skin microbiome dysbiosis and severe radiodermatitis. The skin microbiome is predominantly composed of Cutibacterium, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium, the relative abundances of which are influenced by physical, chemical, and biological factors, including skin moisture [5]. During head and neck radiotherapy, high doses (approximately 70 Gy) are delivered, exacerbating skin inflammation and dryness when radiodermatitis becomes severe. The baseline skin barrier function of the patient was intact; however, changes in the skin condition due to radiodermatitis appear to have led to alterations in the composition of the skin microbiome, characterized by a decrease in Cutibacterium and an increase in Staphylococcus.
      Moist desquamation leads to exudate production and alters skin pH owing to the application of ointments, which may also promote changes in the composition of the skin microbiome. As Staphylococcus thrives in moist environments, such as the axillae [5], the moist conditions caused by exudate and ointment application during severe radiodermatitis likely facilitated its proliferation. Conversely, Cutibacterium was predominant in sebum-rich areas. Radiation-induced impairment of sebaceous gland function and a subsequent decrease in sebum levels likely contributed to the reduction in Cutibacterium. Similar trends have been reported in patients with atopic dermatitis, where reduced Cutibacterium and increased Staphylococcus counts were associated with impaired skin barrier function, elevated skin pH, and decreased sebum levels [6]. In the present case, even after radiodermatitis healed, the skin microbiome did not return to its baseline composition. This may be due to persistent skin barrier dysfunction, as skin temperature elevation [7] and increased transepidermal water loss levels [8] reportedly persist even after the resolution of radiodermatitis.
      The skin microbiome plays a vital role in maintaining skin health owing to its diversity and balance. A previous study has reported a significant reduction in skin microbiome diversity in areas affected by radiodermatitis [9]. At the microbial species level, an increased S. aureus density promotes inflammation [5]. S. aureus colonization is common in severe atopic dermatitis, in which skin barrier dysfunction allows it to penetrate the dermis and trigger inflammatory cytokines [10]. In contrast, S. hominis and S. epidermidis inhibit S. aureus colonization [11]. The low abundances of S. hominis and S. epidermidis in this case may have contributed to the proliferation of S. aureus. Previous studies have reported an association between reduced S. hominis and S. epidermidis levels and the onset of radiodermatitis [4], as well as increased S. aureus levels in radiation-damaged skin [3]. Additionally, because the stratum corneum becomes thinner during radiodermatitis and the skin barrier is compromised, increased inflammation caused by S. aureus proliferation may exacerbate the severity of radiodermatitis. S. hominis, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus may serve as key bacterial targets for preventing severe radiodermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer.
      The findings of this study suggest that dysbiosis of the skin microbiome may contribute to the development of severe radiodermatitis, with particular involvement of Cutibacterium and Staphylococcus, especially S. aureus. Recent work has demonstrated a gut-skin microbial axis, suggesting that interventions to maintain gut microbial balance could help prevent skin-microbiome dysbiosis [12]. Additionally, a report shows topical prebiotics can restore skin microbial diversity and reduce S. aureus abundance [13]. However, further case reports and studies are needed to develop preventive care strategies based on microbiome alterations. Study limitations include the inability to analyze certain samples due to radiation-induced DNA degradation and the challenge of collecting microbiome samples from fragile, radiation-damaged skin. To overcome these limitations, future studies should explore alternative skin microbiome sampling methods and incorporate additional biomarkers, such as skin blotting, a technique that collects molecules non-invasively.
    
    
      Conclusions
      This case reveals that changes in the skin microbiome occur during the progression of severe radiodermatitis, suggesting that Cutibacterium and Staphylococcus, particularly S. aureus, are involved in the development of severe radiodermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer.

Title: Establishment of age-related AMH screening cutoffs in Chinese women with PCOS: a retrospective study using propensity score matching analysis

Abstract: BackgroundPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects 5–18% of women worldwide. This disorder is characterized by two core pathological features: ovulatory dysfunction and hyperandrogenism.MethodA retrospective analysis was conducted on cases treated at Hangzhou Women’s Hospital from July 2021 to November 2023. Based on age, we conducted propensity score matching analysis in a 1:1 ratio and statistical analysis using SPSS software, plotted receiver operating characteristic curves, and obtained the area under the curve, the optimal anti-Müllerian hormone screening threshold, corresponding sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, correct diagnostic rate, positive predictive value, negative predictive value. Age-related anti-Müllerian hormone screening criteria with polycystic ovary syndrome were established and evaluated based on the optimal anti-Müllerian hormone screening cutoff for each group. The above results were validated by the validation group. And Kappa consistency test was conducted between the age-related anti-Müllerian hormone screening test and 2003 Rotterdam criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome.ResultsThe screening criteria for age-related anti-Müllerian hormone with polycystic ovary syndrome were: ≥7.46 ng/ml (20-24-year-old), ≥ 4.55 ng/ml (25-29-year-old), ≥ 4.19 ng/ml (30-34-year-old), ≥ 3.57 ng/ml (35-39-year-old).ConclusionOur research indicates that age specific AMH threshold values show promising sensitivity and specificity for PCOS screening in the validation cohort. These findings indicate the potential utility of AMH based screening, but emphasize the need for optimization and validation in larger multicenter studies before clinical implementation.Clinical trial numberNot applicable.

Body: Introduction
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects 5–18% of women worldwide [1], according to the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria. A 2013 epidemiological survey of 16,886 community women of childbearing age in 10 provinces and cities in China [2] showed that the prevalence of PCOS was 5.61%. Since then, epidemiological studies in various regions have found that the incidence rate of PCOS is on the rise. For example, in 2014, the reported prevalence of PCOS in Chengdu was 7.1% [3], and in 2019, 173 cases of PCOS were diagnosed in 1781 women aged 16 to 30 years old in Daxing District, Beijing, with a incidence rate of 9.71% [4]. In 2021, WU Q et al. [5] conducted a meta-analysis of 69 studies involving 154,599 participants, which showed that the latest PCOS prevalence rate in China has risen to 10.01%.The pathological features of this disease include reproductive axis dysfunction, metabolic disorders, and adrenal cortex dysfunction. Clinical manifestations include acne, hirsutism, infrequent or absent menstruation, all of which can lead to impaired ovarian function and reduced fertility [6].
      Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a peptide growth factor [7]. It is found in the granulosa cells of primary, preantral, and small antral follicles with a diameter less than 8 mm [8]. AMH plays a role in regulating the recruitment, development, and selection of follicles [9, 10]. The research established a positive correlation between serum AMH levels and antral follicle count (AFC) [11]. AMH is secreted by granulosa cells of preantral and antral follicles, and its concentration directly reflects the number of remaining follicles in the ovary, making it one of the most sensitive indicators for evaluating ovarian reserve. The AMH level shows a decreasing trend with age, gradually decreasing after reaching its peak during puberty and approaching zero after menopause, which can predict the risk of fertility decline and premature ovarian failure. AMH is currently the best indicator for evaluating ovarian reserve function, and the reference range for AMH varies among women of different age groups [12]. AMH, as a diagnostic indicator for PCOS, can reduce misdiagnosis caused by subjective factors such as ultrasound examination, help to more accurately identify PCOS patients, and thus improve the targeting and effectiveness of treatment. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of ovarian reserve function by detecting AMH levels in women of different age groups and combining them with other relevant indicators. Meanwhile, we also noticed the differences in AMH levels among different age groups. Therefore, when analyzing the data, we conducted stratified analysis on samples from different age groups to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. This study aims to establish age-related screening criteria for PCOS using AMH as an indicator.
    
    
      Materials and methods
      
        Patients
        Study design and participant selection: This retrospective cohort investigation analyzed clinical data from female patients receiving care at Hangzhou Women’s Hospital over a 28-month period (July 2021 to November 2023). Patients are screened through the hospital’s electronic medical record system, which includes reproductive medicine center clinics (IVF-ET consultation), endocrine metabolism clinics, and general gynecological clinics, to ensure coverage of different treatment needs. The participant selection process involved systematic screening of electronic health records from outpatient services using the Rotterdam diagnostic criteria (2003) (13)for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Eligible cases were required to demonstrate ≥ 2 of the following clinical manifestations: (1) oligo-ovulation or anovulation, (2) biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism, and/or (3) ultrasonographic evidence of polycystic ovarian morphology.
        Data collection methodology: A comprehensive medical record evaluation protocol was implemented, incorporating four key diagnostic components: detailed reproductive history documentation, standardized physical examinations, endocrine laboratory profiling (including serum androgen measurements), and transvaginal ultrasonographic assessments. This multi-modal approach enabled cross-verification of diagnostic parameters and clinical presentation alignment with PCOS diagnostic standards.
        Exclusion criteria were strictly applied to ensure sample integrity. If an individual is under 20 years old or over 39 years old and has used sex hormones or other drugs (which have an impact or interference on the various hormones tested in this study) within the past 3 months before the test, they will be excluded. Those with diabetes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or other conditions that could lead to hyperandrogenism were also excluded. Hyperandrogenemia, a pathological state in the female endocrine system, is characterized by elevated androgen levels or activity in the serum or increased sensitivity of peripheral target organs to androgens. This can disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and cause energy metabolism disorders. These conditions were identified through patient medical records and, when needed, additional laboratory tests. Furthermore, individuals with acute or chronic infections, systemic inflammatory diseases, or incomplete clinical data were excluded. The control group consisted only of women who did not exhibit any Rotterdam standard performance.
        Data Collection: In this study, we compiled a comprehensive dataset that included detailed patient demographics and clinical parameters. The demographic data collected included age, weight, height, and Body Mass Index (BMI). Clinical histories were thoroughly reviewed, covering menstrual and reproductive histories, past medical conditions, and detailed family medical histories. Endocrine profiles were meticulously evaluated through a series of laboratory tests. These tests measured levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), testosterone (T), the LH-to-FSH ratio, and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). All laboratory procedures followed international standard operating protocols within our hospital’s medical laboratory department to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. Our hospital uses Beckman Coulter DXI800 electrochemiluminescence analyzer for reproductive hormone testing, and the reagents are purchased from Haier Shi Biomedical Co., Ltd. The AMH detection adopts Roche E411 electrochemiluminescence analyzer, and the reagents are purchased from Roche Diagnostic Products (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.
      
      
        Statistics and analysis
        Data processing and hypothesis testing were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics v26.0. The study employed a comprehensive statistical approach to analyze the data. Measurement data were presented as median (Q1, Q3), while counting data were expressed as (N, %). The normality of the data was assessed using the Single Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For measurement data that followed a normal distribution, homogeneity of variance was first tested. If the variance was uniform, one-way ANOVA was applied; if not, Welch ANOVA was used. For non-normal distribution measurement data, the Mann-Whitney U test was employed, with P < 0.05 indicating statistical significance. Counting data were compared using chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Following the chi-square test, Bonferroni corrected z-test was used for column proportion comparison. All tests were two-tailed, with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
        We constructed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for AMH with and without incorporating the LH/FSH ratio as a screening test. From these curves, we derived several key metrics: Area Under the Curve (AUC): A measure of the overall diagnostic performance of the test, with higher values indicating better discrimination between disease and non-disease states. Optimal AMH Screening Cutoff Value: The threshold value of AMH that maximizes both sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing between PCOS and non-PCOS cases. Sensitivity: Calculated as (true positive)/(true positive + false negative), reflecting the test’s ability to correctly identify individuals with the disease. Specificity: Calculated as (true negative)/(true negative + false positive), indicating the test’s ability to correctly identify individuals without the disease. Youden Index: Defined as Sensitivity + Specificity − 1, ranging from 0 to 1. A value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination, while a value of 0 suggests the test performs no better than random guessing. Correct Diagnosis Rate (CDR): Calculated as (true positive + true negative)/total, representing the overall accuracy of the test. Positive Predictive Value (PPV): Calculated as (true positive)/(true positive + false positive), indicating the probability that a positive test result correctly identifies an individual with the disease. Negative Predictive Value (NPV): Calculated as (true negative)/(true negative + false negative), indicating the probability that a negative test result correctly identifies an individual without the disease. These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive evaluation of the diagnostic performance of AMH as a screening tool, both independently and in combination with the LH/FSH ratio.
        We use DeLong test to determine if there is a statistical difference between the AUC values of two ROC curves. Set the significance level to 0.05, if P < 0.05, it is considered that there is a significant difference in the AUC values between the two ROC curves; If P ≥ 0.05, it is considered that there is no significant difference in AUC values between the two ROC curves. Kappa consistency test was conducted between the test group and the 2003 Rotterdam criteria. Kappa value < 0.20 indicates poor consistency; 0.21–0.40 indicates weak consistency; 0.41–0.60 indicates moderate consistency; 0.61–0.80 represents the consistency height; 0.81-1.00 indicates strong consistency. To validate the diagnostic thresholds for AMH in different age groups, we conducted a validation study. This involved evaluating the performance of the AMH threshold screening test in a separate validation group. Through this process, we obtained key metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, correct diagnosis rate, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio. Additionally, a Kappa consistency test was performed to assess the agreement between the results of the validation group and the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, ensuring the reliability of the diagnostic thresholds established. To evaluate the correlation between AMH levels and age, we conducted a correlation test. Given that AMH and age may not follow a normal distribution in this study, we employed Spearman’s rank correlation test, which is suitable for non-parametric data. The significance level was set at P < 0.05. All analyses and visualizations were performed using R version 4.4.2.
        According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 346 cases of PCOS and 315 cases of non-PCOS were initially identified. To minimize potential bias caused by differences in baseline data, we performed propensity score matching analysis at a 1:1 ratio based on age. This resulted in a final test group consisting of 213 PCOS cases and 213 non-PCOS cases. Additionally, to validate the diagnostic thresholds, we re-collected cases and established an external validation group. This validation group was divided into a validation PCOS subgroup and a validation non-PCOS subgroup, each comprising 30 cases, for a total of 60 cases. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hangzhou Women’s Hospital (Ethical Review Number: Medical Ethics Review A-070).

        Statistical analysis of various indicators from different age in test group
        Age stratification was strictly aligned with the manufacturer-defined reference intervals of Roche cobas® assay kits (REF No. 06331076190, Roche study number RD001727) [13], which categorize age groups as: 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39 years based on established population-specific biomarker variations. There were 21, 96, 76, and 20 cases respectively.
        In 20-24-year-old group, age, BMI, FSH, LH, PRL, and LH/FSH ratio revealed no significant differences (P > 0.05). AMH levels and T differed statistically significant (P < 0.05) (Table 2).

        In 25-29-year-old group, there were no significant differences in age and FSH between two groups (P > 0.05). However, significant differences were observed in BMI, LH, PRL, AMH levels, T, and LH/FSH ratio (P < 0.05) (Table 2).
        In 30-34-year-old group, there was no significant difference in the age (P > 0.05). However, the distribution of BMI, FSH, LH, PRL, AMH levels, T, and LH/FSH ratio differed significantly between two groups (P < 0.05) (Table 2).
        In 35-39-year-old group, there was no significant difference in the age, BMI, FSH, and PRL (P > 0.05). However, the distribution of LH, AMH levels, T, and LH/FSH ratio differed significantly between two groups (P < 0.05) (Table 2).
        We used SPSS to draw ROC curves of AMH adding or not the LH/FSH ratio ​​for PCOS screening tests in test group (Fig. 1), and obtained the AUC of the ROC curve, the optimal AMH screening cutoff value, the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, correct diagnosis rate, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio.

        Establishment of age-related AMH screening criteria for PCOS
        Based on the aforementioned optimal AMH screening boundaries for PCOS in test group, the screening criteria for age-related AMH with PCOS were: ≥7.46 ng/ml (20-24-year-old), ≥ 4.55 ng/ml (25-29-year-old), ≥ 4.19 ng/ml (30-34-year-old), ≥ 3.57 ng/ml (35-39-year-old).
        A Kappa consistency test was conducted between the AMH screening test and 2003 Rotterdam criteria, resulting in a Kappa value of 0.56(P < 0.01). The age-related AMH screening test results for PCOS in test group were presented (Table 4).

      Discussion
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulation disorders, and metabolic abnormalities. Patients often seek medical attention for infertility or menstrual disorders, and their ovarian pathological manifestations include thinning of the granulosa cell layer and accelerated follicular atresia, which are directly related to elevated androgen levels [14–16]. In addition, 40–60% of patients were associated with obesity and insulin resistance, and the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease was significantly increased [17, 18]. This disease also causes more than 10% of patients to experience endometrial hyperplasia and mental health problems (such as depression/anxiety) before the age of 40 [19].The internationally recognized diagnostic standards mainly include the National Institutes of Health (1992) and Rotterdam criteria [20]. They are all based on European and American ethnic groups and are not completely suitable for Chinese women.
      Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), as an important biomarker of ovarian reserve, can be influenced by various factors. Age is a key factor affecting AMH levels. As age increases, AMH levels typically decrease, reflecting a reduction in ovarian reserve [21]. Additionally, studies have shown significant differences in AMH levels among different races and ethnicities. For example, African American women may have lower AMH levels at a younger age, but their decline may not be as significant with age, whereas Latin American and Chinese women may have lower AMH levels across all age groups compared to white women [22]. Smoking is also a significant factor affecting AMH levels. Smoking is associated with the decline in ovarian function and may reduce AMH levels by impacting ovarian reserve [23]. Additionally, medication use can also affect AMH levels. For example, certain chemotherapy drugs have been shown to cause damage to ovarian function, thereby affecting the recovery of AMH levels and the assessment of ovarian reserve [24].
      The serum AMH level is an indicator of the number of follicles growing, reflecting the state of androgens within the follicles [25], possibly due to the early stages of follicle growth stimulated by androgens [26, 27]. AMH levels also independently reflect the size of the follicular (“ovarian reserve”) pool [28]. The levels of serum androgens and testosterone are positively correlated with AMH levels [29]. There is a strong correlation between AMH concentration and the number of antral follicles, AMH may be a useful biomarker for follicular pool and ovarian aging [30, 31]. Serum AMH levels remain stable throughout different periods of the menstrual cycle with no significant difference [32–34], the differences between the same individuals during the menstrual cycle are minimal [35]. Many scholars suggest that AMH should be used as the diagnostic criteria for PCOS or as a supplement to the Rotterdam PCOS diagnostic criteria [36, 37]. The application of AMH in the medical field mainly includes the following aspects: 1. AMH level shows a decreasing trend with age, gradually decreasing after reaching its peak during puberty and approaching zero after menopause, which can predict the risk of fertility decline and premature ovarian failure. Therefore, serum AMH levels may be correlated with the severity of PCOS symptoms (hyperandrogenism or ovulation disorders)0.2. In assisted reproductive technology, AMH levels are used to assess a woman’s potential fertility and help predict ovarian responsiveness to assisted reproductive technology (ART). 3.In most cases, serum AMH is correlated with the number of oocytes obtained after exogenous gonadotropin controlled ovarian stimulation. Therefore, serum AMH is a reliable predictor of ovarian response to controlled ovarian stimulation [38, 39]. 4.AMH can predict ovarian response to ovulation inducing drugs and help develop personalized ovulation induction plans. Low AMH indicates a low risk of ovarian response and requires an increase in the dosage of ovulation promoting drugs; High AMH signals the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and requires adjustments to the treatment plan to reduce complications.5.AMH therapy has been proven effective in the field of tumor fertility to prevent the loss of primordial follicles observed during chemotherapy treatment, particularly through exposure to alkylating agents [40]. 6.AMH is a specific circulating indicator of granulosa cell tumors, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 76–91% and specificity of 90–100% [41]. The serum AMH level is directly proportional to the size of ovarian granulosa cell tumors and has a direct correlation with imaging results [42–44]. The new guidelines for PCOS in 2023 still use the Rotterdam criteria, but explicitly state that serum AMH testing can be used instead of pelvic ultrasound for the diagnosis of adult PCOS [45]. The concentration of AMH is closely related to clinical, endocrine, and ultrasound indicators, and may be a diagnostic biomarker for PCOS.
      Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) trends in the Chinese population can be influenced by several factors, including genetic, environmental, and lifestyle differences. A study examining the distribution of serum AMH levels among infertile Asian women, including Chinese participants, found that age, ethnicity, obesity, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) significantly impacted serum AMH levels. The study highlighted that the rate of AMH decrease accelerated with age [46].
      Reviewing previous studies, we found that serum AMH levels in PCOS were 2–4 times higher than those in normal [47], and serum AMH levels in patients with only polycystic ovary changes were significantly higher than those in normal, but significantly lower than those in PCOS [48]. In vivo and in vitro animal experiments [49] have confirmed that AMH may be involved in follicle development, indicating that AMH may inhibit the initiation of follicle growth. There is evidence that AMH counteracts the effects of FSH on aromatase activity, follicular growth and development [50, 51].
      The screening criteria for age-related anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have significant implications for Chinese women of childbearing age. 1.Improving the accuracy of PCOS diagnosis: Adopting age-related AMH screening criteria can more accurately identify PCOS patients and improve the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis. 2.Optimizing the allocation of medical resources: Through more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of treatment effectiveness, medical resources can be allocated reasonably, misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment can be reduced, and medical efficiency can be improved. 3.Promoting women’s health: The application of age-related AMH screening criteria can help detect and intervene in PCOS early, improve patients’ quality of life and reproductive health, and reduce the risk of long-term complications such as metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease.
      In this study, the AUC of the ROC curves in test group were greater than 0.7(P < 0.001), indicating that the age-related AMH screening test has high prediction accuracy. In the validation part, there is an imbalance between the sensitivity (80%) and specificity (63%) of AMH threshold, which may lead to an increase in clinical false positive rate. This phenomenon is related to insufficient age stratification, confounding factors (such as obesity) interference, indicating limitations in the universality of a single threshold. Although the Youden index and Kappa consistency did not reach the ideal level, the negative predictive value of AMH still has clinical reference value when excluding non PCOS cases, especially for the initial screening of high-risk populations.
      Although this study focused on the combined diagnostic efficacy of AMH and its LH/FSH ratio, as shown in Fig. 1, the use of LH/FSH ratio alone demonstrated certain diagnostic potential in the 20–24 age group (AUC = 0.65, p = 0.09, 95% CI 0.48–0.82) and 35–39 age group (AUC = 0.78, p = 0.03, 95% CI 0.62–0.96).
      This study did not include individuals aged ≤ 19 and ≥ 40, which may limit the generalizability of the results. Future research should expand the age range to validate the generalizability of conclusions.

Title: Gut microbiota constituents may affect hypertrophic scarring risk through interaction with specific immune cells in a two-step, two-sample Mendelian randomization study

Abstract: Hypertrophic scars (HS), classified as abnormal scarring, result from an overactive tissue response during wound healing following dermal trauma. Nonetheless, the precise mechanistic pathway underlying its occurrence remains elusive. The principal aim of this study is to elucidate the causal relationship among gut microbiota (GM), immune cell function, and hypertrophic scarring in a European demographic. Leveraging the genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) database, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study on gut microbiota (GM), immune cells, and HS. To ascertain the causality between GM, immune cells, and HS, we utilized the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method while employing multiple approaches to negate the effects of pleiotropy and heterogeneity. Furthermore, we quantitatively evaluated the influences of immune cells-mediated GM on hypertrophic scar through a two-step MR analysis. The two-sample MR analysis demonstrated a potential causality between 5 genera of gut microbiotas and 23 immune cell traits with respect to hypertrophic scarring. Further, our results showed that the causal pathway from the genus Subdoligranulum to hypertrophic scar (HS) was mediated by B cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) on CD20- CD38- B cell, with a beta value of 0.034 (95% CI [0.002, 0.066]; P = 0.004), contributing to 7.60% of the total effect of Subdoligranulum on HS. Similarly, CD24 on IgD + CD38 + B cell exhibited a causal impact in the pathway from genus Coprococcus 1 to HS, with a beta value of -0.015 (95% CI [-0.029, -0.001]; P = 0.023), constituting 6.70% of the total effect of Coprococcus 1 on HS. Additionally, the CD8 + T cell %T cell mediated the causal pathway from the genus Adlercreutzia to HS with a beta value of 0.075 (95% CI [0.017, 0.133]; P = 0.024), contributing to 10.10% of the total effect of Adlercreutzia on HS. Our study indicates that the development of hypertrophic scars might be influenced by specific gut microbiota and immune cells. We highlight the possible role of two distinct immune cell genotypes as mediators in this relationship. However, most statistical significance of these findings was not maintained after FDR correction, suggesting our results should be viewed as preliminary and interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to confirm these associations.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-07455-y.

Body: Introduction
      Hypertrophic scar (HS), categorized as a pathological scar1, results from the overgrowth of new connective tissue following damage to the dermis or deeper tissues. This type of skin injury is primarily characterized by endothelial cell proliferation and differentiation, heightened fibrosis, collagen deposition, and alteration in microcirculation and blood supply2. Frequently, HS is observed in surgical wounds, healed skin burns, skin lacerations, or inflammatory and infectious skin conditions such as acne, folliculitis, chickenpox, and vaccination sites3. Several growth factors and inflammatory cytokines4,5 have been identified as players in the establishment of HS. However, the exact mechanism underpinning the formation of HS still remains incompletely understood.
      Gut microbiota (GM) comprises the diverse microflora residing in the human digestive tract. The gut hosts the densest population of bacteria found in any part of the human body. These intestinal microflora are intrinsically linked with the gut epithelial barrier and immune system, potentially exerting a positive influence on the wound healing process6. Several studies7–9 have demonstrated that certain intestinal flora can significantly inhibit infection at wound sites, thus reducing scar formation. Moreover, gut microbiota has been identified as a possible source of targets for the prevention and treatment of various diseases10. Furthermore, recent research11,12 on the gut-skin axis underscores the importance of probiotics in the management of gut microbiota, maintenance of skin homeostasis, and wound healing. Concurrently, various studies13,14 have elucidated the critical involvement of numerous immune cells in the wound healing process. For instance, both preclinical and clinical investigations15,16 have posited neutrophils as vital components for effective wound healing, with macrophages contributing differentially to the healing phases by secreting different factors at each stage17. Additionally, it has been discovered that the excessive infiltration or activation of inflammatory cells mediated by immune cells could engender chronic non-healing wounds or pathological scarring18. Therefore, current evidence alludes to the dual role that immune cells play during injury repair.
      Recognizing the potential impact of GM and immune cells in the HS formation process, modern research aims to explore and confirm the causal relationships among varying intestinal flora, immune cells, and HS. By doing so, there is potential to find new therapeutic targets to prevent HS formation — an endeavor that promises to guide preventative measures against HS in clinical practice. Mendelian Randomization (MR) is an instrumental research method that utilizes genetic variations as tools to determine the causal effect of a phenotype or behavior on disease outcomes19, akin to the design of randomized controlled trials. MR stands out from traditional trials in its use of instrumental variables (IVs) to mitigate potential confounding factors. A valid instrumental variable is assumed when it is associated with the exposure, has no association with any confounders that could affect the relationship between exposure and outcome20, and bears no direct causal link to the outcome, apart from its relation through exposure21. Under these conditions, the plausible instrumental variable or set of variables for exposure can be used to estimate the causal effect of exposure on the outcome. Therefore, utilizing the most recent summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) on GM, immune cells, and hypertrophic scar, we conducted a two-step, two-sample mediation analysis to investigate their intertwined relationships.

        Ethics statement
        Each study incorporated in the GWAS used in the present study was approved by local research ethics committees or Institutional Review Boards, and all participants had given their informed consent22. All methods used in our study were conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations, and this study was reported online with the “Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Using Mendelian Randomization (STROBE-MR)21,22.
      
      
        Study design
        In this study, we employed a two-step MR approach to investigate the relationship between GM and the genetically predicted risk of hypertrophic scar, as well as the potential mediating role of immune cell signatures. The analysis procedures are outlined as follows:
        Step 1: Two-Sample MR Analysis. We first conducted a two-sample MR analysis to assess the causal effect of GM and immune cell signatures on hypertrophic scar. This step involved using genetic variants (SNPs) as IVs\ to estimate the causal relationships between GM, immune cell traits, and hypertrophic scar. We screened for GM and immune cell signatures that were highly related to the risk of hypertrophic scar.
        Step 2: Mediation Analysis. In the second step, we evaluated the causal effect of the filtered GM on the filtered immune cell signatures. We calculated the proportion of mediation for each immune cell signature in the relationship between GM and hypertrophic scar. This step involved assessing the extent to which immune cell signatures mediate the effect of GM on hypertrophic scar risk.
        To ensure the validity of the MR analysis, the research objects were kept non-overlapping. This means that the SNPs representing exposure (GM) and outcome (hypertrophic scar) were derived from different research sources.
        Through this systematic approach, we sought to discover the association between specific gut microbiota and immune cell characteristics, and identified the mediating role of specific immune cell characteristics in the initiation of hypertrophic scars by specific gut microbiota. The study design is visually represented in Fig. 1, which provides a clear overview of the analysis procedures. Figure 2 further illustrates the overall study design, showing how each component of the study interacts and contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between GM, immune cells, and hypertrophic scar.
        
Fig. 1Overview of the Mendelian randomization analytical framework. This figure illustrates the two - sample MR approach used to investigate the causal relationships between gut microbiota (GM), immune cells, and hypertrophic scar (HS). The diagram outlines the flow of analysis starting from the selection of genetic instruments from GWAS datasets for GM and immune cells, through to the estimation of their effects on hypertrophic scar risk. Key steps include the use of instrumental variables (IVs) to assess causality and the implementation of various statistical methods to address pleiotropy and heterogeneity. The parameters and symbols in the figure are explained as follows: βdirect represents the direct effect of gut microbiota on hypertrophic scars, without the mediating variable of immune cells; β1 represents the effect of the exposure (gut microbiota) on the mediator (immune cells); β2 represents the effect of the mediator (immune cells) on the outcome (hypertrophic scar); β3total represents the total effect of the exposure (gut microbiota) on the outcome (hypertrophic scar), calculated as β3total = βdirect + β1 × ββ2; Crosses (×): Indicate the exclusion of confounding factors in the analysis. These symbols show that the genetic instruments are not directly affected by confounding factors, ensuring the validity of the MR analysis.

        Data sources
        The gut microbiota data is derived from the MiBioGen23, the MiBioGen consortium meticulously curated and analyzed genome-wide genotypes alongside 16 S fecal microbiome data derived from a substantial cohort of 18,340 European individuals. Five unidentified microbial taxa were excluded, resulting in the inclusion of a total of 196 GM taxa across nine phyla, sixteen classes, twenty orders, thirty-two families, and one hundred nineteen genera. Data for hypertrophic scar was derived from the FinnGen consortium (L12_HYPETROPHICSCAR datasets). The L12_HYPETROPHICSCAR dataset contains 1,476 individuals. The control cases were sourced from a separate dataset within the FinnGen consortium, comprising 423,041 individuals. All participants in this data set were also from Europe. The comprehensive study design and rigorous data control procedures have been previously documented. Data for 731 immune cell traits (ebi-a-GCST0001391 to ebi-a-GCST0002121) were from the GWAS Catalog (Genome-wide association studies, https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/)24. The GWAS analysis was conducted on a cohort of 3,757 European adults, with adjustments made for gender and age. Approximately 220,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were subsequently evaluated. 731 immune cell traits could be divided into six panels: B cells, CDCs, mature stages of T cells, monocytes, myeloid cells, TBNK (B cells, natural killer cells, T cells), and Treg panels. In addition, 731 immune cell traits included absolute cell (AC) counts (n = 118), relative cell (RC) counts (n = 192), median fluorescence intensities (MFI) reflecting surface antigen levels (n = 389), and morphological parameters (MP) (n = 32).
      
      
        Genetic instrumental variables (IVs) selection
        To identify the genetic instruments for gut microbiota, immune cell traits, and hypertrophic scar, we followed the approach used in previous studies19,25,26 and adopted a less stringent threshold of P < 1 × 10− 5. This approach is commonly used in exploratory analyses to identify potential genetic instruments, although it may introduce some limitations. Specifically, valid Mendelian randomization analysis relies on the assumptions that the genetic variants are strongly associated with the exposure and that they affect the outcome only through the exposure (exclusion restriction). While our approach allows for the identification of a broader range of potential genetic instruments, it may also include some variants that do not meet these assumptions strictly. We acknowledge this as a limitation of our study and suggest that further validation is needed to confirm the robustness of our findings. This approach allowed us to identify a sufficient number of SNPs associated with gut microbiota, enabling us to detect potential causal relationships with hypertrophic scars. It should be emphasized that relaxing the threshold, while helpful in finding more potential associations, may also increase the risk of false positive results. Therefore, in subsequent analyses, we validated and assessed the reliability of the found associations by a variety of methods.
        We clumped all genetic variants using a threshold of R2 < 0.001 within a 10,000 kb clumping distance to ensure that the SNPs were independent. The F-statistic was applied to screen for SNPs27, calculated as β divided by the square of the standard error, with a cut-off value of 10 to exclude weak instruments28.
        This methodological adjustment was necessary to balance the trade-off between maintaining statistical power and controlling for false positives. By using a less stringent threshold, we were able to explore a broader range of potential associations while still ensuring the reliability of our findings through rigorous quality control measures and multiple sensitivity analyses.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        In this study, we used the clumping method to select independent SNPs from the GWAS data. This method groups SNPs based on genetic proximity and linkage disequilibrium, reducing the number of correlated SNPs and improving analysis efficiency. We set an r² threshold (< 0.001) and a clumping distance (10,000 kb) to ensure the selected SNPs were independent. It’s important to note that the clumping method doesn’t address sample overlap issues in MR analysis. To prevent sample overlap, which can bias effect estimates, we ensured the GWAS data for exposures and outcomes came from different studies. This approach eliminates the potential impact of sample overlap. By using clumping, we obtained a set of independent SNPs as instrumental variables for MR analysis, enhancing statistical power and reducing false positives. We also used multiple methods to verify the reliability of our findings.
        All statistical analyses were implemented with R 4.3.1 (https://www.r-project.org). The packages “TwoSampleMR,” “VariantAnnotation,” and “ieugwasr” were used to conduct two - sample MR analysis. Among the five methods (“MR Egger,” “Weighted median,” “Inverse variance weighted (IVW),” “Simple mode,” and “Weighted mode”) in MR analysis29,30, IVW was the primary method for causal estimation due to its precision and robustness31. However, we acknowledge that IVW has been reported30,31 to be sensitive to pleiotropy and invalid instrumental variables. To address this, we also used other methods such as MR Egger and Weighted median, which are more robust to pleiotropy. The results from these methods were consistent with the IVW results, providing further support for our findings. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate a significant association between exposure and outcome. Cochran’s Q statistic based on IVW and MR Egger methods was utilized to assess the degree of heterogeneity32. The MR - Egger intercept test was used to detect pleiotropy33. Leave - one - out analysis was conducted to explore the influence of potential outlying genetic variants34. Although the five MR methods used in this study do not directly address outlier testing, the Leave - one - out analysis can help identify and assess the impact of potential outliers. This method involves iteratively removing one genetic variant at a time and re - estimating the causal effect, which allows us to assess the stability of the results and identify any potential outliers that may have a significant impact on the overall findings. The Leave - one - out analysis is a widely used and effective approach for identifying and assessing the influence of potential outliers in MR studies34. The indirect effect of gut microbiota (GM) on hypertrophic scar risk via potential mediators was evaluated using the “product of coefficients” method35. Standard errors for the indirect effects were determined using the delta method36,37.
        In our study, we used both beta values and Odds Ratios (OR) to represent the effect sizes of genetic variants on the exposure and outcome variables38. The choice between beta values and OR values depends on the nature of the data and the specific analysis method used. We used beta values to represent the effect sizes in the GWAS summary data for the exposure (gut microbiota) and mediator (immune cells). These beta values were directly obtained from the GWAS summary data and used in the MR analysis without conversion. For the outcome (hypertrophic scar), we used OR values to represent the effect sizes. The OR values were obtained from the GWAS summary data and converted to beta values using the natural logarithm (β = ln(OR)) before being used in the MR analysis. In the mediation analysis, we used beta values to represent the effect sizes of the genetic instruments on the exposure and outcome variables. The conversion between OR and beta values was done as follows: From OR to Beta: The OR values were converted to beta values using the formula: β = ln(OR).
        To address the issue of multiple testing, we applied the False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction35 to adjust the p-values. The FDR correction was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which controls the expected proportion of false positives among the rejected hypotheses. This adjustment helps to mitigate the risk of Type I errors when conducting multiple statistical tests39.
      
    
    
      Results
      
        Total effect between GM and hypertrophic scar
        The study selected 2092 SNPs as IVs for 119 genera, 731 immune cell traits, and hypertrophic scar (Supplementray Table 1). The two-sample MR analysis demonstrated the positive an reverse causality between 5 genera on hypertrophic scar (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Tables 2–3). Although other methods did not reflect statistical significance, the IVW approach revealed increased genus Adlercreutzia (odds ratio (OR) = 1.392, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [1.010, 1.920], P = 0.043), genus Fusicatenibacter (odds ratio (OR) = 1.415, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [1.026, 1.953], P = 0.035) and genus Subdoligranulum (odds ratio (OR) = 1.574, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) [1.106, 2.239], P = 0.012) were associated with a higher risk of hypertrophic scar. The IVW method method illustrated the protective effects of family Clostridiaceae1 on hypertrophic scar (IVW: OR = 0.611, 95% CI [0.429, 0.871], P = 0.006), similar results were observed genus Coprococcus 1 (OR = 0.687, 95% CI [0.484, 0.976], P = 0.036). None of the other methods (MR Egger, Simple mode, Weighted mode, Weighted median) yielded significant results for these microbiota, indicating that the associations were most robust under the IVW method.
        In the reverse MR analysis, we found that only Clostridiaceae1 showed a significant association in the Weighted median method (OR = 1.061, 95%CI: 1.007, 1.117, P = 0.026). Other gut microbiota, including Adlercreutzia, Coprococcus1, Fusicatenibacter, and Subdoligranulum, did not show significant associations in any of the methods, with all p-values exceeding the conventional significance threshold of 0.05. These results suggest that the associations between these gut microbiota and hypertrophic scars may not be robust across different analytical approaches. Detailed results of the reverse MR analysis are provided in Supplementary Table 3.
        Cochran’s Q statistic, and MR-Egger intercept test indicated no heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy in this MR analysis, and no single SNP seriously violated GM’s overall impact on hypertrophic scar in the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis (Supplementray Table 4, and 5).

        Effect of immune cell traits on hypertrophic Scar
        Before FDR correction, we found a causal association of 33 immune cell traits with possible effects on hypertrophic scar (Fig. 5.). After FDR correction, we detected protective effects of 14 immune cell traits on hypertrophic scar with the IVW approach (Supplementray Table 6), they’re IgD- CD38- B cell %B cell (IVW: OR = 0.847, 95% CI [0.731, 0.982], P = 0.028), CD11c + HLA DR + + monocyte Absolute Count (IVW: OR = 0.878, 95% CI [0.776, 0.994], P = 0.040), IgD- CD27- B cell %B cell (IVW: OR = 0.891, 95% CI [0.798, 0.995], P = 0.041), CD25 on IgD- CD27- B cell (IVW: OR = 0.894, 95% CI [0.804, 0.994], P = 0.039), CD8 + T cell %T cell (IVW: OR = 0.894, 95% CI [0.824, 0.970], P = 0.007), HLA DR + + monocyte %monocyte (IVW: OR = 0.903, 95% CI [0.830, 0.982], P = 0.017), HLA DR on CD14 + CD16- monocyte (IVW: OR = 0.908, 95% CI [0.848, 0.971], P = 0.005), HLA DR on CD14 + monocyte (IVW: OR = 0.911, 95% CI [0.849, 0.976], P = 0.008), CD20 on IgD + CD38 + B cell (IVW: OR = 0.911, 95% CI [0.851, 0.976], P = 0.008), PDL-1 on CD14- CD16 + monocyte (IVW: OR = 0.916, 95% CI [0.845, 0.992], P = 0.030), CD28 + CD45RA- CD8dim T cell %CD8dim T cell (IVW: OR = 0.941, 95% CI [0.886, 0.977], P = 0.004), Effector Memory CD8 + T cell (IVW: OR = 0.932, 95% CI [0.876, 0.991], P = 0.025), CD25 + + CD45RA- CD4 not regulatory T cell %CD4 + T cell (IVW: OR = 0.940, 95% CI [0.886, 0.997], P = 0.040) and CD45 on Immature Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (IVW: OR = 0.942, 95% CI [0.889, 0.998], P = 0.044) (Fig. 4.)

This visualizes the findings from the MR analysis regarding the role of various immune cell genotypes in modifying the risk of hypertrophic scar, the effect sizes and confidence intervals are plotted for each immune cell genotypes that elevate the risk of hypertrophic scar are marked in red, whereas those that mitigate the risk are shown in blue. This figure underscores the complex interplay between immune regulation and hypertrophic scar pathogenesis.

        In addition, genetically predicted 9 immune cell traits would increase the risk of hypertrophic scar, they are HLA DR on CD14 + CD16 + monocyte (IVW: OR = 1.040, 95% CI [1.001, 1.080], P = 0.044), Memory B cell Absolute Count (IVW: OR = 1.056, 95% CI [1.001, 1.114], P = 0.044), CD25 on CD45RA- CD4 not regulatory T cell (IVW: OR = 1.077, 95% CI [1.020, 1.138], P = 0.007), CD24 on IgD + CD38 + B cell (IVW: OR = 1.100, 95% CI [1.030, 1.174], P = 0.004), SSC-A on Natural Killer (IVW: OR = 1.102, 95% CI [1.008, 1.205], P = 0.033), PDL-1 on CD14- CD16- (IVW: OR = 1.102, 95% CI [1.024, 1.187], P = 0.010), CD25 + + CD4 + T cell %T cell (IVW: OR = 1.104, 95% CI [1.016, 1.200], P = 0.020), CD16-CD56 on Natural Killer (IVW: OR = 1.113, 95% CI [1.034, 1.198], P = 0.004), and T cell Absolute Count (IVW: OR = 1.156, 95% CI [1.047, 1.276], P = 0.004) (Fig. 4.)
        Cochran’s Q statistic-derived p values based on IVW and MR Egger methods were more significant than 0.05, hinting no apparent heterogeneity was found, the MR-Egger intercepts test was not statistically significant, indicating no horizontal pleiotropy, and the leave-one-out analysis showed that removing a particular SNP would not change the causal estimates (Supplementray Table 7, and 8).

        Effect of GM on immune cell traits
        Previously, we identified 5 gut microbiotas as well as 23 immune cell traits vital to hypertrophic scar. Then, we investigated the causal role of 3 genera and 2 species on 36 immune cell traits. The MR analysis after FDR correction revealed that genus Coprococcus1genus Coprococcus1 was highly associated with CD24 on IgD + CD38 + B cell (OR = 0.767, 95% CI [0.611, 0.964], P = 0.023), and we also found that genus Adlercreutziagenus Adlercreutzia was highly associated with CD8 + T cell %T cell (OR = 0.742, 95% CI [0.573, 0.961], P = 0.024) (Supplementray Table 9). No heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy were observed, and a particular SNP did not drive causal estimates (Supplementray Table 10, and 11).
      
      
        Multiple testing correction
        After applying the FDR correction using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, all p-values from the Mendelian randomization analyses were adjusted. The corrected p-value threshold for significance was set at 0.05. Following the FDR correction, in addition to the significant difference results mentioned above, the other remaining all p-values for the associations between gut microbiota, immune cell traits, and hypertrophic scar risk were greater than 0.05. This indicates that the initial findings did not retain statistical significance after accounting for multiple comparisons. Therefore, while the initial results suggested potential associations, the FDR correction highlights the need for cautious interpretation and further validation in larger cohorts or through additional studies.
      
      
        Mediation effect of GM on hypertrophic scar
        The mediation effect of B cell-activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) on CD20- CD38- B cell in the causal pathway from genus Subdoligranulum to hypertrophic scar was 0.034 (95% CI [0.002, 0.066]; P = 0.004), accounting for 7.60% of the total effect. The mediation effect of CD24 on IgD + CD38 + B cell in the causal pathway from genus Coprococcus 1 to hypertrophic scar was − 0.015 (95% CI [-0.029, -0.001]; P = 0.023), accounting for 6.70% of the total effect. The mediation effect of CD8 + T cell %T cell in the causal pathway from genus Adlercreutzia to hypertrophic scar was 0.075 (95% CI [0.017, 0.133]; P = 0.024), accounting for 10.10% of the total effect (Table 1). Figure 5 shows the results of this section reported in OR format (Fig. 5).

      Discussion
      Hypertrophic scars are a common problem following skin injuries and healing beyond standard parameters. Such scars often exhibit an excessive proliferation of connective tissue40. Recent research has illuminated a significant interaction between the gut and skin, manifesting in the regulation of host metabolism, immunity41, inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuroendocrine functions42 by the microbiota and its respective metabolites. The interplay between the immune and neuroendocrine systems may be governing the communication pathways linking the skin and gut, thereby modulating the homeostasis between them. In the present study, we hypothesize that the gut microbiota influences the formation of hypertrophic scars through immune cell-mediated mechanisms. We found associations between 5 microbiota germs, 23 immune cell characteristics, and hypertrophic scar risk using Mendelian randomization and two-step methodological approaches. Moreover, we identified three immune cell traits that appear to mediate the onset of hypertrophic scars in specific gut microbiota, despite accompanying the potential for false positives. These findings deliver genomic evidence that enhances our understanding of the underlying mechanisms in hypertrophic scar formation and identifies possible therapeutic targets for intervention.
      Our study represents the first to identify a positive correlation between HS risk and the presence of Adlercreutzia, Fusicatenibacter and Subdoligranulum genes. Adlercreutzia is a gram-positive, strictly anaerobic bacterium43 known to have potentially beneficial effects and immunoregulatory properties6. Two extant Mendelian randomization studies44,45 have observed the protective influence of the Intestiimonas genus in repressing HS formation. Additionally, Chen et al.‘s paper44 suggested Ruminococcus 2 as a beneficial factor against HS, identifying the causal influence of five bacterial taxa on keloid formation. Leveraging 16 S rRNA gene sequencing technology and molecular biology methods, our research unveils - for the first time at a genomic level - gut microbiota promoting HS. An increased abundance of the gene Adlercreutzia has been linked to the onset of various diseases in a dysbacterial model46–48. Within human trials, an increase in Adlercreutzia has been associated with reductions in insulin resistance and diabetes risk49,50, suggesting it plays a potentially beneficial role in negating disease development. However, current literature primarily concentrates on Adlercreutzia’s role in the digestive, endocrine, and nervous systems51, few studies focus on its involvement in skin disease. Previous research52 reported a high abundance of Faecalibacterium in the gut environment of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients, coupled with the observation that dysbiosis within AD patients was mitigated following Dupilumab treatment, the rise in Faecalibacterium abundance acting as a significant marker53. Climent et al.54 also found gut Faecalibacterium changes in AD patients were associated with probiotic treatment response, with a higher relative abundance observed in psoriasis55–57 and acne vulgaris patients58, suggesting Faecalibacterium’s potential protective effect in the prevention of some inflammatory skin diseases. Supplementally, the most recent studies6,59,60 suggested that genus Subdoligranulum ans the secretome components from Fusicatenibacter prausnitzii Strain A2-165 may alleviate skin wound inflammation, indirectly signifying Subdoligranulum’s and Fusicatenibacter’s potential protective role in skin pathologies. The foundational stage of HS formation is representative of the body’s autonomous skin repair action. Our findings suggest that alterations in the abundance of specific gut microbiota could instigate changes in the skin under varying pathological circumstances. Consequently, Adlercreutzia, Fusicatenibacter and Subdoligranulum could emerge as promising targets for cutaneous pathophysiological alteration exploration.
      Our research also identified family Clostridiaceae1 and genus Coprococcus 1 as protective considerations concerning hypertrophic scar onset, aligning with Huidi et al.‘s findings6. ‌Clostridiaceae are primarily related to the skin in terms of their potential for infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues60‌. They can infect the skin through wounds, causing diseases such as sporotrichosis, Analysis of blood and fecal samples from 29 skin melanoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors revealed a strong association between high Clostridiaceae1 intestinihominis abundance and immunotherapy failure61. Nonetheless, current scholarly literature on ‌Clostridiaceae’s role in skin diseases remains limited. Prior studies have linked increased abundance of Barnesiella with disease alleviation in contexts such as fatty liver62, chronic hepatic encephalopathy63, colitis64, and chronic kidney disease65 when evidenced in rat and broiler chicken models. However, concurrent variations in other microbial communities complicate the interpretation of ‌their individual impact on disease progression or amelioration. Therefore, our study offers novel insights into the potential association between HS development and specific gut microbiota, thereby establishing an important foundation for future research in this area.
      Our research discovered a negative correlation between HS risk and 14 immune cell genotypes. Simultaneously, a positive correlation was observed with 9 other immune cell genotypes. In these correlations, T cells and their subsets played a significant role. Specifically, five T cell subset genotypes showed a negative correlation with HS risk, whereas seven other T cell subpopulation genotypes were positively correlated with it. These findings highlight the differential roles of various T lymphocytes in HS formation. During wound healing, a surge of local damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and related chemokines occur, leading helper T (Th) cells to congregating at the injury site66. This process then incentivizes Th1 cells to secrete DAMPs, IFN-γ, and IL-12, facilitating collagen breakdown and remodeling67,68. Notably, Th1 cells can also activate Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS), promoting Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM) degradation and fibrosis inhibition68–70. Conversely, Th2 cells, which secrete cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, etc., are observed to induce skin tissue fibrosis when these cytokine expressions increase, potentially resulting in the formation of HS. Tredget et al.71 confirmed that serum levels of Th2 cell-derived cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10) were significantly increased in HS patients, while Th1 cell-derived IFN - γ and IL-12 levels decreased. This highlights the crucial role of Th2 and its cytokines in post-injury HS formation and development. Furthermore, our study showed that levels of CD3 on CD39 + resting CD4 regulatory T cells and CD3 on CD4 regulatory T cells were negatively correlated with the risk of HS, reinforcing the role of various T lymphocytes during different stages of HS formation.
      Regulatory T cells (Treg), which are abundant in the skin, maintain peripheral immune tolerance by inhibiting other effector T cells, exhibiting immunosuppressive effects. This function directly influences collagen deposition and inhibits processes of wound repair, healing, and hypertrophic scar (HS) formation and proliferation72. Apart from directly regulating fibroblasts, Treg cells also interact with other T lymphocytes73, thereby playing a role in indirectly regulating collagen deposition and subsequent HS formation, specifically inhibiting these processes73. Dendritic epidermal T cells (DETCs), a subtype of gamma delta T cells, are unique as their receptors can specifically identify an unknown antigen or co-stimulatory molecule expressed during stress, damage, and by keratinocytes, leading to their activation74. DETCs secrete various cytokines, growth factors, and chemokines, such as keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) -1 and − 2, IGF-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-17 A, GM-CSF, IFN - γ, TNF - α, and lymphocyte chemokines74–76. This secretion profile promotes interactions between DETCs and surrounding cells: keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, other epidermal cells, and various inflammatory cells. These interactions induce effective epidermal cell division77, facilitate the survival and proliferation of keratinocytes, and drive migration of other inflammatory cells (neutrophils, macrophages, etc.)78, thereby initiating and magnifying the inflammatory response in the damaged area. This series of interactions and responses promote tissue repair, vascular regeneration processes, and possibly even HS formation79,80. Previous research confirmed that DETCs also promote the migration of macrophages to wound sites, contributing to inflammatory reactions and potentially leading to poor wound healing outcomes81. Consequently, gamma delta T cells may instigate the formation of HS. In our study, we established a significant positive correlation between T cell absolute count, T cell percentage within total lymphocytes, and the emergence of HS. Overall, these findings reflect that T cells have a propensity to promote excessive wound healing, leading to the formation of HS.
      We also found that among the levels of HLA DR + + monocyte %monocyte, HLA DR on CD14 + CD16- monocyte, and HLA DR on CD14 + monocyte, there was a negative correlation with the risk of HS. Conversely, the levels of HLA DR on CD14 + CD16 + monocytes were positively correlated with the risk of HS. Macrophages, which originate from monocytes, play a vital part in wound repair. The significance of these cells and their cytokines in this process has been underscored in recent research. Studies have found that inhibiting the activation of macrophages or targeting cytokines secreted by macrophages can ease inflammation and prevent scar formation. Hence, monocytes, macrophages, and their subsets all seem to play pivotal roles in the development of HS.
      B lymphocytes, which develop and differentiate from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) found in the bone marrow, not only secrete antibodies but also produce a variety of cytokines and growth factors integral to the immune response during wound healing82. Our study discovered a negative correlation between IgD- CD38- B cell %B cell, IgD- CD27- B cell %B cell, CD25 on IgD- CD27- B cell, CD20 on IgD + CD38 + B cell and HS risk. A positive correlation was found with Memory B cell Absolute Count, CD24 on IgD + CD38 + B cell and HS risk. Interestingly, one study found only minor B-cell infiltration during the process of acne scarring83. However, Smith et al.‘s research84 indicated that the transformation growth factor beta derived from B cells could stimulate the activation of inflammatory macrophages, contributing to fibrosis in hidradenitis suppurativa. These results seem to suggest a potential role of B cells in accelerating tissue fibrosis. Sîrbulescu et al.85 also observed that the secondary local application of purified mature and naive B220 (+)/CD19 (+)/IgM (+)/IgD (+) B cells improved acute wound healing in diabetic mice. In conclusion, diverse immune cell genotypes are involved, to varying degrees, in the process of damaged skin remodeling. This implicates that future research should concentrate on unveiling the mechanisms of HS formation and the development of targeted therapeutic drugs relating to it. Crucially, our study also revealed, for the first time, the mediating role of three immune cell genotypes in the occurrence of HS induced by genus Subdoligranulum, genus Coprococcus 1 and genus Adlercreutzia. This discovery offers new insights into the mechanisms of HS formation, the associated immune regulatory signaling pathways in scar formation, and provides additional theoretical support for the gut-skin axis theory.
      
        Strengths
        With the advancement of metabolomics, transcriptomics, microbiology, and other omics research methods, precision medicine has seen rapid development. Our study, led with an innovative two - step MR approach, analyzed the potential correlation among gut microbiota, immune cells, and hypertrophic scar occurrence. The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining skin homeostasis and contributing to the pathogenesis of skin diseases through intricate immune mechanisms. Our research has several notable strengths. Firstly, we employed a robust two - step, two - sample MR method, which leverages genetic variants as instrumental variables to establish causal relationships. This approach provides a reliable way to infer causality and mitigate the impact of confounding factors. Secondly, our study is based on large - scale GWAS data, including 18,340 European individuals for gut microbiota, 3,757 European adults for immune cells, and 424,907 European population for hypertrophic scars. The substantial sample sizes not only increase the statistical power of our analysis but also ensure the generalizability of our results within the European demographic. Thirdly, we conducted a comprehensive sensitivity analysis, including Cochran’s Q test for heterogeneity, MR - Egger intercept test for horizontal pleiotropy, and Leave - one - out analysis for potential outliers. These analyses collectively strengthen the reliability of our causal inferences. Lastly, our study provides novel insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the formation of hypertrophic scars by identifying specific gut microbiota taxa and immune cell genotypes that mediate the causal pathways, laying the groundwork for future research aimed at exploring new therapeutic targets and preventive strategies.
      
      
        Limitations
        Nevertheless, this study has several limitations. First, the data section in the FinnGen project did not undergo quality checks, which might impact the reliability of diagnoses. It also inadequately controlled for age or other factors among patients86. Additionally, the entire study population was of European descent. Hence, it is crucial to evaluate the applicability of our research results to specific ethnic groups. Differences in the distribution of genetic variations between varying ethnic or racial groups could lead to population stratification and biased research results. Future research should consider a more diverse population to enhance the generalizability of the results. Although we set a strict significance threshold P < 5 × 10− 8 based on the general standard of GWAS, in the actual study, due to the relatively small sample size, this threshold may lead to some real associations not being detected, thus increasing the risk of false negative results. In addition, in order to find potential associations as much as possible in exploratory analysis, we have appropriately relaxed the threshold, which may help to find more potential associations, but may also increase the risk of false positive results. Although we used a variety of methods to verify and evaluate the reliability of the association found in the subsequent analysis, such as a variety of MR methods, sensitivity analysis and multiple test correction, these methods can not completely eliminate the possibility of false positive or false negative results. In particular, after multiple test correction, the p value of many results exceeded the threshold of 0.05, which showed that these results were no longer statistically significant after strict correction. In addition, the sample size of the current study may not be sufficient to provide sufficient statistical power to detect small effects, especially when complex traits and multifactor interactions are involved. This further emphasizes the importance of increasing sample size and using more accurate genetic tool variables in future research, so as to improve the statistical efficacy and reliability of research.
        In the current study, we employed the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to adjust p-values from Mendelian randomization analyses via FDR correction, with a significance threshold of 0.05. Post-correction, all p-values for the associations among gut microbiota, immune cell traits, and hypertrophic scar risk surpassed 0.05, indicating the majority of the initial significant findings were no longer statistically significant after multiple comparisons adjustment. This outcome underscores several crucial aspects regarding the study’s limitations and the necessity for a more reserved interpretation of the results. Firstly, the application of FDR correction, while essential for minimizing false positives, may reduce statistical power and thereby increase the likelihood of false negatives. This means that some genuine associations might have been obscured due to the stringent correction method, especially when the expected effect sizes are small or the sample size is insufficient to provide adequate statistical power. The relatively modest sample size in our study could be a contributing factor to the non-significant results after correction. Given the complexity of the relationships between gut microbiota, immune cells, and hypertrophic scarring, larger sample sizes are likely needed to detect true associations with sufficient power. Moreover, the genetic instruments used in MR analysis may not perfectly capture the causal effects due to potential pleiotropy or weak instrument bias, which could further influence the significance of the results. These limitations imply that while our initial findings hint at potential links between specific gut microbiota, immune cell traits, and hypertrophic scar risk, they should be viewed as exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive. Future research should aim to replicate these findings in larger and more diverse cohorts to validate the observed associations. Additionally, incorporating more precise genetic instruments, employing alternative analytical approaches to address pleiotropy, and combining longitudinal data with functional experiments could provide deeper insights into the causal pathways and biological mechanisms underlying the development of hypertrophic scars.
        What‘s more, there is still a concern in this study about sample overlap between the GWAS studies for exposure and outcomes, it’s worth noting that even if there was a certain degree of sample overlap that couldn’t be completely eliminated, the nature of our analysis might still make it less likely to significantly affect the results. The genetic variants we focused on have relatively strong and consistent associations with the exposure and outcome traits. Their effects are generally considered to be relatively independent of each other in terms of the genetic architecture, so a partial overlap in samples might not substantially distort the estimated causal relationships. Moreover, the large sample sizes of the GWAS themselves provide a certain degree of robustness, making it less probable for a small proportion of overlapping samples to have a remarkable impact on the overall findings. Lastly, while MR presumes a linear relationship between exposure and outcome, the actual relationship could be more complex and involve non-linear relationships and interactions with other environmental and genetic factors87. While our study provides insights into the associations between gut microbiota and hypertrophic scarring at the family and genus levels, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of taxonomic resolution. Analyzing microbiota at higher taxonomic levels (e.g., genus or family) may obscure important functional differences between species. Previous research35 has highlighted that species or strain-level identification is necessary to obtain more accurate insights into the functional roles of specific microbial taxa. Future studies should focus on species or strain-level analysis to better understand the precise mechanisms by which gut microbiota influence hypertrophic scarring. This would help in identifying specific microbial strains that could serve as potential therapeutic targets. Future MR research should carefully consider the potential nonlinear and interactive effects between GM and HS, focusing on finding different treatment strategies. The application of modern pharmacology and life science techniques should be extended to further explore the potential of regulating gut microbiota and subsequent immune responses to prevent and treat HS in clinical trials and basic research.
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      Our research suggests that specific gut microbiota and immune cells, including the genus Subdoligranulum and BAFF-R on CD20- CD38- B cells, may potentially influence the development of hypertrophic scars. The presence of genus Coprococcus 1 appears to be associated with corresponding levels of CD24 on IgD + CD38 + B cells, while the presence of genus Adlercreutzia seems to be linked to CD8 + T cell %T cells, which might mitigate the risk of hypertrophic scars. However, after applying the FDR correction, most statistical significance of these associations was not retained, indicating that our initial findings may be prone to false positives. Therefore, our results should be interpreted with caution and considered as preliminary evidence rather than definitive conclusions. The selective alteration of certain gut microbiota’s abundance and modulation of specific immune cells could represent promising strategies to preempt the onset of hypertrophic scars, but these hypotheses require further validation in larger cohorts and through additional studies.

Title: Predictors of Pregnancy after Artificial Insemination in Women with
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome

Abstract: ObjectivePolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in
women of reproductive age, being one of the main causes of infertility.
Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is an important marker of ovarian
reserve and has been proposed as an alternative criterion for the diagnosis
of PCOS. This study verifies whether AMH and body mass index (BMI) values
are predictors of pregnancy in infertile women with PCOS undergoing
artificial insemination (AI), a less invasive and painless technique of
assisted reproductive technologies (ART).MethodsThis retrospective observational study involved 220 women with PCOS who
underwent AI between 2010 and 2022. Participants were categorized into three
groups based on BMI and serum AMH levels. To categorize the three AMH
classes, the 25th (4.08ng/mL) and 75th (8.99ng/mL) AMH percentiles were
defined as cut-offs, and the words ‘low’, ‘middle’, and ‘high’ were utilized
to define the groups.ResultsThere was a tendency towards a decrease in reproductive outcomes (number of
inseminations with positive human-chorionic gonadotropin, number of live
births, and number of term births) with an increase in the BMI value. All of
these outcomes were also slightly higher in women with ‘middle’ AMH levels
compared to women with ‘low’ and ‘high’ AMH. However, none of these results
were statistically significant.ConclusionsThis study suggests BMI may be an important predictive factor for pregnancy
and there appears to be a range of biological normality for AMH values,
where ‘low’ and ‘high’ levels of this hormone could constitute a marker of
poor reproductive prognosis, in women with PCOS undergoing AI.

Body: INTRODUCTION
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine condition in women of
reproductive age, affecting them from adolescence to menopause (Gao et al., 2022; Teede et al., 2023). It has a
prevalence of 8-13% and accounts for almost 80% of cases of anovulatory infertility
(Gao et al., 2022; Sivanandy & Ha, 2023; Teede et al., 2023). This syndrome is
characterized by an increase in the pulsatility of gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH), which stimulates the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH), which in turn
increases the production of androgens by theca cells, resulting in a high
luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) ratio (Sadeghi et al., 2022; Teede et al., 2023). Women
with PCOS have a diverse clinical presentation, including
gynecological/reproductive, metabolic, endocrine, and psychiatric features (Gao et al., 2022; Rudnicka et al., 2021). In
terms of gynecology, these women may experience oligomenorrhea, amenorrhea, and/or
infertility (di Clemente et al.,
2022; Gao et al.,
2022; Teede et al.,
2023). Hirsutism, acne, and alopecia are endocrine symptoms and
indicators of clinical hyperandrogenism (di Clemente
et al., 2022; Gao
et al., 2022; Teede
et al., 2023). Regardless of age or body mass index
(BMI) at the time of diagnosis, PCOS increases the risk of cardiovascular disease,
high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, metabolic
dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and obstructive sleep apnea
(di Clemente et al.,
2022; Gao et al.,
2022; Teede et al.,
2023). Women with PCOS are more likely to develop depression and anxiety
disorders, as well as endometrial hyperplasia and cancer (Teede et al., 2023). All of these problems
worsen the patients’ infertility. Furthermore, pregnant women with this syndrome are
at a higher risk of miscarriage, gestational diabetes, hypertension, fetal growth
restriction, preterm birth, and cesarean section (Gao et al., 2022).
      This pathology is diagnosed using the 2003 Rotterdam criteria (Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group,
2004), which require the presence of two of the following three criteria:
(1) oligoor anovulation, (2) clinical/laboratory hyperandrogenism, and (3)
ultrasound-detected polycystic ovaries (Sivanandy
& Ha, 2023). Before making a clear diagnosis of PCOS, other endocrine
illnesses (thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
Cushing’s syndrome, among others) must be ruled out (Collée et al., 2021). Regarding criterion (1),
the definition of oligomenorrhea differs according to the woman’s reproductive stage
(Teede et al., 2023).
Thus, oligomenorrhea is physiological around menarche and menopause; if it occurs
1-3 years after menarche, it is defined as menstrual cycles longer than 45 days; if
it occurs 3 years or more after menarche, it is defined as cycles longer than 35
days or when women have fewer than 8 normal-length cycles per year (Gao et al., 2022; Teede et al., 2023). Regarding
criterion (2), hyperandrogenism can appear as hirsutism or acne; however, when these
signs are mild or absent, a biochemical examination can be performed by measuring
total and free testosterone levels (Gao et
al., 2022). Finally, criterion (3) requires using ultrasound
to detect 20 or more follicles in at least one ovary, with the transvaginal
technique being the most accurate (Gao et
al., 2022; Teede et
al., 2023).
      Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a peptide produced by the granulosa cells of
pre-antral and small antral ovarian follicles from the 36th week post-conception
until menopause, and it is an essential marker of ovarian reserve (di Clemente et al., 2022;
Rudnicka et al., 2021;
Teede et al., 2023). AMH
levels can be tested in both serum and follicular fluid and vary with age and BMI
(Gao et al., 2022; Moreira et al., 2023; Teede et al., 2023). After a
brief perinatal surge, AMH levels stay low until they peak at puberty and then
gradually decline throughout reproductive life until menopause (di Clemente et al., 2022;
Rudnicka et al., 2021;
Sadeghi et al., 2022;
Sivanandy & Ha, 2023). Furthermore,
serum AMH appears to vary among women with a higher BMI (Gao et al., 2022), and the link between these
two factors is not consistent between studies. In women with regular menstrual
cycles, AMH values are lower in the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase.
However, this variation is not significant and AMH can be measured on any day,
unlike FSH and LH, which must be assessed at the beginning of the follicular phase
(Teede et al., 2023).
AMH regulates sexual differentiation by suppressing the development of
Müllerian ducts in male fetuses (Rudnicka
et al., 2021; Teede
et al., 2023). The absence of AMH in female fetuses
allows Müllerian ducts to mature and give rise to the fallopian tubes,
uterus, cervix, and upper part of the vagina (Teede
et al., 2023). This hormone also controls ovarian
folliculogenesis by choosing only one dominant follicle and limiting the recruitment
of other primordial follicles via a paracrine mechanism (Rudnicka et al., 2021). AMH is also important
for raising LH secretion and androgen synthesis while decreasing expression of the
LH receptor and aromatase, an enzyme that converts androgens into estrogens (di Clemente et al., 2022;
Rudnicka et al.,
2021).
      Serum AMH levels in women with PCOS are 2 to 4 times greater than in women without
PCOS, owing to an increased number of pre-antral follicles and small antral
follicles, as well as AMH upregulation by granulosa cells (di Clemente et al., 2022). This explains the
high LH/FSH ratio and the large levels of androgens in these women, and also the
possibility of a positive feedback loop between AMH, LH, and GnRH in PCOS (Rudnicka et al., 2021).
Because of the close relationship between serum AMH levels and preantral and antral
ovarian follicle counts on ultrasound, AMH has been advocated as an alternative
diagnostic criterion, particularly in circumstances when ultrasound examination of
the ovaries is challenging (Rudnicka et
al., 2021). Recent research shows that replacing criterion
(3) of the Rotterdam criteria with serum AMH levels can effectively predict the
existence of PCOS with a high sensitivity (78 to 100%) and specificity (88 to 100%)
(Rudnicka et al., 2021;
Teede et al., 2023). The
most commonly proposed AMH cohort point in Caucasians is 4.9 ng/mL (Rudnicka et al., 2021),
however other research has already attempted to create alternative cut-offs for the
ideal AMH value according to the outcomes of IVF techniques in these patients facing
infertility (Vale-Fernandes et al.,
2023a).
      The initial step in treating PCOS in women is to lose weight and limit calorie intake
by regular exercise and a fatand sugar-free diet (Sadeghi et al., 2022). A 5-10% weight loss can
normalize the menstrual cycle and restore fertility (Collée et al., 2021; Sadeghi et al., 2022). In the second line,
medicines such as combined oral contraceptives, antidiabetics (metformin,
liraglutide, orlistat), and anti-androgens (spironolactone, finasteride) can be
administered alone or in combination, depending on the patient’s goals (Gao et al., 2022; Sadeghi et al., 2022).
Bariatric surgery might be viewed as the final stage in weight loss (Gao et al., 2022).
      If weight loss alone is ineffective for infertility treatment, ovulation induction is
used, with letrozole or clomiphene citrate as first-line medications (Gao et al., 2022). In the
second phase, gonadotropins or ovarian drilling are recommended, and in the final
phase, assisted reproductive technologies (ART) (Gao
et al., 2022). In vitro fertilization (IVF) with
single embryo transfer was the primary technique used; however, in recent years,
some clinical trials have focused on a less invasive, less expensive, and painless
technique, artificial insemination (AI) or intrauterine insemination (IUI), and have
shown that it can be used as a first step before proceeding to IVF (Sivanandy & Ha, 2023). Approximately 98% of
pregnancies occurred in the first three AI cycles (Sivanandy & Ha, 2023).
      AI is an ART approach that allows sperm to cross natural barriers in the female
vaginal canal (Allahbadia, 2017; Bayer et al., 2018). AI can be
conducted with or without prior ovarian stimulation, and in the vast majority of
cases, this is done to boost the technique’s success rate (Allahbadia, 2017). After ovulation is triggered, a vaginal
ultrasound is done on the 12th day of the menstrual cycle to monitor the size of the
ovarian follicles (Bayer et al.,
2018). When the follicle reaches 18 mm, recombinant-human chorionic
gonadotropin (r-HCG) is given, and insemination is scheduled 36 hours later (Bayer et al., 2018). On the day
of insemination, a semen sample is collected and then cleaned and processed to
remove bacteria and prostaglandins while also concentrating the sperm (Bayer et al., 2018). AI is
performed using a speculum, which facilitates the insertion of a catheter into the
uterine cavity and allows prepared sperm to flow through, followed by a pregnancy
test 14 days later (Bayer et al.,
2018).
      The aim of this study is to determine if AMH and BMI levels are predictors of
conception in PCOS-infertile women undergoing AI.
    
    
      MATERIALS AND METHODS
      
        Scientific research
        The electronic databases Pubmed, ScienceDirect, and SciELO were searched for
relevant studies using the search terms “PCOS” or “Polycystic Ovary Syndrome” in
combination with “Intrauterine Insemination” or “IUI”, “artificial
inseminations” or “AI”, “Assisted Reproductive Technologies” or “ART”, “Body
Mass Index” or “BMI”, and “Anti-Müllerian Hormone” or “AMH”. Before
reading the articles in full, the title and abstract were used to choose them,
with no language restrictions.
      
      
        Study design
        This is a retrospective and observational study carried out at the Center for
Medically Assisted Procreation (CPMA, in Portuguese), a public ART center, of
the Centro Materno- Infantil do Norte Dr. Albino Aroso (CMIN) and approved by
the Ethics Committee of the Unidade Local de Saúde de Santo
António / Institute of Biomedical Sciences Abel Salazar (ULSSA/ICBAS),
Porto, Portugal (Reference - 2023.278[239-DEFI/230-CE]).
      
      
        Selection criteria
        All women diagnosed with PCOS using the Rotterdam criteria (Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group,
2004) and undergoing AI between January 1, 2010, and December 31,
2022, were included, for a total of 220 women with PCOS and 359 AI cycles. In
all AI cycles conducted at our center none of the clinical cases presented any
male factor infertility - all individuals presented a normal sperm count in the
initial evaluation according to the WHO criteria (Cooper et al., 2010). At our center, AI is
only performed on women who have one to two good-sized follicles during
stimulation; otherwise, if a greater number of follicles are observed, the cycle
is canceled, and contraception is recommended, as we do not convert these cycles
to IVF due to specific access rules and a waiting list for IVF treatments at the
public centers. Additionally, while few women have only one patent fallopian
tube, if this occurs and stimulation is detected on that side, the cycle is
canceled. Intervention was ovarian stimulation and/or AI if post wash total
motile sperm count was > 8 million (Evans
et al., 2020). Mature follicles were defined as
≥ 14 mm as measured on the day of ovulation trigger (Evans et al., 2020).
Exclusion criteria included donor treatments and a probable diagnosis of PCOS
without matching the Rotterdam criteria, as well as the presence of
clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism caused by other factors than PCOS. The
data (age, BMI, FSH, LH, AMH, number of inseminations, pregnancies with positive
beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG), full-term pregnancies, and
miscarriages) were taken from the CMIN CPMA’s anonymized database. The study
participants were divided into three groups based on age, BMI, and serum AMH
levels. The following age groups were considered: class 1 (<31 years), class
2 (31-40 years), and class 3 (>40 years). BMI classification: class 1 (<25
kg/m2), class 2 (25-30 kg/m2), and class 3 (>30
kg/m2). To categorize the three AMH classes, the 25th (4.08
ng/mL) and 75th (8.99 ng/mL) AMH percentiles were defined as cut-offs, and the
words ‘low’, ‘middle’, and ‘high’ were utilized. Therefore, the ‘low’ group
comprises the AI cycles of women with AMH levels below the 25th percentile
(n=29), the ‘middle’ group comprises the AI cycles of women with AMH levels
between the 25th and 75th percentile (n=58) and the ‘high’ group comprises AI
cycles of women with AMH levels above the 75th percentile (n=29). These
classification categories ‘low’, ‘middle’, and ‘high’ are used only to simplify
the description of the results and allow for better comparison, so they are not
synonyms for biological normality.
      
      
        Outcomes
        The key outcome is the number of AI-induced pregnancies and live deliveries, as
well as their relationship to BMI and serum AMH levels. Pregnancies were
confirmed by testing serum β-HCG levels around 14 days after
insemination. Secondary outcomes include the number of miscarriages and
full-term deliveries.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Statistical analysis was carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences version 29 (IBM SPSS 29) software. Continuous variables were described
as mean±standard deviation, whereas categorical variables were
represented by the number of cases and percentages. Pearson’s Chi-square test
was employed to evaluate significance for categorical variables, while the ANOVA
test was used to check for variance homogeneity in continuous data. If the
result was negative, the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. Pearson’s correlation
was used to determine the degree of relationship between reproductive outcomes
in women with PCOS who underwent AI and BMI and serum AMH levels. A linear
correlation test was also run between the AMH classes, BMI, and age. A
p-value <0.05 indicated statistical significance
result.
      
    
    
      RESULTS
      A sample of 220 PCOS women who received a total of 359 AI cycles was examined. These
cycles produced 75 pregnancies, which equates to 20.89%. The sample included women
aged 21-41 years, with an average age of 31.45 years (±4.24) and a BMI of
25.86 kg/m2 (± 5.21). The average FSH and LH levels were 6.17
(± 1.68) mIU/mL and 8.90 (± 4.60) mIU/mL, respectively, with an LH/FSH
ratio of 1.48 (± 0.69). The average blood AMH level among these women was
7.30 ng/mL (± 5.10). Table 1 describes
the characteristics of the women in the sample.

      The women in the sample (n=220) were split based on their BMI and serum AMH levels.
In terms of BMI (Table 2), no statistically
significant differences were found between the traits and reproductive outcomes
examined and BMI. However, there was a trend towards fewer conceptions, live births,
and term births when the BMI increased.

      The sample’s age, BMI, and serum AMH values did not follow a normal distribution.
84.5% (n=186) of the women were under 31 years old, whereas 50% (n=110) had a normal
body weight (BMI<25 kg/m2).
      Despite 47.2% (n=104) AMH missing results, 13.2% (n=29) were below the 25th AMH
percentile (AMH≤4.08 ng/mL), 26.4% (n=58) between the 25th and 75th AMH
percentile, and 13.2% (n=29) above the 75th AMH percentile (AMH≥8.99
ng/mL).
      In this regard, a correlation study was performed, revealing a significant negative
association between BMI and FSH (r=-0.152; p=0.031). The remaining
associations were not statistically significant (Table 3).

Table 4 shows that women with PCOS and ‘low’
serum AMH levels are older and have a lower BMI, but this is not statistically
significant (p>0.05). However, women with ‘high’ AMH levels are
younger (p=0.018), and have a lower FSH value
(p=0.026), a higher LH value (‘middle’ vs. ‘high’:
p=0.018; ‘low’ vs. ‘high’:
p=0.025) and, subsequently, a higher LH/FSH ratio (‘middle’
vs. ‘high’: p=0.006; ‘low’
vs. ‘high’: p<0.001). Women with ‘middle’ AMH
levels had somewhat greater reproductive outcomes (number of AIs with positive
β-HCG, number of live births, number of miscarriages, and number of term
births) than those with ‘low’ or ‘high’ AMH levels, but there were no statistically
significant differences.

      Furthermore, there was a significant positive relationship between serum AMH levels,
serum LH levels, and the LH/FSH ratio (Table

blood AMH levels and age and serum FSH levels. There were no significant differences
found between serum AMH levels and BMI (r=0.126; p=0.177), the
number of AI cycles with positive β-HCG (r=0.026; p=0.783),
the number of births alive (r=0.049; p=0.598), or the number of
miscarriages (r=-0.061; p=0.515).

      DISCUSSION
      The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that ART be used as a last resort for
treating infertility in women with PCOS (Gao
et al., 2022). While the effectiveness of different
ART methods has been debated, AI is increasingly being used as a first step before
IVF. AI is considered less invasive, more affordable, and painless (Sivanandy & Ha, 2023), even though IVF
typically leads to better reproductive outcomes (Bayer et al., 2018). However, there is limited research
on how BMI and AMH levels affect the success of AI in women with PCOS, especially in
cases where ovulatory issues are present but sperm counts are normal.
      Women in this study had an average BMI over 25 kg/m2, indicating they were
above the normal weight range. Additionally, they exhibited high serum levels of LH
and AMH, along with an increased LH/FSH ratio. These findings are consistent with
existing literature on the physical and hormonal characteristics of PCOS women
(Sadeghi et al., 2022;
Teede et al., 2023). To
understand the role of BMI in shaping these hormonal changes, we examined findings
from other studies. Research indicates that there are significant differences in
FSH, LH, and the LH/FSH ratio between obese and non-obese women (Lal et al., 2017).
Specifically, a notable negative correlation exists between BMI and FSH levels in
our results as previously documented by another research group (Kiddy et al., 1990). However,
while some studies have found that overweight or obese women have lower LH levels
(Chen et al., 2018), our
study did not find this association. Similarly, we observed no significant
relationship between BMI and the LH/FSH ratio, which aligns with previous research
(Alnakash & Al-Tae’e, 2007; Saadia, 2020). The relationship between BMI,
LH, FSH, the LH/FSH ratio, and AMH in women with PCOS is complex. While there may be
some influence of BMI on hormonal levels, the inconsistencies across studies
highlight the need for more research. Future studies should focus on understanding
the factors that contribute to these relationships, such as insulin resistance and
inflammation, to improve treatment options for managing PCOS.
      BMI has been identified as a significant predictor of pregnancy outcomes, both in
natural conception and following ART (Aydin
et al., 2013; Chen
et al., 2018). Our investigation observed a trend
indicating a decline in the number of pregnancies as BMI increased; however, this
trend did not reach statistical significance. This finding aligns with the results
of previous studies that have reported similar outcomes (Guan et al., 2021; Sheng et al., 2017; Souter et al., 2011). Moreover, our results
corroborate existing literature that indicates no significant differences in live
birth rates or miscarriage rates associated with varying BMI levels (Guan et al., 2021; Sheng et al., 2017; Souter et al., 2011).These
findings contribute to the broader understanding of how BMI may modulate
reproductive outcomes, suggesting that other factors may play a more crucial role in
influencing pregnancy success in this population.
      AMH presents distinct advantages over other female hormones in reproductive
assessments, as its levels remain stable throughout the menstrual cycle, exhibit
minimal variability between cycles, and are less influenced by the operator’s skill
in measurement (Elgindy et al.,
2008). Consequently, evaluating serum AMH levels may serve as a reliable
reference for counseling women with PCOS regarding the prognosis of pregnancy
outcomes following AI (Li et al.,
2010). Our investigation revealed a significant inverse correlation
between AMH levels and age, which aligns with existing literature documenting the
gradual decline of AMH due to ovarian aging and subsequent deterioration of oocyte
quality (Bertone-Johnson et al.,
2018; de Kat et al.,
2016; Dondik et al.,
2017; Gunasheela et al.,
2021; Kruszyńska A, Słowińska-Srzednicka,
2017; Li et al.,
2010; Tal et al.,
2014). This decline in AMH is typically associated with an increase in
serum FSH levels, confirming the findings of both our study and earlier research
(Bhattacharya et al.,
2022; Desforges-Bullet et
al., 2010; Dewailly
et al., 2020; Guo
et al., 2021; Homburg et al., 2013; Li et al., 2010; Tal
et al., 2014; Xi
et al., 2012). Conversely, our study indicated a
positive association between serum AMH and LH levels, which is corroborated by
previous investigations (Bhattacharya et
al., 2022; Desforges-Bullet
et al., 2010; Dewailly et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2021; Homburg et al., 2013; Li et al., 2010; Lin
et al., 2011; Piouka
et al., 2009; Tal
et al., 2014; Vale-Fernandes et al., 2023a; Xi et al., 2012). Additionally, a positive
correlation was identified between AMH levels and the LH/FSH ratio. While this ratio
is commonly utilized in the diagnosis of PCOS (Le
et al., 2019; Tola
et al., 2018), its prognostic value for pregnancy
outcomes in women undergoing AI remains inadequately explored. Regarding the
relationship between BMI and serum AMH levels, our study found a non-significant
trend suggesting that women with lower AMH levels tended to have lower BMI. However,
this association is not universally acknowledged, as some studies report a positive
correlation (Dondik et al.,
2017), while others indicate a negative correlation (Cui et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2022; Kriseman et al., 2015; Vagios et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023). The
variability in findings may be influenced by differences in the age groups studied,
suggesting that age could act as a confounding variable in the relationship between
AMH and BMI. Overall, these findings underscore the importance of AMH as a potential
biomarker for predicting reproductive outcomes in women with PCOS undergoing ART,
particularly in the context of AI. Further research is essential to clarify the
implications of AMH levels in this population and to explore potential confounding
factors that may influence these relationships.
      AMH is widely recognized as a key biomarker for assessing ovarian reserve (di Clemente et al., 2022;
Rudnicka et al., 2021;
Teede et al., 2023), and
elevated levels of AMH may correlate with an increased risk of adverse reproductive
outcomes (Vale-Fernandes et al.,
2023a; Vale-Fernandes et
al., 2024). In our analysis, while we observed no
significant differences, women classified with ‘low’ and ‘high’ AMH levels
demonstrated slightly decreased rates of inseminations resulting in positive
β-HCG when compared to women with ‘middle’ AMH levels. In a study involving
360 infertile women from France without a diagnosis of PCOS, pregnancy rates
following a single cycle of AI were evaluated based on AMH percentiles.
Specifically, participants were stratified according to the 20th and 80th
percentiles of AMH, which correspond to approximately 1 ng/mL and 4.5 ng/mL,
respectively. The authors reported no statistically significant differences in
pregnancy rates among the various AMH groups (Lamazou et al., 2012). Conversely, another study
indicated that women with serum AMH levels equal to or exceeding 2.3 ng/mL
experienced significantly higher pregnancy rates compared to those with lower AMH
levels (Moro et al., 2016).
Furthermore, our data revealed that women with ‘middle’ AMH levels experienced a
marginally higher number of live births and miscarriages; however, these differences
were not statistically significant. This observation contrasts with findings from
other studies suggesting that higher AMH concentrations may be associated with an
improved likelihood of achieving a live birth (Stalzer et al., 2023). In the context of preterm birth,
existing literature indicates an elevated risk in women with PCOS (Boomsma et al., 2006; Kjerulff et al., 2011; Qin et al., 2013); however,
our investigation found no association between AMH levels and the incidence of term
deliveries. These results align with prior research that suggests a biological
spectrum of normalcy: ‘low’ AMH levels are indicative of diminished ovarian reserve,
while ‘high’ AMH levels may be associated with increased disease severity and poorer
reproductive prognosis (Guo et al.,
2021; La Marca et al.,
2004; Lin et al.,
2011; Piouka et al.,
2009; Sun et al.,
2021; Tal et al.,
2020; Tal et al.,
2014; Vale-Fernandes et
al., 2023a). One possible explanation for these findings is
that elevated AMH concentrations may lead to aberrant folliculogenesis, alterations
in endometrial receptivity, and placental dysfunction (Tal et al., 2020; Vale-Fernandes et al., 2024). Overall, our
findings contribute to the complex understanding of AMH as a prognostic biomarker in
reproductive outcomes for women undergoing AI, particularly those affected by PCOS.
Further longitudinal studies are warranted to elucidate the nuanced relationships
between AMH levels, ovarian reserve, and reproductive outcomes across diverse
populations.
      Despite the established biological reference range for AMH levels, numerous studies
have endeavored to define specific cut-off values for both the diagnosis of PCOS and
the assessment of reproductive prognosis. Our research group has previously reported
proposed cut-off thresholds for healthy women that may enhance ovarian response
following gamete donation (Oliveira et
al., 2023; Vale-Fernandes
et al., 2023b) and for infertile women undergoing
IVF treatments to predict poor and high response to stimulation (Reis et al., 2024). In the
context of IVF, several studies have identified cut-off levels of AMH that optimize
its diagnostic utility in women with PCOS. For instance, a study conducted in India
established a cut-off of 3.34 ng/mL, indicating a sensitivity of 98% and a
specificity of 93% for predicting ovarian response (Saikumar et al., 2013). Additionally, another
investigation determined that an AMH cut-off of 4.9 ng/mL exhibited the strongest
correlation between sensitivity and specificity (Wiweko et al., 2014). While there has been increasing
research into the diagnostic and prognostic roles of AMH in the context of IVF
cycles for women with PCOS, there remains a significant gap in knowledge regarding
its implications for AI. The present study represents a pioneering effort to explore
the relationship between serum AMH levels and reproductive outcomes in women with
PCOS undergoing AI. Given the importance of AMH as a potential biomarker in
reproductive medicine, further investigation is warranted to elucidate its
prognostic value in this specific setting.
      This study contains several limits and strengths. The use of percentiles rather than
absolute AMH scores improves the generalizability of the findings. The study’s
biggest limitation is its retrospective nature, which means that the analysis is
based on previously collected data, making it impossible to acquire more information
on specific variables. Furthermore, AMH levels were only routinely obtained starting
in 2017, limiting the sample size on this parameter (there is 47.27% missing AMH
values - out of the total sample of 220 participants, AMH values were documented and
assessed in 116 women). Another limitation is that the study was conducted in a
single public center with a predominantly Caucasian population, failing to account
for racial/ethnic differences in AMH levels, as well as variations caused by genetic
and environmental factors such as obesity, smoking, and vitamin D deficiency (Iliodromiti et al., 2013;
Tal & Seifer, 2013). This study was
conducted in a public center where AI treatments are restricted to women under the
age of 42, and IVF is limited to those under 40. Consequently, the sample population
is confined to a relatively narrow age range, which constrains the ability to
perform stratified analyses based on chronological age. The study did not address
the differences between having one or two growing follicles, which could introduce
selection analyses bias and covered both natural and stimulated insemination cycles,
but did not individually analyze the various ovulation-inducing drugs. Several
trials, however, have demonstrated that stimulation with clomiphene citrate,
letrozole, and gonadotropins was equally effective and safe in promoting conception
in women with PCOS (Huang et al.,
2018). Although all men met the minimum insemination criteria mentioned
in the methodology, a comparative analysis based on sperm profile was not carried
out, which constitutes a limitation to consider. All individuals presented a normal
sperm count in the initial evaluation according to the WHO criteria (Cooper et al., 2010) and
according some authors AI is a well-supported first-line treatment for moderate male
factor subfertility and is considered cost-effective (Ombelet et al., 2003). However, identifying
specific semen parameters that predict pregnancy outcomes after AI is challenging
due to inconsistencies in semen analysis standards and other influencing factors,
such as patient selection and ovarian stimulation methods (Ombelet et al., 2003). While research
indicates that strict sperm morphology criteria and inseminating motile sperm count
are critical for AI success, a definitive threshold for optimal semen quality
remains undetermined, although rates appear to decline with fewer than 5% normal
sperm and an inseminating motile sperm count below 1 million (Ombelet et al., 2003). A significant
limitation of the present study pertains to the nature of the data that can be
analyzed within the context of AI cycles. These cycles represent first-line
techniques in ART, characterized by their relatively straightforward and minimally
invasive nature. Consequently, specific details regarding oocyte and embryonic
characteristics remain unknown. Nevertheless, it is important to note that this
study encompasses a substantial cohort of treatments involving women diagnosed with
PCOS undergoing AI. The findings yield valuable insights into the reproductive
prognosis for this population, which often exhibits a poor reproductive outlook even
in the context of IVF treatments (Vale-Fernandes
et al., 2023a).
    
    
      CONCLUSION
      While this study did not find statistically significant results, it suggests a trend
where higher BMI is linked to fewer pregnancies in infertile women with PCOS
undergoing AI. This supports the idea that BMI could be an important predictor of
pregnancy outcomes, highlighting the need for continued weight loss efforts in this
group.
      This study further elucidates women with ‘low’ and ‘high’ AMH levels exhibit reduced
rates of conception and live births, although these findings did not achieve
statistical significance. It appears that there exists a median range of biological
normality concerning AMH levels. Consequently, one may infer that both ‘low’ and
‘high’ AMH levels may correlate with an unfavorable reproductive prognosis in women
with PCOS undergoing AI, consistent with our previous research findings in the
context of IVF (Vale-Fernandes et
al., 2023a).

Title: Effectiveness and Safety of Guselkumab in Patients With Moderate‐to‐Severe Plaque Psoriasis in Real‐World Practice in Korea: A Prospective, Multicenter, Observational, Postmarketing Surveillance Study

Abstract: ABSTRACTClinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of guselkumab in patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis. Real‐world evidence for guselkumab in Korea is needed to establish drug safety and effectiveness under real‐world practice in this population. This study assessed the effectiveness, safety, and drug survival of guselkumab in Korean patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis in a real‐world clinical setting. In this prospective, non‐interventional observational study conducted at 44 clinical centers in South Korea, adult patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis who would receive guselkumab per the product label were enrolled. Disease assessment was performed at visits 1 (baseline, week 0), 2 (approximately week 4), and 3–7 (approximately every 8 weeks after week 4, weeks 12–44). Between February 25, 2019 and March 25, 2022, 707 patients were enrolled and 562 (79.5%) had completed the 56‐week observation period. The proportions of patients with an absolute Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of ≤ 3, ≤ 2, or ≤ 1 reached maximums of 96.0%, 86.7%, and 59.0%, respectively, at visit 7. A significantly greater proportion of biologic‐naïve (vs. biologic‐experienced) patients achieved absolute PASI ≤ 3 by visits 5–7 (p = 0.001 at visit 7) and absolute PASI ≤ 2 by visits 6–7 (p = 0.0014 at visit 7). Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores decreased over time, with 64.1% of patients achieving DLQI 0/1 by visit 7; results were similar regardless of prior biologic therapy. The estimated drug‐survival rate at 1 year was 92.7%. Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 22.5% of patients, with an incidence rate of 42.1 per 100 patient years (PY); 14 serious AEs occurred in 13 (1.8%) patients, with an incidence rate (95% confidence interval) of 2.4 (1.2–3.7) per 100 PY. Guselkumab administered under approved label conditions was effective and well‐tolerated in Korean patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis in a real‐world clinical setting.

Body: 1
      Introduction
      Psoriasis is an immune‐mediated, chronic inflammatory disease that affects an estimated 125 million people, with a prevalence of 0.33%–0.6% globally [1]. In 2015, there were 233, 909 people in Korea with psoriasis, with an age‐ and sex‐standardized prevalence of 453 per 100 000; 23% of patients had moderate‐to‐severe disease [2]. The most common subtype is plaque psoriasis, characterized by sharply demarcated, erythematous, scaly plaques, which accounts for ~80%–90% of patients [2, 3]. Psoriasis is associated with a wide spectrum of comorbid conditions that are not limited to skin manifestations, such as psoriatic arthritis, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, chronic kidney diseases, and mental health diseases, thus affecting many aspects of patients' lives and severely impacting overall quality of life [1].
      Standard treatments for moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis, defined by 3% to > 10% of body surface area (BSA) involvement, include phototherapy, and systemic non‐biologic and biologic therapies [4, 5, 6]. Among these, biologic therapy has demonstrated a favorable benefit‐to‐risk ratio and represents a significant advancement in the treatment of psoriasis [6]. Currently, there are four classes of biologics, which include tumor necrosis factor‐α inhibitors, interleukin (IL)‐12/IL‐23 inhibitors, IL‐17 inhibitors, and IL‐23 inhibitors [6].
      Guselkumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the p19 subunit of IL‐23 and inhibits IL‐23‐mediated signaling. Guselkumab has been approved in several countries to treat patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and patients with active psoriatic arthritis, with an additional indication in Japan and Korea for the treatment of palmoplantar pustulosis [7, 8, 9, 10]. The efficacy and well‐tolerated safety profile of guselkumab in patients with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis have been demonstrated by evidence from phase III randomized controlled clinical trials [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]. Guselkumab has also shown superior efficacy over adalimumab and placebo; the response to guselkumab was durable and the safety profile remained well‐tolerated over long‐term treatment up to week 48 in pivotal studies in psoriasis [11, 12]. Additionally, guselkumab maintenance therapy was effective in patients who did not respond to adalimumab [11, 12]. Clinical response to guselkumab was sustained with open‐label extension maintenance therapy for up to 5 years; consistent results were observed in the Asian subpopulation [13, 16]. The efficacy of guselkumab in patients with an inadequate response to ustekinumab and versus secukinumab has also been demonstrated [14, 15].
      Studies supporting the regulatory approvals of guselkumab were conducted in controlled settings and in patient populations that were restricted according to study eligibility criteria, and therefore may not be representative of real‐world clinical practice [17]. Evidence on the effectiveness and safety of guselkumab in patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis treated in routine clinical practice would be informative for therapeutic decision making. This observational study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of guselkumab in Korean patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis in a real‐world clinical setting. This study was conducted to fulfill the requirement of a local pharmacovigilance plan after regulatory drug approval according to the risk management plan in South Korea.

      Methods
      
        2.1
        Study Design and Patients
        This prospective, non‐interventional, observational study was conducted at 44 clinical centers in South Korea. Patients who received guselkumab according to the product label in the course of routine clinical practice were eligible [18]. Guselkumab is indicated for adult patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy in Korea. Exclusion criteria were enrollment in an interventional clinical study, prior history of guselkumab treatment, and contraindication to guselkumab per the approved product label. Patient selection bias was mitigated by enrolling participants consecutively as they attended regular clinic visits.
        Guselkumab was administered by subcutaneous injection as per the approved product label. The recommended dose is 100 mg at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter [9]. Patients were followed for up to 56 weeks (see Figure S1 for the study design). The primary data source was the patients' medical records; all data were entered into case report forms. The frequency and timing of patient visits were in accordance with routine clinical practice.
        This study was conducted in accordance with the International Society for Pharmacoepidemiology Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practices. The protocol and any amendments, and the patient informed consent form, were approved by the local institutional review board/independent ethics committee at participating sites. All patients provided written informed consent before participation.
      
      
        2.2
        Outcomes
        Demographic and disease characteristics (disease history, medical history, previous therapies) were recorded at visit 1 (baseline, week 0). Data for the following parameters were collected at visits 1 (baseline, week 0), 2 (approximately week 4), and 3–7 (approximately every 8 weeks after week 4, weeks 12–44): Guselkumab administration status; concomitant medications; effectiveness parameters (Psoriasis Areas and Severity Index [PASI], BSA affected, and Investigator's Global Assessment [IGA]); patient‐completed patient‐reported outcome (PRO) instruments (administered as available at each clinical practice; Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] and Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire [MSQ]). Data for parameters, excluding guselkumab administration status, were also collected at treatment discontinuation. Safety was monitored from the first dose of guselkumab to 12 weeks after the last dose (i.e., week 56), or until loss to follow‐up, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurred first.
        Since this was a real‐world study, the frequency and timing of treatment administration and patient visits were in accordance with routine clinical practice, and as such, may not have occurred precisely every 4 or 8 weeks per label instructions. Treatment was generally administered within ±2 weeks of the label‐defined treatment intervals by healthcare professionals at hospitals; hence, the second injection was administered 4 ± 2 weeks (visit 2) after visit 1 and then 8 ± 2 weeks after each previous treatment (visits 3–7) over the duration of the present study [9, 10].
      
      
        2.3
        Statistical Analyses
        Sample size was determined assuming an incidence rate of serious infection/malignancy of 0.6% [11]. Serious infection and malignancy are the important potential safety risks for guselkumab identified based on results from all clinical trials. The sample size was set at 600 patients, targeting 20% more than the 500 patients calculated to detect at least two cases of serious infection/malignancy with 80% statistical power to account for patients who discontinued participation over the course of the study.
        Effectiveness was evaluated for all participants who received at least one dose of study drug and had both baseline and at least one post‐baseline effectiveness evaluation (effectiveness analysis set). Safety was evaluated for all participants who received at least one dose of study drug (safety analysis set).
        Effectiveness data were summarized at baseline and at each visit using descriptive statistics and compared using paired t‐test or Wilcoxon signed‐rank test for PASI, BSA, and DLQI. The proportions of participants with IGA 0/1 and MSQ levels of satisfaction or dissatisfaction (extremely, very, somewhat, and neither satisfied nor dissatisfied) at baseline and each visit were summarized and compared using McNemar's test. Drug survival (i.e., the rate and duration of adherence to the study drug) was assessed using Kaplan–Meier statistics. Factors predicting PASI75, PASI90, or PASI100 responses at week 44 (visit 7) were assessed by univariable analysis; those found to be predictive at p < 0.1 were further evaluated by multivariable logistic regression analysis, with age, sex, and PASI score at baseline as covariates. Safety data were summarized as numbers and percentages of adverse events (AEs) occurring during the study period; incidence rates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Analyses were two‐sided and p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using statistical software package SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

      Results
      
        3.1
        Patient Population
        Between February 25, 2019 and March 25, 2022, 717 Korean patients with plaque psoriasis were screened, and 707 patients who met eligibility criteria were enrolled (Figure S2). At the data cutoff date (August 23, 2022), 562 (79.5%) patients had completed the 56‐week study observation period. Of the 145 (20.5%) patients who discontinued early, loss to follow‐up (n = 53, 36.6%), discontinuation of guselkumab (n = 45, 31.0%), and patient withdrawal of consent (n = 2, 1.4%) were the main reasons for leaving the study. The safety analysis set comprised 707 patients. The effectiveness analysis set comprised 531 patients; 176 patients were excluded because they had PASI < 10 or BSA < 10% (n = 132) at baseline or did not have both baseline and post‐baseline effectiveness data (n = 44) (Figure S2).
        The overall population had a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 45.8 ± 13.9 years and was predominantly male (n = 477, 67.5%); mean ± SD disease duration was 119.9 ± 114.8 months (Table 1). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n = 82, 11.3%) and rheumatic autoimmune disease (n = 75, 10.6%), and two (0.3%) patients had co‐existing palmoplantar pustulosis. The majority of patients had PASI ≥ 10 (570/674, 84.6%) and BSA ≥ 10% (572/659, 86.8%) at baseline. Most had received prior systemic therapy (n = 631, 89.3%); other common prior treatments were phototherapy (n = 494, 69.9%) and topical therapy (n = 427, 60.4%). The most common systemic oral agents previously used were cyclosporin A (n = 414, 58.6%) and methotrexate (n = 330, 46.7%). Prior biologic therapy had been received by 236/707 (33.4%) patients, and 471 (66.6%) had never been treated with a biologic agent (Table 1).

        Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally comparable between the subgroups of patients with and without prior biologic therapy (Table 1), although some imbalances between the two groups were noted. Compared with the biologic‐naïve group, respectively, the biologic‐experienced group was older (mean ± SD 44.4 ± 13.5 vs. 48.4 ± 14.3 years; p = 0.0008) and had a longer disease duration (104.3 ± 105.0 vs. 151.1 ± 126.8 months; p < 0.0001), lower PASI score (15.8 ± 6.2 vs. 10.6 ± 5.6; p < 0.0001), and lower BSA (20.7% ± 12.9% vs. 12.2% ± 11.5%; p < 0.0001), and a greater proportion had received a systemic oral agent (n = 34 [7.2%] vs. n = 40 [16.9%]; p < 0.0001) or topical therapy (n = 195 [41.4%] vs. n = 142 [60.2%]; p < 0.0001). Most biologic‐experienced patients (n = 199, 84.3%) had received just one prior line of biologic therapy; seven (3.0%) had received ≥ 3 prior lines (Table 1).

PASI Responses
          The proportion of patients with an absolute PASI of ≤ 3, ≤ 2, or ≤ 1 increased over time, reaching a maximum of 96.0%, 86.7%, and 59.0%, respectively, at visit 7 in the overall population (Figure 1). A significantly greater proportion of biologic‐naïve (vs biologic‐experienced) patients achieved an absolute PASI of ≤ 3 by visits 5–7 (p = 0.001 at visit 7) and absolute PASI of ≤ 2 by visits 6–7 (p = 0.0014 at visit 7). The proportion of patients with a PASI75 response increased after the start of treatment, reaching 98.5% at visit 7. The proportions of patients with PASI90 and PASI100 responses also increased over time, reaching 74.3% and 25.4%, respectively, at visit 7 (Figure S3). Compared with the biologic‐experienced group, a significantly greater proportion of biologic‐naïve patients achieved PASI75 (biologic‐naïve vs. biologic‐experienced, 99.4% vs. 94.9%, p = 0.0141) and PASI90 (78.0% vs. 59.0%, p = 0.0006) responses at visit 7.

IGA Response
          IGA responses (IGA 0 [cleared], IGA 1 [minimal], or IGA 2 [mild]) also improved over time with guselkumab treatment. By visit 5, all patients in the overall population had achieved an IGA score of 2 or lower. The proportion of patients who achieved IGA 0/1 increased over time, in both the biologic‐naïve and biologic‐experienced patient groups (Figure 2). IGA 0/1 was achieved by 96.5% (221/229) of all patients at visit 7, and by 97.4% (184/189) and 92.5% (37/40) of biologic‐naïve and biologic‐experienced patients, respectively, with no significant difference between these two subgroups.

          DLQI
          DLQI score decreased over time in the overall population, reaching a mean score of 2.0 ± 3.1 (n = 234) at visit 7 (Table S1). The pattern of improvement over time was similar regardless of history of biologic therapy; the biologic‐naïve and biologic‐experienced groups achieved mean scores of 1.9 ± 3.1 (n = 188) and 2.4 ± 3.1 (n = 46), respectively, at visit 7. The proportion of patients achieving DLQI 0/1 increased after the start of treatment and was 64.1% (150/234 patients) at visit 7 for the overall population. Improvement in DLQI 0/1 response over time was seen in both biologic‐naïve and biologic‐experienced groups (Table S2). At visits 6 and 7, a greater proportion of biologic‐naïve patients achieved DLQI 0/1 compared with biologic‐experienced patients.

          Drug Survival
          Drug survival rates for guselkumab were high throughout the study observation period. The estimated drug survival rate at 1 year was 92.7% (Figure 3). The reasons for treatment discontinuation are presented in Table S3. The most common reasons for discontinuation were study completion and loss to follow‐up.

          Correlation Analysis
          In the univariable logistic regression analysis, factors that may predict PASI90 response at visit 7, based on a significance threshold of p < 0.10, were sex; chest or nail psoriasis morphology; baseline PASI score; baseline IGA score indicating moderate or severe disease; a baseline MSQ score of 2; prior treatment with phototherapy, topical therapy, and biologic therapy; and concomitant treatment with a systemic oral agent or topical therapy (Table 2). The only factors that were still predictive of PASI90 response at visit 7 in the multivariable logistic regression analysis, at a significance threshold of p < 0.05, were sex (female vs. male, odds ratio [OR], 2.36; p = 0.0499), nail morphology (yes vs. no, OR, 0.37; p = 0.0237), baseline total PASI score (OR, 1.18; p = 0.0087), baseline IGA score indicating moderate or severe disease (moderate vs. minimal, OR, 3.58; p = 0.0009; severe vs. minimal, OR, 0.26, p = 0.0098 respectively), and concomitant treatment with a topical therapy (yes vs. no, OR, 0.23; p = 0.0004) (Table 2).

        Safety
        Cumulative follow‐up over the course of the study was 581.8 patient years (PY), with a median follow‐up time of 0.9 years. There were 245 AEs reported in 159 (22.5%) patients, with an incidence rate (95% CI) of 42.1 (38.1–46.1) per 100 PY. The most frequent AEs were pruritus (23 patients, 4.0 [95% CI 2.4–5.5] per 100 PY), urticaria (10 patients, 1.7 [95% CI 0.7–2.8] per 100 PY), folliculitis (8 patients, 1.4 [95% CI 0.4–2.3] per 100 PY), and arthralgia (8 patients, 1.4 [95% CI 0.4–2.3] per 100 PY) (Table 3). Most AEs each occurred in just one patient. A total of 14 serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 13 (1.8%) patients, with an incidence rate (95% CI) of 2.4 (1.2–3.7) per 100 PY. A full list of SAEs is provided in Table S6. The most frequent type of SAE (by System Organ Class) was gastrointestinal disorders, which occurred in three (0.4%) patients. By preferred term, no SAE occurred in more than one patient. Regarding AEs of special interest: Malignancies with onset after study start were reported for two (0.3%) patients, one with breast cancer and another with prostate cancer; a single cardiovascular AE, palpitations, was reported in one (0.1%) patient. There was one case of serious infection, reported as enterocolitis infectious (Table S6).

      Discussion
      In this large, prospective, observational study conducted over a period of approximately 1 year, guselkumab demonstrated a high level of effectiveness and was well‐tolerated in Korean patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis treated in routine clinical practice. The findings from this study complement the evidence obtained from pivotal clinical trials for guselkumab in psoriasis. Guselkumab conferred durable responses, with 96.0%, 86.7%, and 59.0% of patients achieving absolute PASI scores of ≤ 3, ≤ 2, and ≤ 1, respectively, and 96.5% of patients having minimal or clear disease by visit 7. Absolute PASI is a frequently used endpoint for evaluating effectiveness of psoriasis treatments in clinical practice, and it has been suggested that absolute PASI ≤ 3 may be of particular clinical relevance [19]. Furthermore, guidelines for psoriasis treatment recommend targeting an absolute PASI goal as part of any treatment plan [20, 21, 22, 23, 24].
      This study also demonstrated high proportions of patients achieving PASI75 (98.5%), PASI90 (74.3%), and IGA 0/1 (96.5%) responses at visit 7 (approximately week 44). In general, results were consistent with those obtained from randomized controlled clinical trials of patients with moderate–to‐severe psoriasis. Although patients in the present study had a shorter disease duration and less severe disease based on baseline BSA, and PASI and IGA scores compared with those in clinical trials, a consistent treatment effect was seen. In the global phase III VOYAGE 1 study, 87.8% and 76.3% of patients achieved PASI75 and PASI90 responses, respectively, and 80.5% achieved IGA 0/1 at week 48 with guselkumab—each higher than the respective response rates achieved with adalimumab [11]. In ECLIPSE, 92%, 84%, and 85% of patients receiving guselkumab achieved PASI75, PASI90, and IGA 0/1 at week 48, respectively [15]. NAVIGATE provided additional evidence for patients with an inadequate response to ustekinumab, showing that a higher proportion achieved a PASI90 response at week 28 after switching to guselkumab than those continuing with ustekinumab [14].
      In this study, over half of the patients reported a DLQI 0/1 response at visit 4 (approximately week 20), with an increased response rate at visit 7 (approximately week 44), consistent with improvements in DLQI response reported in clinical trials [12, 14]. Achievement of low absolute PASI scores corresponded with improvements in PROs, including the DLQI, such that for most patients psoriasis had either no or relatively little effect on daily life after treatment with guselkumab. In this context, the results reported in this study indicate that treatment goals are being successfully attained with guselkumab treatment in routine real‐world practice in Korea.
      The impact of race/ethnicity on the effectiveness of guselkumab remains equivocal. One recent systematic review found that the efficacy of biologics for treating moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis varied according to race/ethnicity and the particular biologic. Regarding guselkumab, IGA 0/1 was achieved by a greater proportion of White patients, compared with Asian, Black, or Latino patients [25]. However, a subgroup analysis of the VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 studies concluded that responses to guselkumab were comparable between Asian and non‐Asian patients with psoriasis [26]. Furthermore, genetic and non‐genetic factors underlying the pathogenesis of the disease may differ between Asian and non‐Asian patients, which may contribute to reported differences in efficacy between races/ethnicities. Compared with patients with psoriasis from non‐Asian countries (Europe and the USA), Asian patients have a lower bodyweight and body mass index, and more severe psoriasis. In addition, there is a male predominance in Asian patients, whereas it is generally understood that the prevalence of psoriasis is equal among males and females elsewhere in the world [27, 28, 29, 30]. Comparison of the baseline characteristics in the present study versus those in some other real‐world studies from Europe [31, 32, 33] revealed that Korean patients had a shorter disease duration, lower BMI, different profile of comorbidities, and slightly different baseline disease severity. These characteristics were similar to those of another real‐world study of Korean patients [34]. Comparison of the findings of the present study with other real‐world studies of guselkumab may provide insights into racial differences in treatment response to guselkumab in the real‐world setting. In an observational, retrospective, single‐center cohort study in Korea that included biologic‐naïve patients, PASI90 and PASI100 responses at week 56 with guselkumab treatment were observed in 91.3% and 82.6% of patients, respectively [34]. An observational study in Spain that included predominantly biologic‐experienced patients reported PASI90 and PASI100 responses at week 24 in 59.4% and 49.0% of patients, respectively; the proportions of patients achieving an absolute PASI score of ≤ 4 and ≤ 2 at week 24 were 85.9% and 77.9%, respectively [31]. In the current study, it was observed that treatment response was sustained over a longer follow‐up period, indicating that the effectiveness of guselkumab remained consistent and durable over time. Similarly, a study in the Czech Republic including both biologic‐naïve and ‐experienced patients reported that 94.8% and 70.7% of patients had absolute PASI scores of ≤ 3 and ≤ 1, respectively, at 36 months [32]. In another study in Belgium, the proportions of PASI75, PASI90, and PASI100 responders at week 88 were 95.5%, 91%, and 73%, respectively [33]. Although between‐study comparisons should be made with caution, the previous and present studies indicate no apparent differences in clinical response to guselkumab in Asian and Western populations.
      Conversely, the PASI100 response rate at visit 7 (equivalent to approximately week 44) with guselkumab treatment in our study (25.4%) was lower than those from other clinical trials and real‐world studies. In VOYAGE 1, 47.4% of patients achieved a PASI100 response at week 48 [11], and in VOYAGE 2, a PASI100 response was observed in 44.2% of patients at week 24 [12]. The difference in PASI100 response rates could be attributed to variations in baseline PASI score, study design, patient population, prior treatment, and real‐world practices regarding the use of biologics among countries.
      Guselkumab was effective in both biologic‐naïve and biologic‐experienced patients, but trending toward better responses in patients without prior use of biologic therapy. There was a significant difference in the proportion of patients with an absolute PASI score of ≤ 3 between biologic‐naïve and biologic‐experienced patients at visit 7, which is notable as absolute PASI ≤ 3 may have particular clinical relevance [19]. Similarly, in a real‐world setting in Chinese patients, guselkumab also demonstrated effectiveness regardless of prior biologic use. However, no prior history of biologic use was significantly associated with achievement of PASI90, PASI100, and absolute PASI < 3 responses at week 20 [19]. Overall, response rates were high in the biologic‐naïve group, consistent with responses demonstrated in the pivotal clinical trials of guselkumab. Clinical responses in the present study were robust and generally consistent with the results from clinical trials for both biologic‐naïve and biologic‐experienced patients; in particular, the more substantial response in biologic‐naïve patients supports guselkumab as an effective first‐line biologic therapy for patients with psoriasis in the real‐world setting [11, 12, 14, 15, 26].
      Factors predictive of PASI90 response in this study were female sex, nail psoriasis, baseline PASI total score, baseline IGA score indicating moderate or severe disease, and concomitant treatment with a topical therapy. Evidence of improved treatment outcomes in females compared with males has been reported previously in a large patient sample (n = 5346) [35], although this remains controversial [36]. Factors that could underly a sex difference in response to systemic therapies include differences in disease status, hormonal status, immune response, comorbidities, and treatment adherence [37, 38]. Nail psoriasis is a difficult‐to‐treat condition that is associated with prolonged and severe psoriasis, severe pain, and decreased quality of life, and may be a risk factor for psoriatic arthritis [39]. It is unclear whether the frequent use of topical therapies to treat nail psoriasis [40] may explain the reduced response (i.e., likelihood of achieving a PASI90 response) to guselkumab. The present findings suggest that to a point, the higher the baseline disease severity, the greater the probability of achieving a PASI90 response (a trend that was also seen in patients with a moderate baseline IGA score). However, in patients with very severe disease, the probability of achieving a PASI90 response was reduced. This may be due to the higher probability of previous biologic use, disease duration, and presence of comorbidities. Similar findings have been reported in a pooled analysis of clinical trial findings for patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis treated with apremilast, whereby patients with moderate disease were more likely to achieve a PASI score of ≤ 2 and had higher rates of PASI response compared with their counterparts with more severe skin disease [41]. That said, guselkumab remains sufficiently effective even in patients with severe disease. Since it may be challenging to demonstrate sufficient efficacy (i.e., PASI90 response) with increasing disease severity, active treatment may be necessary in these patients. Baseline PASI and IGA scores in patients with moderate or severe psoriasis have been identified as predictors of response to guselkumab in a study of super‐responders, with odds ratios (95% CI) of 0.97 (0.955–0.993; p = 0.007) and 0.66 (0.433–0.997; p = 0.048), respectively [42]. The correlation between baseline disease severity and response to guselkumab remains uncertain. In the real‐world setting, concomitant use of topical therapies is not uncommon (e.g., 47.7% of patients in the present study) and is likely due to inadequate response to a systemic therapy [6, 43]. This may explain the potentially negative impact on the ability to achieve a PASI90 response with guselkumab. These patients may have more severe or resistant disease, and thus possibly a reduced likelihood of achieving a PASI90 response with guselkumab. Further study into factors predicting response is needed, toward establishing patient prognosis.
      The present study demonstrates positive findings with guselkumab over a relatively short, 1‐year follow‐up; longer‐term follow‐up is needed to provide robust data on the efficacy and safety of continued guselkumab treatment for this chronic disease. A long‐term analysis of the global VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 trials (n = 1829 patients with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis) demonstrated that the efficacy with guselkumab observed at week 48 of treatment was sustained through 5 years [16]. The proportion of patients achieving a PASI90 response in the two studies was 84.1% and 82.0%, respectively, and 82.4% and 85.0%, respectively, achieved IGA 0 or 1. Findings were similar for patients who crossed over from adalimumab to receive guselkumab. Health‐related quality of life benefits during the double‐blind periods of both studies were also maintained over the longer term. The rate of guselkumab retention was high, with > 80% of those who received at least one dose having continued treatment for 5 years [16]. Consistent with this is the finding in the present study of an estimated guselkumab survival of 92.7% at 1 year. A pooled safety analysis of VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 for an additional 5 years of follow‐up (up to week 264) revealed a consistently favorable safety profile with no new safety signals; rates of AEs were low, including for those of particular interest in psoriasis (serious infections, nonmelanoma skin cancer, other malignancies, major adverse cardiovascular events) [44]. These long‐term efficacy and safety findings were confirmed in a post hoc analysis of Asian patients in VOYAGE 1 and VOYAGE 2 [13]. Long‐term data reported in a real‐world clinical setting were consistent with the findings for these clinical trials. A retrospective assessment of guselkumab in patients in clinical practice (Italy) with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis demonstrated improvements in disease that were maintained up to week 144 [45].
      In the present study, the drug survival rate for guselkumab was found to be remarkably high, with a 92.7% survival rate observed at 1 year. In comparison, a real‐world observational study in the Netherlands found that the overall 1‐ and 2‐year drug survival rates for adults with plaque psoriasis treated with guselkumab were 85.5% and 77.8%, respectively. When discontinuation due to lack of effectiveness was considered, the drug survival rates for guselkumab were 92.8% at 1 year and 88.7% at 2 years; and when discontinuation due to AEs was considered, the drug survival rates for guselkumab were 94.3% at 1 year and 92.1% at 2 years [46]. The drug survival rates reported herein may represent an underestimation of the true rates as a result of adopting the conservative approach of classifying cases with unclear reasons for discontinuation as events.
      Treatment with guselkumab was well‐tolerated. The incidence rates of AEs and the most common AEs reported were in line with other real‐world guselkumab studies [19, 31, 32, 34] and pivotal trials [11, 12, 14, 15]. There were no major cardiovascular events, and the incidence of malignancies was within the range previously reported in other studies (0.2%–0.6%) [11, 12, 14, 15]. In contrast to the pivotal trials for guselkumab, no cases of non‐melanoma skin cancer were documented in this study. The safety findings of the present study are consistent with those of several pooled analyses of global trials and retrospective database studies, including with long‐term follow‐up, that have consistently demonstrated no significant safety concerns with guselkumab [13, 31, 32, 44, 45, 47, 48]. Some of these studies reported rates (per 100 PY) of 148–346 for AEs overall (vs. 42.1 in the present study), 0.7–1.6 for treatment discontinuation, and 3.1–5.3 for SAEs (vs. 2.4 in the present study). Rates of AEs with guselkumab were low and stable over time (up to 5 years of follow‐up), and similar to those reported for placebo. Taken together, these findings highlight the good tolerability of guselkumab in this patient population.
      Strengths of this study include a large sample size, a multicenter design that enhances generalizability, and a comprehensive analysis of disease status, including both patients who have and have not previously received biologic therapy. In addition, it is particularly noteworthy that this study focuses on real‐world data and extends over a relatively long‐term period of follow‐up through 1 year of treatment with guselkumab, especially when considering its relevance to Korean patients. However, several limitations should also be considered. The absence of a control group impacts interpretation of effectiveness outcomes, and missing data may affect the overall accuracy and completeness of the findings. In addition, the study did not analyze psoriasis responses based on anatomical regions affected or the types of prior biologics received, which might limit the understanding of treatment effectiveness in specific patient groups. Lastly, as may be the case in any real‐world study, under‐reporting of less common AEs may occur.

      Conclusions
      Guselkumab administered under approved label recommendations was effective and well‐tolerated in Korean patients with moderate‐to‐severe plaque psoriasis in a real‐world clinical setting, regardless of prior biologic therapy experience, with no new safety signals identified.

Title: Prevalence of Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Antalya, Türkiye

Abstract: AbstractIntroductionHidradenitis suppurativa (HS) prevalence studies show considerable regional discrepancies due to various methodological and/or ethnic factors. The prevalence of HS in Türkiye has yet to be examined. This study aimed to assess the HS prevalence with a validated screening questionnaire in Antalya-Türkiye as part of the major project to determine the global prevalence of HS.MethodsThis single-center, cross-sectional study in a tertiary health institution was conducted among healthy volunteer adults accompanying patients in the internal medicine outpatient clinics of Akdeniz University between July and November 2022.ResultsThe study included 1,012 participants, 544 females, and 468 males. Seven participants (4 females and 3 males, median age 44.0 [IQR 40.5–54.5] years old) had HS, and the prevalence was 0.69% (95% confidence interval [0.33%–1.4%]). The proportion of HS at an early stage was higher than the rate previously reported from the same center in a registry research (Hurley I, 28.57% vs 16%). The examination of 110 screen-negative participants did not reveal any HS. There was no difference between HS patients and non-HS participants regarding gender, age, BMI, and daily smoking rate.ConclusionHS prevalence in Antalya seems compatible with the global prevalence of the disease. This study did not confirm the male dominance observed in Türkiye in earlier studies. The HS patients diagnosed in the study represent a milder spectrum of the disease.

Body: Introduction
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, debilitating inflammatory disease characterized by painful deep-seated nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts. The disease develops after puberty in apocrine gland-rich areas, often in the axillary, inguinal, gluteal and anogenital regions [1, 2]. The disease is most commonly seen between the ages of 20–29. While HS is mostly associated with the female gender in Europe (male/female: 0.3), it shows male dominance in Asian countries such as Korea and Japan and in Türkiye [2, 3]. HS substantially reduces many health parameters, functionality, and quality of life [3]. Prevalence studies of HS demonstrate considerable regional variation. A careful review of previous studies reveals methodological (hospital records, insurance database data, examination of special groups, self-reported HS questionnaire studies in larger groups, etc.) and diagnostic criteria differences. Accordingly, the prevalence of HS shows quite different results in the literature, ranging from 0.0003% to 4.1% [4]. The frequency of HS has not been studied previously in Antalya, Türkiye. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of HS with a validated screening questionnaire in Antalya, Türkiye, as a part of a major project to determine the global prevalence of HS.
    
    
      Methods
      This study was a part of the Global Hidradenitis Suppurativa Atlas (GHiSA) initiative and therefore followed the objective and approach previously published by Bouazzi et al. [5]. This was done to ensure uniformity across the involved sites. The study was approved by Akdeniz University’s Local Ethics Committee (70904504/360).
      This single-center cross-sectional study in tertiary care was conducted among healthy volunteer adults accompanying patients, who attended the internal medicine outpatient clinics of Akdeniz University, Antalya-Türkiye between July and November 2022. Written consent was obtained prior to the study participation. The questionnaire was translated into Turkish accordingly, and the content was checked by the first author. The data collection was carried out by intern doctors (S.A. and S.N.). After obtaining verbal and written consent, an intern doctor read the translated version of the questionnaire to participants.
      We excluded the department of dermatology as a site of inclusion due to a high risk of bias. Individuals younger than 18, pregnant women and patients who could not consent to participate in the survey were excluded from the study.
      The diagnosis was confirmed by an experienced dermatologist (E.A.) in patients who were positive for the validated screening questionnaire [6]. In addition to all screen-positive patients, 10% of randomly selected screen-negative participants were physically examined.
    
    
      Results
      Approximately 7,500 healthy accompanying adults at the data collection site were eligible for inclusion. A total of 1,161 healthy accompanying adults were approached, yet 149 declined to consent. The reason for not wishing to participate was photographing on 70 patients and time constraints on 2 patients. Other patients reported different reasons than the previous ones or did not give any reason. The prevalence of HS in the remaining 1,012 participants was 0.69% (95% confidence interval [0.33%–1.4%]). A total of 7 participants (four female, three male, median age 44.0 [IQR 40.5–54.5] years old) had HS. There was no difference between HS patients and non-HS participants regarding gender, age, and BMI. The patient group had a higher daily smoking rate than the non-HS participants (57.9%–31.4%) but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.32) (Table 1). Patients newly diagnosed as a result of screening represented a milder spectrum of severity compared with patients followed up in our clinic. Only 1 patient (14.3) was scored as Hurley 3, while the remaining patients were classified as either Hurley 1 (28.5%) or Hurley 2 (57.1%).

      Discussion
      This study found a clinically verified HS prevalence rate of 0.69% in the adult population of Antalya, Türkiye. The male dominance reported in earlier studies originating in Türkiye was not present in this study. Furthermore, the disease was milder in nature.
      Our study exhibited an HS prevalence rate of 0.69%, which is comparable to the prevalence rates reported thus far. To our knowledge, four studies appear in the literature investigating the prevalence of HS using methods similar to ours [7–10]. In the first study by Hagan et al., the prevalence of HS was reported to be 0.8% in 502 participants in Ghana [7]. This group’s second study, with a large number of participants (n: 1,486), identified the HS prevalence as 0.67 [8]. Han et al. [9], from Singapore, reported the HS prevalence as 0.585% in 1,025 participants. The HS prevalence was reported as 3.2% in the study by Botvid et al. [10] in Greenland on 506 participants. Taken together, environmental and/or ethnic differences may have had an impact on these results.
      Studies from Türkiye have revealed a strong male predominance, similar to that in Asian countries. Two multicenter studies, with 1,221 and 731 patients, showed that the female-male ratio was 0.62 and 0.69, respectively [2, 11]. A recent study of 100 patients followed in our HS outpatient clinic showed a rate of 0.38 [12]. This study demonstrated a female-male ratio of 1.3 for the disease. Although the number of HS patients is small, the male dominance observed in previous studies could not be detected. Prior studies conducted in Türkiye have largely been based on data collected from tertiary healthcare facilities. Males are more likely to experience a severe form of HS, and those with severe cases are more likely to seek out tertiary healthcare institutions for treatment, possibly contributing to the observed difference. By comparison, the female-male ratio in western countries is roughly 3, a higher ratio than that reported in this study. In contrast to previous reports of male dominance in Türkiye, our study found a higher frequency of HS in the female gender. Female individuals frequently accompany patients as companions. Consequently, we observed a greater number of females participating in our study (544 vs. 468). This may have influenced the ratio of female to male HS patients in the study.
      In our previous study, Mammadli et al. [12] summarized the data of 100 HS patients in Antalya and its neighborhoods. In the study [12], HS Hurley stages I, II, and III were observed in 16%, 71% and 13%, respectively, whereas in the present study these rates were 28.5%, 57.1%, and 14.3%, respectively. Compared to the study of Mammadli et al. [12], the present HS prevalence study revealed an increased rate of early-stage HS (Hurley I, 28.57% vs 16%), which supports our conclusion. Patients who are diagnosed based on the questionnaire tend to have a less severe clinical presentation when compared to those who are regularly monitored at our clinic. The findings of this study indicate that there is a necessity to raise awareness about the disease within the community.
      Analysis of gender, age, and BMI showed no difference between HS patients and non-HS participants. Although the proportion of smokers in the patient group was higher than in the non-HS participants, the result was not statistically significant, which may be due to the small sample size of 7 patients.
      Even though the screening questionnaire correctly identified all HS patients, there were still many false-positive participants. Upon clinical examination, many individuals who were misclassified as positive were diagnosed with other skin conditions like folliculitis, pseudofolliculitis, or acne. Our results indicate that relying exclusively on self-reported HS questionnaires may be inadequate and must be complemented with clinical examination for an accurate diagnosis. The positive predictive value was expectedly low (0.2) as the prevalence of HS in our study was low. These outcomes, generally, aligned with the studies utilizing a similar approach [7–10].
      In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the occurrence of HS in Antalya is similar to the worldwide prevalence of HS. The male dominance documented in past studies from Türkiye was not replicated in this study. The HS patients diagnosed in the study represent a milder spectrum of the disease compared to previous findings in Türkiye.
    
    
      Key Message
      The hidradenitis suppurativa prevalence of 0.69% in Antalya, Türkiye, seems compatible with the global prevalence of the disease.

Title: Prevalence of Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Dhaka, Bangladesh: A Hospital-Based Study

Abstract: AbstractBackgroundThe prevalence of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) varies widely in different epidemiologic studies from different parts of the world and very few data are available from South Asia.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of HS in Dhaka, Bangladesh.MethodsAn exploratory, cross-sectional, and descriptive study was done among 2,500 consecutive healthy accompanying adults of patients attending at the outpatient department (except dermatology), at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. This was an initiative of Global Hidradenitis Suppurativa Atlas (GHiSA), and it therefore followed the approach previously published by Bouazzi et al.ResultsOut of a total of 2,377 accompanying persons, 3 were diagnosed with HS. The point prevalence was 0.13% (CI: 0.04%–0.37%), sensitivity was 0.1 (3/3), specificity was 0.1 (23/23), positive predictive value positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.1 (3/3), and the negative predictive value was 0.1 (23/23). The median age of the HS patients was 45.0, and the median BMI was 28.0. All 3 confirmed HS were male.ConclusionsThe prevalence of HS in Bangladesh is lower than in western countries and other GHiSA studies like Singapore, Ghana, and Greenland.

Body: Introduction
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic and painful inflammatory skin disease. It significantly impairs the quality of both sexual and personal life [1–3]. It is believed to be of multifactorial origin with varies exogenous and endogenous factors playing a role [4, 5]. Endogenous factors include genetics and [1–31] hormones, while exogenous factors include smoking, obesity, bacterial infections, friction, and socioeconomic factors [6]. HS patients suffer from painful deep-seated, inflamed papules, nodules, cysts, abscesses, and sinus tracts with purulent discharge, often progressing to scarring [7, 8]. Despite its clear clinical criteria, HS is often misdiagnosed as abscesses, carbuncles or furuncles, and an average global diagnostic delay of 7.2–10.0 years has been showed [9–12]. Worldwide the prevalence of HS is widely variable ranging from 0.001% to 4.1 [13, 14]. The wide range of prevalence may be due to genetic, geographical, sociocultural, socioeconomic factors, or methodological differences across studies. Epidemiological data on HS from the Indian subcontinent are very limited and no data are available from Bangladesh [15]. Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated small countries with a population of approximately 170 million [16]. It is remarked for its ethnic homogeneity, where over ninety-eight percent are Bangla-speaking Bengalis [17]. Knowledge regarding the prevalence of this noncommunicable disease is essential for the development of a national plan for its prevention, management and treatment. This study aimed at uncovering the prevalence of HS in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
    
    
      Objective and Methods
      This study was a part of the Global Hidradenitis Suppurativa Atlas (GHiSA) initiative and therefore followed the objective and approach previously published by Bouazzi et al. [18]. This was done to ensure uniformity across the involved sites. This was a mono-center study carried out at the Outpatient Department (OPD) of pediatrics, obstetrics, internal medicine, and other departments (excluding dermatology), of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Participants were enrolled from 15th April to 15th December 2022 consecutively, but due to the variable processing time, an element of convenience sampling was present. Informed consent was obtained prior to study participation. The English version of questionnaire was translated into Bangla by two volunteers who are fluent in both English and Bangla and data were collected by trained research assistants. The trained research assistants approached the potential respondents and explained the purpose of the study, while also stressing the anonymity of data.
      Patients from all over the country take service from BSMMU, which is the highest referral hospital, situated in the capital Dhaka. The city is situated in the central part of the country and its population is more than 23 million [19]. Healthy persons accompanying patients to the BSMMU OPD were therefore considered as a representative population of the whole country. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (BSMMU/2022/4085; Date April 23, 2022) prior to study initiation. This study followed the STARD flow diagram for diagnostic accuracy (Fig. 1) [20].

      Results
      From the OPD, a total of 2,500 apparently healthy accompanying adults were approached for study participation, and none refused participation. Data were collected from 2,500 respondents but among these, 123 were incomplete and therefore excluded. Finally, a total of 2,377 participants were included for statistical analysis. Three HS patients were confirmed by dermatologists. A total of 23 screen-negative persons were randomly selected for clinical examination to verify the outcome. None of them had HS.
      The point prevalence in the final sample was 0.13% (CI: 0.04%–0.37%). There was a significant difference in the gender distribution in the sample. All (100.0%) the HS patients were male. The median age of the HS patients was 45 years. The median BMI for the HS patients was 28 kg/m2. The diagnostic accuracy of the screening questionnaire is presented in Table 1. The sensitivity was 0.1 (3/3), specificity was 0.1 (23/23), positive predictive value was 0.1 (3/3), and negative predictive value was 0.1 (23/23).

      Discussion
      The Global Hidradenitis Suppurativa Atlas (GHiSA) has taken an initiative to estimate the global prevalence of HS. In the current study, about two-thirds of the respondents were female as most of them were recruited from pediatric and gynecology-obstetric OPD. Moreover, socially, and culturally, patients are usually accompanied by female family members. The male family members commonly play the main earning role in a family in Bangladesh, and they are therefore more engaged in the work place [21]. Currently, studies show a gap in the gender distribution of HS in different regions of the world. In the European and North American studies, females are predominantly affected whereas in the Asian and Asia-Pacific studies male are predominant [22, 23]. In the current study, all three identified cases were male: however, inference regarding gender disparity cannot be drawn from this sample.
      Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for HS. Studies show that HS patients are 17.3 times more likely to be obese than healthy controls [24]. Considering the structural variations of Asians compared to the Western population, WHO has set the lower cut-off values of BMI to define overweight and obesity: ≥23 kg/m2 and ≥25 kg/m2, respectively [25]. In the current study, the median BMI of the controls and HS patients were 23.8 and 28.0. However, no significant difference was observed. HS usually starts after puberty, commonly at the start of the third decade of life. It tends to stay active throughout the third and fourth decades of life [26]. The mean age of onset of HS was reported between 20 and 24 years [27]. In a sex- and age-adjusted population analysis in the USA, Garg et al. found that approximately 50% of patients with HS are over 40 years old [28]. In the current study, the median age of the healthy controls was 32 years, and 45 years for HS patients.
      Most of the epidemiological studies on HS originate from Western countries, and there are very few studies available about the prevalence of HS in the Asian population. A population-based study from Korea shows much lower rates of HS (point prevalence 0.06%) compared to Caucasians and African Americans [29]. In the current study, 3 patients of HS were identified from 2,377 apparently healthy adults accompanying patients in the BSMMU hospital, resulting in a point prevalence of 0.13%. This is significantly lower than other GHiSA studies with same approach from Greenland (3.2%), Ghana (0.8%), and Singapore (0.6%) [29–31].
      This study was a part of the GHiSA initiative aiming at investigating the global burden of HS, and it was therefore conducted in a limited sample. The low prevalence indicates that a larger national sample is warranted.
    
    
      Key Message
      Prevalence of HS is lower than other countries of GHiSA studies using same study approach.

Title: Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) menopause: Literature review, knowledge gaps and research agenda

Abstract: There is growing interest in menopause discrimination in healthcare, the workplace and beyond. However, there is a dearth of research on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) experiences of the menopause. This article reports on a scoping review of the recent literature which identified a very limited number of articles and a wide range of knowledge gaps. This is discussed in relation to LGBTQ+ wider health, healthcare and workplace inequalities, and heteronormative and cisnormative conceptualisations of the menopause. A research agenda is proposed. Research should: be intersectional; differentiate between LGBTQ+ sub-groups; aim to understand how menopause experiences impact and are impacted by minority sexuality/gender identities; and examine how menopause healthcare and workplace support can be LGBTQ+ inclusive. Such research is urgently needed to ensure that LGBTQ+ people are fully included in menopause justice discussions and solutions.

Body: Introduction
      There is growing interest in the menopause, which is when a biological female’s periods cease and she is no longer able to reproduce. The bulk of the literature so far comes from the UK and the US (Cahn, 2021; Crawford et al., 2021; Westwood, 2024). It mostly affects cisgender (cis) women (i.e. those born as biologically female, designated as female on their birth certificate, and who continue to identify as female) in their late 40s to early 50s. The menopause is often preceded by symptoms for several years (‘perimenopause’) and may be followed by symptoms afterwards (‘post-menopause’). Symptoms vary, including hot flushes; night sweats; anxiety; depression; difficulties with memory and concentration (‘brain fog’); irregular periods; excessive bleeding; vaginal dryness; and reduced/loss of libido (National Health Service (NHS), 2023). Research on the menopause is growing and so too is the array of supports available. For example, in the workplace there is a growing number of menopause policies, opportunities for reasonable adjustments (e.g. flexible working, environmental temperature control, different uniforms, counselling/ mental health support, etc.), although this remains highly variable among employers (Beck and Brewis, 2024). In the community, there is a range of supports available, via the NHS, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), individual/group support, written information and guidance, and alternative therapies. However, GP knowledge and understanding is patchy (Dintakurti et al., 2022), and there is often limited availability of a full spectrum of services.
      Cis women affected by the menopause include those of all sexualities, that is, they may identify as heterosexual, bisexual, pansexual, lesbian, gay, queer, etc. It is not only cis women who are affected by the menopause and menopause-related symptoms. Some transgender women (‘trans women’), who were born biologically male, but identify as female, might experience menopausal symptoms if they undergo oestrogen reductions for clinical reasons in later life (Eismann et al., 2019) although whether they understand this in terms of menopause is contested. Additionally, ‘[s]ome trans men, gender nonbinary, and genderqueer individuals with at least one ovary and a uterus’ may also experience the menopause/menopause-type symptoms’ (Crawford et al., 2021: 1583).
      According to a recent 27-country study by Ipsos, on average, 80% of people identify as heterosexual, ‘3% as gay, lesbian or homosexual, 4% as bisexual, 1% as pansexual or omnisexual, 1% as asexual, 1% as “other”, and 11% don’t know or won’t say’. Ipsos also found that ‘[o]n average, 1% of adults describe themselves identify as “transgender”, “non-binary/non-conforming/gender-fluid” or “in another way” rather than as “male” or “female”’ (Ipsos, 2023). Overall, non-heterosexual people form a sizeable sub-population. They, and trans people, are entitled to equitable health and healthcare support including in relation to the menopause not only based on scale, but also on the principles of equality, diversity and inclusion (Fish et al., 2021).
      However, most of the current literature on the menopause relates only to white heterosexual cisgender women. As the UK Parliament’s Women and Equalities Committee (Women and Equalities Committee (WEC), 2022a) has observed,
Evidence to the inquiry and responses to our survey suggested that people with certain protected characteristics may experience specific challenges with menopause; witnesses pointed to LGBT+ people, younger women and ethnic minority women, in particular. Many people in these groups felt they were not included in a conversation which, when it happened at all, historically focussed on heterosexual, white, middle-class, ‘older’ women (para 11).
      There is highly variable menopause healthcare in the UK, with the prescribing of HRT amounting to a ‘postcode lottery’ (Iacobucci, 2022). Women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds are far less likely to be prescribed HRT than women from higher ones. Research has also suggested that women from lower socioeconomic positions, and homeless women in particular, experience more severe menopause symptoms (De Mello et al., 2021). In terms of women in prison, their needs are less-well met than women not in prison, especially among older women, whose menopause-related issues often go unaddressed (Van Hout et al., 2022). Women from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds are disadvantaged in multiple ways at the intersection of the menopause with race and ethnicity (Cortés and Marginean, 2022; Prasad, 2023). For example, ‘menopause is still a social stigma and a taboo subject in many minority communities, many communities do not talk about it openly yet . . . [and] there may be a general expectation for women to stay silent and not complain about their ailments’ (Prasad, 2023: 236). Women of migrant/refugee status are more likely to experience precarity in access to menopause care particularly those who are on the legal borderlands (Ussher et al., 2019). Women with intellectual disabilities face heightened challenges communicating about their menopause symptoms and being provided with accessible information in relation to them (Moore et al., 2023; Moseley et al., 2020; Schupf et al., 1997). Women with autism encounter limited awareness about their needs (Groenman et al., 2022; Karavidas and de Visser, 2022; Moseley et al., 2020): there is ‘a lack of professional knowledge, understanding and communication about menopause for autistic people, and an absence of support’ (Moseley et al., 2020: 1243). Women with complex/chronic physical health problems can find it difficult to disentangle their pre-existing symptoms with their menopausal ones which can also interact to mutually inform one another (MacGregor, 2018; Mollard et al., 2018; Morales-Rodriguez et al., 2023).
      However, while there is a growing awareness about how minority issues impact menopause experiences (Riach and Jack, 2021; Riach and Rees, 2022), (LGBTQ+) issues are rarely mentioned (Everett et al., 2021; Glyde, 2022a, 2022b, 2023; Throsby and Roberts, 2024). This is within the wider context of systemic LGBTQ+ health and healthcare inequalities, with LGBTQ+ people experiencing poorer health, and poorer health outcomes, than non-LGBTQ+ people (Fish et al., 2021; McDermott et al., 2021; Medina-Martínez et al., 2021; Zeeman et al., 2019; Westwood et al., 2020). Similarly, good practice guidance tends to exclude LGBTQ+ issues. For example, the European Menopause and Andropause Society (EMAS) position statement on the ‘essential menopause curriculum for healthcare professionals’, written by leading international authors (Rees et al., 2022), makes no mention of lesbian, gay and bisexual cis women’s healthcare needs in relation to the menopause and only mentions in passing that,
Some people require additional attention, with involvement of specialist services. These include women with chronic disease, premature ovarian insufficiency or early menopause or pre-existing disability, as well as transgender and gender-nonconforming people (p. 75).
      Turning to the workplace, in recent years, a growing body of research has highlighted that workplace systems are often not menopause-friendly, menopausal women are often under-supported, and many are subject to bullying and harassment, often linked to the intersection of ageism and sexism (Beck and Brewis, 2024; Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), 2023; Jack et al., 2021). Some women have sought legal redress in the UK and the US, primarily drawing upon non-discrimination legislation, although there are concerns about the extent to which the law currently provides sufficient protection from menopause discrimination both within and beyond the workplace (Cahn, 2021; Cahn et al., 2024; Crawford et al., 2021). In the UK there has also been a burgeoning of employment guidance and policies aimed at improving menopause support (Hardy et al., 2018). Several contributors to the Women and Equality Committee’s consultation process highlighted the importance of workplace menopause policies (where they exist) being LGBTQ+ inclusive (Glyde, 2022b; Trade Union Congress (TUC), 2022; UNISON, 2022). However again, despite an emerging appreciation that menopause is ‘an intersectional experience’ (Riach and Jack, 2021: 10793) most of the literature on menopause in the workplace relates only to heterosexual cisgender women. For example, in the UK, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) recently surveyed 2000 women about their experiences of menopause in the workplace (Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), 2023). The study did not ask about sexual orientation or gender identity.
      Despite the expanding appreciation of menopause and diversity, and a growing interest in achieving ‘menopause justice’ (Cahn, 2021) by eradicating menopause inequalities, research on LGBTQ+ people experiencing the menopause remains ‘desperately needed’ (Riach and Rees, 2022: 100395). This is clearly an equality issue, with implications for the care and support of LGBTQ+ people in healthcare services, the workplace and beyond. The discursive silencing of LGBTQ+ individuals’ experiences of the menopause, obscured and occluded by heteronormative and cisnormative framing of it, not only prevents an understanding of those experiences, but it also paints a partial (heteronormative, cisnormative) picture of menopause, thus limiting full appreciation of its multiple, complex, intersectional meanings.
      This article reports on a scoping literature review of recent articles based on empirical research about LGBTQ+ experiences of the menopause. It synthesises the available evidence reported in those articles, identifies knowledge gaps and sets a research agenda to improve much-needed knowledge and understanding.
    
    
      Method
      The research design was a scoping literature review (Arksey and O’Malley, 2005). The research questions were: (1) ‘How many empirical studies in the past ten years have been conducted specifically on lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, transgender and/or gender non-binary persons’ experiences of the menopause, with particular focus on healthcare and the workplace?’; (2) ‘What did those studies find?’; and (3) ‘Which area(s) is/are under-addressed in the literature?’
      The databases searched were Medline (Ovid), PsycInfo (Ovid), PubMed and Web of Science Core Collection. A general Google search (for grey literature) was also conducted. Literature was limited to English language publications, between January 2014 and December 2023. Additional references were searched by cross-checking references in selected literature. Search terms are listed in Figure 1. Exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 2. Other systematic reviews were examined (Sobel et al., 2024), and their reference lists hand-searched.

Explored ‘how married straight and lesbian women understand sexual changes in midlife’ (p. 7). Part of the results and analysis focused on the menopause. N = 48 women and 16 men, in their relationships for 7–32 years. Women’s average age = 50, men’s average age 53. All were cisgender. Among the 16 ‘straight women’, 13 identified as White, 1 as Asian, two as Black. Among the 16 men, 15 identified as White, and one as Black. Among the 32 lesbians, 29 identified as White, and 3 identified as Black. Gender identity: all were cisgender.

                Both lesbians and ‘straight’ women described diminished interest in sex associated with the menopause. Lesbians also described the combined effects on interest in sex of both partners going through the menopause and showed greater concern over weight gain (contradicting previous research). Unlike the ‘straight’ couples, the lesbian couples reported enhanced closeness and communication in response to shared age- and menopause- related experiences and reduced interest in sex.

Sleeping difficulties decreased temporarily. No changes were observed in palpitations, dizziness, abdominal complaints, anxiety, panic attacks, cognition, and pain, except for clitoral and breast pain’ (p. 1297). Trans men reported increases in night sweats, ‘weight gain, and clitoral pain. Persistent increases were reported for hot flashes, balding, voice instability, acne, and increase in sexual desire, whereas emotional instability, fear, and menses decreased’ (p. 1297) The results were not analysed in relation to ‘menopause’.

                One quote from a lesbian:• ‘I identify as lesbian. My partner started her menopause a few years before me. Far less embarrassment as a result. Much more understanding. Both having hot flushes together or feeling tired. Easy to have a conversation and not feel ashamed. Easier to work through things like reduced vaginal lubrication and sexual discomfort during intercourse (her experience for a short period) because as two women there is good understanding and communication. In a conversation with my ex-husband who was struggling with coping with his wife’s menopause and not really understanding what was happening for her, the contrast was very striking . . .’ (p. 14)Two quotes from non-binary individuals:• ‘I’m non-binary and we are largely erased from menopause discussions’.

                Qualitative study examining women’s sexual identity work during menopause. In-depth interviews with 11 menopausal women, aged between 46 and 61. N = 7 ‘sexually preferred’ (p. 5) men, n = 1 ‘sexually preferred both men and women’; n = 1 ‘sexually preferred’ women; n = 1 ‘sexually preferred’ men, but ‘indicated that she was open to all people’ (p. 6). The profile of one of the participants was not reported. Gender identity: not reported. Race/ethnicity: not reported.

                ‘. . . sexuality in menopause goes back to what it means to be a woman, even a human. In this life- and body-changing phase, women may feel particular urgency to relate and make sense of themselves and their bodies (again), something that may be done within and through sexuality’. (p. 15) Different sexualities (e.g. preferences for women/men/both/‘open to all’) not addressed in analysis nor discussion.

                Qualitative study on ‘being queer and menopausal’ (p. 516). 12 interviews (10 on Zoom; 2 in-person). Interviewees aged 46–62. 11 were ‘AFAB’ (assigned female at birth), and one ‘AMAB’ (assigned male at birth). 3 were cis, 3 non-binary, 2 transmasculine, 1 each agender, genderfluid, genderqueer, transfeminine. 6 were queer, 3 pansexual, 1 each asexual, bisexual, lesbian. Ethnicity not reported.
                UK-based study. Sample from UK (n = 9), US (n = 1); Australia (n = 1); Belgium (n = 1).
                Lack of knowledge information about ‘queer menopause’ (p. 514). Queer menopausal clients in (psycho-) therapy likely to have historical and contemporary negative healthcare and life experiences. Therapists should avoid making assumptions about queer menopausal clients, including about the menopause being a negative experience. Therapists need more training in this area.
                Analysis of findings focused on implications for (psycho-)therapists although this was not made explicit in the methodology.
              
            
          
        
      
      Four studies were conducted solely with sub-groups of LGBTQ+ people. Wingo et al.’s (2018) study on reproductive health care needs comprised ‘female-assigned-at-birth individuals (ages 18–44) who also identified as lesbian, bisexual, queer, and/or genderqueer, or transmasculine’ (p. 350). Van Dijk et al.’s (2019) study examining experiences during the first 12 months of gender-affirming hormone treatment (HT) comprised both transgender women and men. Glyde’s (2023) study of ‘being queer and menopausal’ (p. 516) comprised 12 interviewees, 11 of whom were ‘AFAB’ (assigned female at birth), and one ‘AMAB’ (assigned male at birth). Three were cisgender, three non-binary, two transmasculine, one each agender, genderfluid, genderqueer, transfeminine. Six were queer, three pansexual, one each asexual, bisexual, lesbian. Mohamed and Hunter’s (2019) study comprised solely transgender women, exploring their beliefs about menopause and hormone therapy (HT).
      Six were mixed studies. Paine et al.’s (2019) study of sexual changes in midlife comprised 16 ‘straight’ couples and 16 lesbian couples. Ussher et al.’s (2019) article on sex and the menopausal woman drew upon two studies, one of which comprised 17 heterosexual women and five lesbians. Kruk et al.’s (2021) study on feelings about menstruation cessation. comprised 97% heterosexual women and 3% ‘sexual minority women’. Sang et al.’s (2021) study of ‘the lived experiences of those who experience menstruation, menopause, and gynaecological health conditions while working in higher education’ (p. 1955) comprised 627 participants, 11 of whom (2%) identified as queer, agender, non-binary or as men. However, the findings were not analysed by sexual identity or gender identity. De Boer’s (2023) study examining women’s sexual identity work during menopause comprised 11 participants, seven of whom ‘sexually preferred’ men, one who ‘sexually preferred both men and women’; one who ‘sexually preferred’ women; and one ‘sexually preferred’ men, but ‘indicated that she was open to all people’ (p. 6). The profile of the eleventh participant was not reported and the findings were not reported/analysed according to sexual identity nor gender identity. The Women and Equalities Committee’s (WEC, 2022b) survey on the impact of the menopause in the workplace and beyond comprised 82% of participants whose gender identity was the same as their sex registered at birth while 0.2% reported their gender identity was not the same as their sex as registered at birth and 2%. 16% of respondents preferred not to say/did not respond. Sexual identity was not reported.
      Most of the studies reported on either participants’ sexual identity or their gender identity but not both. Wingo et al. (2018), Paine et al. (2019) and Glyde (2023) reported on both sexual identity and gender identity. Mohamed and Hunter (2019), van Dijk et al. (2019), Kruk et al. (2012), Sang et al. (2021) and the Women and Equalities Committee (WEC, 2022b) reported on gender identity but not sexual identity. De Boer (2023) reported on sexual identity but not gender identity. Ussher et al. (2015) reported on sexual identity but not gender identity in one of the two studies analysed and reported on neither sexual identity nor gender identity in the other study analysed.
      The identified studies offer very limited insights on LGBTQ+ experiences of the menopause. There was some suggestion that lesbian same-sex sexual activity, relationship- and communication styles might act as a buffer to issues associated with reduced sexual desire and/or vaginal lubrication (Paine et al., 2019; Ussher et al., 2015; Wingo et al., 2018; Women and Equalities Committee (WEC), 2022b). This echoes Winterich’s (2003) earlier study of heterosexual and lesbian women’s accounts about sex after menopause (which suggested that heterosexual women were ‘more constrained by cultural ideas about menopause, gender and heterosexuality’, less likely than lesbians to talk openly about sex and about their desires, and more likely to experience menopause-related sexual difficulties). It also resonates with Kelly’s (2005) study, which suggested that some lesbian identities might act as buffers to internalised gendered ageism. This needs to be better understood in relation to other research which suggests lesbians experience earlier onset and comparatively worse symptoms (Everett et al., 2021).
      It was also suggested that ‘sexual minority women’ might experience less of a sense of loss and fewer concerns about femininity than heterosexual women (Kruk et al., 2021). However this was undifferentiated by different minority sexualities and conflicts with earlier research which suggested that lesbians experienced greater grief/loss associated with the menopause than heterosexual women (Hyde et al., 2011).
      Non-binary individuals reported feeling excluded from menopause discussions (Glyde, 2023; Women and Equalities Committee (WEC), 2022b). Mohamed and Hunter (2019) reported that the transgender women in their study did not consider the menopause to be relevant to them. However, Glyde’s (2023: 524) study found that some trans and gender non-binary people do think it is relevant and are concerned about a lack of knowledge and information about ‘queer menopause’.
      Several studies were tokenistic in their inclusion of LGBTQ+ issues, either including LGBTQ+ people in their sample (often in small numbers) but then not analysing data by sexual identity/gender identity, or only mentioning them in passing. The UK Women and Equalities Committee (WEC, 2022b) report on its survey of over 2000 women in relation to their experiences of menopause in the workplace, claimed it included LGBTQ+ people. However it only provided data on transgender status, but not sexual identity. It included a single quote from a lesbian and two quotes from gender non-binary individuals, and its survey findings were not discussed in relation to either sexual or gender identity.
    
    
      Discussion
      
        Limitations
        The review was conducted by a single researcher and may have been informed by her particular standpoint (white, lesbian, older woman, intersectional feminist, social gerontologist, socio-legal scholar). The review did not examine the full spectrum of menopause studies (e.g. clinical, bio-medical) and it is possible that such studies may have included an LGBTQ+ sample. However, it is unlikely, as they tend not to profile sexual/gender identity in their demographics. Some studies with transgender women and men and gender non-binary people may not have been identified, if the language of ‘menopause’ was not used in those studies (Cheung et al., 2023; Mohamed and Hunter, 2019). The evidence solely comes from wealthy nations and may have limited implications globally, especially as so many LGBTQ+ people remain legally, politically and structurally oppressed around the world.
      
      
        Results implications
        The results support the concerns which have been raised about the paucity of research on LGBTQ+ experiences of the menopause. There are, first and foremost, strikingly few studies on LGBTQ+ experiences of the menopause. The narratives of cis bisexual women are particularly obscured in the selected studies, either not being mentioned at all or conflated, as is so often the case, with those of cis lesbians (as in, e.g. Kruk et al.’s (2021) study of ‘sexual minority’ women). The significance (or not) of menopause and menopause discourse for transgender people remains open to question, with competing narratives. For example while some research suggests trans women consider symptoms associated with reductions in gender-affirming hormones (generally for clinical reasons), to constitute the menopause (Glyde, 2023) other research indicates that for trans women ‘menopause was generally not considered to be particularly relevant’ (Mohamed and Hunter, 2019: 105). Similarly, for trans men, changes associated with gender-affirming hormone treatment may be more likely to be associated with adolescence/puberty rather than the menopause (Toze and Westwood, in press).
        The comparative lack of research about LGBTQ+ issues is located within current heteronormative, cisnormative and binary-based constructions of the menopause. While the literature on other aspects of intersections relating to the menopause is expanding, there remains a dearth of literature in relation to minority sexualities and minority gender identities. This is inequitable (Fish et al., 2021). There needs to be much more research conducted on how those with non-heterosexual and non-cisgender identities experience and navigate the menopause, so that their respective issues and concerns can be understood and addressed.
        The rhetorical silencing about LGBTQ+ issues also means that concepts and theories about the social contexts of the menopause are presently only partial ones. As Throsby and Roberts (2024) observe,
. . . the dominant historical framing of menopause has led to a research focus on cohorts of white heterosexual cisgendered women with teenage or adult children. . . If we want to understand the impacts of menopause both within and outside of the workplace. . . we need to widen the research frame and ask new questions about menopause as a mid-life, generative process. (23)
        Achieving a better understanding of LGBTQ+ menopause experiences will not only benefit LGBTQ+ people. It will also support wider and more nuanced understandings of the menopause, its contexts, and its meanings, and broader understandings of menopause-related issues. The ‘postcode lottery’ of access to HRT experienced by many cisgender menopausal women (Iacobucci, 2022), for example, has parallels with the ‘postcode lottery’ of access to gender-affirming hormone therapy among trans people (Cheung et al., 2023; Oktaba et al., 2023; Toze, 2020). Similarly, the positive impacts of menopause for both trans men and some cis women also offer the opportunity to understand menopause beyond narratives of decline to those of freedom and liberation (Throsby and Roberts, 2024). It is therefore essential to expand normative understandings of menopause (Crawford et al., 2021; Glyde, 2022a, 2022b, 2023; Jack et al., 2021; Throsby and Roberts, 2024).
        In terms of health and healthcare, LGBTQ+ healthcare disadvantages are now well-recognised. LGBTQ+ people experience worse physical and mental health, primarily caused by minority stress (Frost and Meyer, 2023), and greater healthcare dissatisfaction than heterosexual and/or cisgender people (Fish et al., 2021; McDermott et al., 2021; McNeill et al., 2023; Zeeman et al., 2019; Westwood et al., 2020). We know that reproductive healthcare is problematic for cis lesbians and bisexual women (Everett et al., 2021), where they face barriers associated with their respective sexual identities, and for transgender women and men and gender non-binary individuals (Norris and Borneskog, 2022; Rodriguez-Wallberg et al., 2023), where they face barriers associated with their respective gender identities. As Mohamed and Hunter (2019: 100) have observed, there are ‘gaps in knowledge about transgender health within the UK medical system, with few specialists in the area and reports of transgender people feeling dissatisfied’ particularly in relation to gender-affirming treatment and support.
        What we do not yet know, as this review has highlighted, is how these inequities apply in relation to menopause healthcare. This is especially important as recent studies have suggested that cis women with pre-existing physical and mental health problems are more likely to experience worse symptoms and greater distress than cis women who do not have these pre-existing conditions (MacGregor, 2018; Mollard et al., 2018; Perich and Ussher, 2022; Stute et al., 2020). Given that research already indicates that cis lesbians and bisexual woman, have comparatively worse physical and mental health than cis heterosexual women, and that transgender and gender non-binary individuals have comparatively worse physical and mental health than cisgender individuals, LGBTQ+ people could be more likely to be negatively affected by the menopause. There may be mitigating factors, such as the buffering impact of reciprocal support among lesbian couples suggested by the studies identified in this review, and also that for some trans people – trans men, for example – the menopause (which they may not even call the menopause) may be a time of liberation, self-determination and even a new adolescence associated with gender identity affirmative bio-medical and/or legal interventions (Glyde, 2023). We simply do not yet know or understand sufficiently well how the physical and/or mental wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people – across all the various sub-groups – is affected by the menopause.
        With increasing demands for LGBTQ+ health equity in many parts of the world, particularly where LGBTQ+ people are legally entitled to equality in healthcare delivery, LGBTQ+ people will be looking to see whether healthcare services are LGBTQ+-inclusive (Kenner et al., 2023; Rullo and Faubion, 2017), and this includes menopause healthcare provision. If those services are neither aware of, nor understand, LGBTQ+ needs issues and concerns in relation to the menopause it is unlikely they will deliver LGBTQ+-inclusive care and support. It is essential, therefore, that research is conducted which can inform healthcare providers in their provision of services to LGBTQ+ patients. It is also important providers understand these issues within regulatory frameworks, that is, healthcare laws, healthcare professional regulations, equality and human rights laws, and health and social care policies, in order to ensure compliance with them.
        With regards to employment, despite the increase in inclusive workplaces in some parts of the world, LGBTQ+ people continue to face discrimination, exclusion and barriers at work (Mara et al., 2021; Stonewall, 2018). It is important to understand this in relation to menopause in the workplace and in relation to menopause workplace support. Concerns about LGBTQ+-related discrimination on top of menopause discrimination may pose additional barriers for some LGBTQ+ people in seeking menopause support at work. As the International Menopause Work Consortium (2022) has observed, this also intersects across employment contexts: ‘[c]are should be taken when generalising LGBTQI+ experiences across different types of work such as professional and entry level work’ (para 34). It is again important to understand these issues within regulatory frameworks, that is, employment laws, health and safety laws, equality and human rights laws and social policies.
      
      
        Research agenda
        To address the knowledge gaps identified in this review, the following research agenda is proposed:
        
          
            Mainstream menopause research should routinely include representative samples of LGBTQ+ individuals, and include an analysis of sexual and gender identity in its findings.
          
          
            There should be dedicated LGBTQ+ research on the menopause, its experience, and healthcare and workplace support.
          
          
            Dedicated LGBTQ+ research should differentiate between the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and gender non-binary/genderfluid individuals and individuals of other sexual/gender identities.
          
          
            Key questions which need to be answered include:
a. Health, well-being and relationships
i. How and in what way is sexual identity relevant to the age of menopause onset, the type and severity of menopause-related symptoms, and the health, well-being and relationships of (a) lesbians, (b) bisexual individuals and (c) individual with other minority sexual identities?ii. How, in what way and with what contingencies is the concept/language of ‘menopause’ relevant to/for (a) trans women, (b) trans men, (c) gender non-binary/gender fluid individuals and (d) those with other minority gender identities?iii. Where applicable, how and in what way are minority gender identities relevant in relation to the age of menopause onset, the type and severity of menopause-related symptoms, and the health, well-being and relationships of (a) trans women, (b) trans men, (c) gender non-binary/gender fluid individuals and (vd) those with other minority gender identities?


b. Menopause healthcare
i. How and in what way is sexual identity relevant to the menopause healthcare experiences of (a) lesbians, (b) bisexual individuals and (c) individual with other minority sexual identities?ii. How does/would good menopause healthcare support look like for people with minority sexual identities?iii. Where applicable, how is gender identity relevant to the menopause healthcare experiences of (a) trans women, (b) trans men, (c) gender non-binary/gender fluid individuals and (d) those with other minority gender identities?iv. How does/would good menopause healthcare support look like for people with minority gender identities?v. What are the regulatory (e.g. non-discrimination, health equity, patient rights, etc.) implications of LGBTQ+ experiences of menopause healthcare support?


c. Menopause in the workplace
i. How and in what way is sexual identity relevant to menopause in the workplace with regards to (a) lesbians, (b) bisexual individuals and (c) individual with other minority sexual identities?ii. How does/would good workplace menopause support look like for people with minority sexual identities?iii. How and in what way is gender identity relevant to menopause in the workplace, with regards to (a) trans women, (b) trans men, (c) gender non-binary/gender fluid individuals and (d) those with other minority gender identities?iv. How does/would good workplace menopause support look like for people with minority gender identities?v. What are the regulatory (e.g. non-discrimination, employee rights, health and safety, etc.) implications of LGBTQ+ experiences of menopause in the workplace?


d. Comparing sexualities, gender identities and their intersections
i. How do the menopause experiences of cis lesbian, gay, bisexual and other sexuality minority women menopause compare with those of cis heterosexual women?ii. Where applicable, how do transgender, gender non-binary and other gender minority individuals’ menopause experiences compare with those of cis heterosexual women? How does this compare between (a) heterosexual and (b) sexual minority transgender, gender non-binary and other gender minority individuals?iii. Where applicable, how do transgender, gender non-binary and other gender minority individuals’ menopause experiences compare with those of cis lesbian, gay, bisexual and other sexuality minority women? How does this compare between (a) heterosexual and (b) sexual minority transgender, gender non-binary and other gender minority individuals?iv. What do these insights offer conceptual and theoretical framings of sexual and/or gender identity and the menopause?

          
        
        Research measures should not presume heterosexuality or cisgender identities. For example, the Female Sexual Functioning Index (FSFI) is often used to measure sexual functioning, including in relation to the menopause. The scale is presently framed in relation to heterosexual sexual function, referring to ‘penetration’ and male sexual partners. It should be adapted to reflect non-penetrative same sex-sexual activities and female sexual partners as well (Everett et al., 2021).
        All research on LGBTQ+ experiences of the menopause should be intersectional. There should be differentiation among the L, the G, the B, the T and the Q+ to avoid the conflation of diverse issues into one homogenised ‘LGBTQ+’ whole (Westwood, 2020). It is also important to recognise diversity within a sub-group. For example, there is great diversity among and between current cohorts of ageing lesbians and gay women particularly in terms of when and how they engaged with a lesbian/gay identity (Traies, 2016; Westwood, 2013, 2016). At the same time, it is also important to consider overlaps between sub-groups. For example, there is a significant overlap between bisexual and transgender identities (Jen and Jones, 2019). The different meanings and understandings of menopause among trans women, trans men, gender non-binary and other gender minority should be explored, including how this varies according to sexual identity (Vincent, 2020). Across all these issues other intersections – including race/ethnicity, disability and socioeconomic status – must be addressed.
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      This review has highlighted the paucity of research on LGBTQ+ experiences of the menopause and menopause support. As Cahn et al. (2024) have observed, advocacy for menopause equity requires considering justice for all people impacted by the menopause not only heterosexual cisgender women. It is essential that the wide range of knowledge gaps identified in this article are addressed to ensure that understanding and responding to menopause-related issues encompasses the needs and concerns of all who are affected. It is to be hoped that the research agenda proposed in this article will serve as a launch pad for more inclusive and diversity-responsive menopause research, healthcare and support in the future.

Title: Novel melasma therapy using combined low fluence and microsecond pulse Q switched 1064 nm neodymium doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser

Abstract: Low-fluence Q-switched (LFQS) 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser treatment has become a standard approach for managing melasma. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a dual-mode approach—LFQS combined with microsecond pulse width (MPW) mode—for treating melasma. In this prospective, single-center, evaluator-blinded, split-face clinical trial, 28 patients with melasma were enrolled. One half of each face was treated using LFQS alone, whereas the other half received LFQS + MPW. Follow-ups were conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Of the 28 patients, 21 completed all treatments and follow-ups (5–10 sessions in total). Compared with baseline, the average Melasma Area and Severity Index score significantly decreased at 1 and 3 months. However, no significant change was observed at 6 and 12 months. The melanin index (MI) decreased significantly on both sides at 1 and 6 months, with the treatment side maintaining a significantly lower MI at 12 months. Although MI increased at 6 and 12 months, the increase was significantly less on the treatment side compared with the control side. VISIA analysis showed a significant bilateral reduction in facial pigmentation index at 1, 6, and 12 months, although the difference between sides was not statistically significant. However, the treatment side showed a significantly greater reduction in red area index at 1 and 6 months. No treatment-related adverse events were reported. The combination of low-fluence and MPW modes of Q-switched 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser is a safe and effective treatment for melasma. This dual-mode approach may help reduce relapse rates within 3 months after treatment discontinuation.

Body: Introduction
      Melasma is an acquired pigmentary disorder with a prevalence ranging from 8.8 to 40% across different ethnic groups, with particularly high rates observed in Asian populations1. As a common dermatological condition, melasma not only affects physical appearance but also contributes to psychological distress and can negatively impact work and social interactions. Despite its prevalence, the precise pathogenesis of melasma remains incompletely understood. Current evidence suggests several contributing mechanisms, including the biological activation of melanocytes, accumulation of melanin and melanosomes in the epidermis and dermis, increased mast cell numbers, photo-induced elastic fiber damage, alterations in the basement membrane, and enhanced vascularization2–7. First-line treatments for melasma typically include topical agents such as hydroquinone, chemical peels, and oral medications like tranexamic acid. However, these therapies often exhibit variable efficacy among individuals and are associated with high relapse rates8.
      In recent years, various energy-based devices—including lasers, intense pulsed light, and radiofrequency devices—have been increasingly applied in the treatment of melasma, demonstrating both safety and efficacy. Among these, laser therapy, a relatively novel approach, operates on the principle of selective photothermolysis. It targets and fragments pigment particles within melanocytes with minimal damage to surrounding normal tissues, offering rapid therapeutic effects. The use of low-fluence Q-switched (LFQS) 1064-nm Nd: YAG (LFQSNY) laser has progressively become a standard treatment modality for melasma9. This approach, commonly referred to as “laser toning,” involves the use of large spot sizes, low fluences, and multiple passes, typically administered over 5–10 sessions at weekly to monthly intervals. The mechanism underlying this technique is known as “subcellular-selective photothermolysis”10,11. However, most existing studies on LFQS laser treatment involve short-term follow-up and lack robust control conditions. Moreover, given the multifactorial pathogenesis of melasma, targeting a single pathological mechanism is unlikely to yield long-term and stable therapeutic outcomes. A previous study demonstrated that combining multiple modes of 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser treatment resulted in higher melasma clearance rates and lower relapse rates after 1 year of follow-up12. LFQS mode has been extensively studied and supported by a substantial body of evidence13; however, the additional modes employed in combination therapy, although theoretically promising, remain under-investigated. The microsecond pulse width (MPW) 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser, for instance, has shown efficacy in the treatment of acne and facial rejuvenation, with notable improvements in inflammation control, erythema reduction, and skin texture. Histopathological examinations have revealed increased collagen deposition in the papillary dermis following MPW laser treatment, suggesting that this pulse width induces thermal injury to small blood vessels and promotes collagen remodeling by targeting hemoglobin14,15.
      Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether combining LFQS and MPW modes of a 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser enhances treatment efficacy, reduces melasma relapse rates, and maintains safety in a prospective clinical trial.
    
    
      Materials and methods
      
        Study design
        This prospective, single-center, evaluator-blinded clinical trial was conducted from June 2021 to October 2023 and included 28 Chinese patients diagnosed with melasma. Inclusion criteria were (1) patients aged 18–60 years, regardless of sex; (2) no history of prior melasma treatments such as oral tranexamic acid, topical hydroquinone, laser therapy, or mesotherapy; (3) willingness to participate in a split-face controlled trial and comply with follow-up visits; and (4) provision of written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were (1) pregnancy or lactation; (2) history of photosensitivity; (3) presence of active skin diseases in the treatment area; (4) wounds, infections, or ulcers at the treatment site; and (5) any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigators, could interfere with the study outcomes.
        This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ninth People’s Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. The clinical trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2100049271) on July 28, 2021. All patients were informed of the treatment plan and potential risks. And written informed consent for both study participation and publication of identifying information/images in an online open-access publication was obtained from each participant. We confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulationst.
      
      
        Intervention
        Patients were randomly assigned to left or right facial treatment groups using the sealed envelope randomization method. No topical anesthesia was applied before treatment. Laser procedures were performed using the Fotona QX MAX® device (Fotona, Slovenia), equipped with a Q-switched laser (wavelength: 1064/532 nm; pulse width: 5–20 ns; frequency: 0.5–10 Hz) and a MPW mode (wavelength: 1064 nm; pulse width: 250 µs; frequency: 0.5–2.2 Hz).
        The control side (half of the patient’s face) was treated using only the LFQS mode with a spot size of 6–8 mm and fluence of 1.4–3.0 J/cm2, adjusted based on the clinical endpoint of mild erythema in the lesion area. Approximately 1000–1200 shots were delivered. The treatment side (the other half of the face) received dual-mode therapy: the same LFQS parameters as the control side, combined with the MPW mode using a full-spot handpiece (6–8 mm, 2.2 Hz) and fluence of 10–15 J/cm2, also adjusted to achieve mild erythema as the treatment endpoint.
        All treatments were administered by a single, non-evaluating investigator. Throughout the 1-year follow-up period, no cold compresses were applied, and no additional treatments or specialized topical skincare products for melasma were used. Strict sun protection was required for 1 month following the final treatment session. Patients were also instructed to avoid the use of tranexamic acid (topical or oral) and to refrain from undergoing any other form of phototherapy during the entire study period. Treatments were performed at 1-month intervals. The total number of treatment sessions was determined based on either the patient’s subjective evaluation or the treating physician’s assessment. Treatment was discontinued and follow-up was initiated when the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) score reached ≤ 2 or the Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score was reduced by ≥ 50%.
      
      
        Photographic documentation
        Standardized clinical photographs were taken by the same photographer using a professional digital camera (Canon 60D DSLR body with EF 50 mm f/1.2 USM portrait lens, Canon, Japan). Consistent lighting conditions, camera settings, and patient positioning were maintained throughout. Photographs were captured from three angles: frontal, 45° left, and 45° right. Additionally, digital images were obtained using the VISIA-CR imaging system (Canfield Scientific, Parsippany, NJ, USA) for objective analysis. The pigment index and red area index were used to assess the percentage of facial features that were better than the normative data for the same age group; higher values indicated fewer pigmentation spots and reduced erythema.
        VISIA photographs were taken under standardized lighting conditions using cross-polarized, parallel-polarized, and ultraviolet light at three angles: right lateral (37°), left lateral (37°), and frontal. Both sets of photographs were captured before each treatment session and during follow-up visits at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment.
      
      
        Clinical efficacy and safety evaluation
        The primary outcome was the number of treatment sessions required to reach the predefined treatment endpoint. The treatment endpoint was defined as either a GAIS score of ≤ 2—where 1 = ≥ 75% improvement (very significant), 2 = 50–75% improvement (significant), 3 = 25–50% improvement (moderate), 4 = < 25% improvement (mild), and 5 = no improvement—or a ≥ 50% reduction in the MASI score. Secondary outcomes included the VISIA pigment index and melanin index (MI), assessed using the Skintel™ Melanin Reader™ (Palomar Cynosure, Burlington, MA, USA). Pain levels during treatment were evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain).
        Relapse was defined as an increase in the MASI score16. All adverse reactions occurring before and after each laser treatment were recorded, including potential side effects such as post-treatment erythema, edema, bleeding, itching, blistering, scabbing, hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, infection, and scarring. The severity of each adverse event was assessed using a 4-point scale: 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). The overall frequency and average severity score were then calculated for each type of side effect.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median, as appropriate, whereas categorical variables are expressed as frequencies or percentages. Paired t-tests were used for normally distributed continuous data, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied for non-parametric data to compare pre- and post-treatment values. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
      
    
    
      Results
      
        Patient demographics and clinical outcomes
        Of the 28 patients enrolled, 21 completed the full course of treatment and follow-up assessments, with some loss to follow-up attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the 21 patients, 3 were male (14.3%) and 18 were female (85.7%), with a mean age of 38.7 ± 5.2 years. Based on Fitzpatrick skin type classification, 8 patients (38.1%) had type III, whereas 13 (61.9%) had type IV or V. Each patient received between 5 and 10 treatment sessions. Figure 1 presents representative clinical cases. Table 1 summarizes GAIS scores, patient-reported improvements by treatment side, and relapse rates at all follow-up time points. Patient-reported efficacy declined over time: the proportion of patients with a GAIS score of ≥ 2 decreased from 81.0% at 1 month post-treatment to 52.4% at 12 months. Nevertheless, the treatment side consistently demonstrated superior outcomes. Even at 12 months post-treatment, 14.3% of patients continued to report better improvement on the treatment side than on the control side. Patient self-assessments indicated varying degrees of melasma relapse beginning 3 months after the final treatment. At this time point, the relapse rate was significantly lower on the treatment side than on the control side (4.8% vs. 23.8%, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.047). Although relapse rates increased at 6 and 12 months post-treatment, the differences between the two sides were no longer statistically significant. Figure 2 shows representative images of patients who experienced relapse.

The GAIS score was 1 (very much improved), indicating better efficacy on the right (combination) side. The MASI score decreased from 15.6 to 7.5. The melanin index decreased from 34 to 28 on the LFQS side and from 36 to 26 on the LFQS + MPW side.

At baseline, the MASI score was 12, and the MI score was 30 on both sides. After eight treatment sessions and at the 1-month follow-up, the GAIS score was 2 (much improved), with better outcomes observed on the LFQS + MPW side. At the 6-month follow-up, the GAIS score was 3, indicating moderate improvement, with evidence of relapse on the LFQS side (MASI: 7.2; MI: 24 on both sides). By 12 months post-treatment, the GAIS score remained at 3, with bilateral relapse observed, more pronounced on the LFQS side. At this time, the MASI score was 9.9, and the MI score was 26 on both sides.

      
      
        VISIA analysis
        Quantitative analysis of facial digital images was conducted using VISIA imaging (representative cases shown in Fig. 3) before treatment and at follow-up visits. A significant improvement in the bilateral facial pigmentation index was observed at 1, 6, and 12 months post-treatment compared with baseline (paired t-test, p < 0.001). However, the degree of improvement declined at 6 and 12 months relative to the 1-month follow-up, though this reduction was not statistically significant (paired t-test, p > 0.05). Additionally, no statistically significant difference was found between the treatment and control sides at any follow-up time point (paired t-test, p > 0.05).

The right side was treated with LFQS (8 mm, 1.5–1.6 J/cm2) + MPW mode (8 mm, 10 J/cm2), and the left side with LFQS alone (8 mm, 1.5–1.6 J/cm2). (A,B) vs. (G,H) show baseline and 1-month post-treatment images of bilateral melisma under 37° white light, with visible improvement on both sides. Figures (C,D) vs. (I,J) depict pigmented spots under 37° ultraviolet light. At baseline, the pigmentation score was 60% on both sides; at 1 month post-treatment, the score improved to 77% on the LFQS side and 80% on the LFQS + MPW side, indicating bilateral improvement. Figures (E) and (F) vs. (K) and (L) show the red area index before and after treatment. At baseline, both sides scored 40%; at 1 month post-treatment, the LFQS side remained unchanged at 40%, whereas the LFQS + MPW side increased to 57%, suggesting a marked reduction in vascularity on the treatment side.

        No significant change in the red area index was observed on the control side at any time point following treatment compared with baseline (p > 0.999). In contrast, the treatment side demonstrated a significant improvement in the red area index at both 1 and 6 months post-treatment (p < 0.001), with values also significantly better than those of the control side at the same time points (1 month: p < 0.0001; 6 months: p = 0.0014). However, by 12 months post-treatment, the red area index on the treatment side showed no statistically significant difference compared with either baseline (p = 0.1307) or the control side (p = 0.3675) (Fig. 4).

        MASI and MI
        The average MASI score showed a significant decrease at 1 and 3 months post-treatment compared with baseline (p = 0.043). However, no statistically significant difference was observed at 6 and 12 months relative to baseline (p > 0.05). When compared with the MASI score at 1 month post-treatment, scores at 3, 6, and 12 months exhibited an upward trend, although the increases were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). MI scores demonstrated a significant reduction at 1 and 6 months on both the treatment and control sides (p < 0.05), and the treatment side also maintained a significantly lower MI at 12 months (p < 0.05). Although an increasing trend in MI scores was observed at 6 and 12 months, these changes were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Notably, the degree of MI increase on the treatment side was significantly lower than that on the control side (p = 0.004) (Fig. 5).

        Safety evaluation
        The average VAS pain score was 3.2 on the treatment side and 3.0 on the control side, with no statistically significant difference between the two. No treatment-related adverse events were reported throughout the study, including edema, bleeding, blistering, scabbing, hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, infection, or scarring.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that dual-mode laser therapy—targeting both pigment and vascular components of melasma—is safe and more effective across multiple clinical parameters compared with single-mode treatment targeting only pigmentation. Moreover, the dual-mode approach was associated with a lower short-term relapse rate during the 1-year follow-up period. However, in the long term, the relapse rate did not differ significantly from that observed with the single LFQS mode.
      In this study, subjective evaluations based on GAIS scores indicated that all patients experienced varying degrees of improvement, whether treated with LFQS mode alone or in combination with MPW mode. Although oral tranexamic acid and topical hydroquinone are commonly recommended as first-line therapies for melasma, patient compliance is often poor. This is primarily due to contraindications such as a history of smoking, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, or hereditary thrombophilia as well as the extended duration of treatment typically required (> 6 months)10,17.
      Since 2000, LFQSNY laser therapy has gradually become the gold standard for treating melasma in Asian patients, providing a relatively safe depigmentation effect through repeated sessions18. Compared with normal skin, melasma lesions exhibit elevated activity of melanin and increased expression of melanogenesis-associated proteins, including melanocyte-stimulating hormone, tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related proteins (TRP-1 and TRP-2), nerve growth factor, and stem cell factor. LFQSNY laser exerts a subcellular-level selective photothermal effect, which has been shown to significantly reduce the number of melanosomes and suppress the expression of melanogenesis-related proteins, while leaving the number of melanocytes unchanged11. However, inappropriate treatment parameters or poorly designed treatment protocols can still result in adverse effects, such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation18,19.
      Few studies have explored the long-term efficacy of LFQSNY laser treatment, and unfortunately, the relapse rate following treatment discontinuation remains high—reportedly as much as 58.8% at approximately 1 year post-treatment20. This finding is consistent with our study results. In our trial, the dual-mode approach combining LFQS and MPW achieved a higher relapse-free rate and prolonged relapse-free duration compared with LFQS alone. However, due to the clinical observational nature of this study, we were unable to directly investigate the underlying mechanisms. Given that the pathogenesis of melasma involves multiple factors, such as abnormal melanocyte function, photoaging, and vascular abnormalities2–7, we hypothesize that the combination of two laser modes may yield synergistic effects. Specifically, the LFQS mode is believed to reduce melanocyte activity and target melanin aggregation in the epidermis and dermis through a mechanism known as “subcellular-selective photothermolysis,” which selectively disrupts melanin without damaging melanocytes. In contrast, the MPW mode may contribute to improved outcomes by addressing vascular inflammation and photoaging. It delivers stacked 250-µs pulses that can coagulate superficial blood vessels and provide dermal heating, promoting collagen remodeling and reducing solar elastosis14,15. The ability of the microsecond 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser to induce dermal thickening and improve skin texture may help mask underlying pigmentary lesions. Notably, our study also observed a significant reduction in the red area index on the treatment side, supporting the anti-vascular and anti-inflammatory effects of MPW. A previous study reported that a 300-µs 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser stimulated new collagen formation in the papillary dermis14, and a 2020 study demonstrated successful treatment of moderate to severe acne and scarring using a 650-µs 1064-nm laser combined with isotretinoin, further highlighting the vascular coagulation and anti-inflammatory potential of MPW lasers21. These findings suggest that non-ablative vascular targeting, skin texture improvement, and collagen regeneration may contribute to the therapeutic effect of MPW in melasma management. Based on this evidence, we propose a tailored approach for future treatment: if baseline clinical evaluation or imaging reveals pronounced erythema or elevated red index, the combined LFQS and microsecond 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser strategy should be considered the first-line option.
      Although this study is among the few randomized split-face trials with a follow-up period of up to 1 year, it has certain limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small compared with that in a previous study21, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some patients were unable to undergo objective assessments 3 months after the final treatment, further reducing the number of participants included in the final analysis. Another limitation is the absence of histopathologic classification of melasma. The condition was assessed solely through clinical observation, without distinguishing between different subtypes based on pigment depth or morphological patterns. Given that melasma exhibits heterogeneous features, such as variations in pigment distribution and lesion depth, this lack of histological differentiation may affect the interpretation of treatment responses. It also makes it difficult to assess the specific impact of LFQS and MPW modes on different melasma subtypes and their respective pathophysiologic mechanisms. These limitations highlight the need for future studies to incorporate histopathologic evaluation to better stratify patients, optimize treatment protocols, and more accurately predict clinical outcomes. Furthermore, long-term studies are warranted to evaluate relapse rates following repeated courses of treatment and to identify predictors of sustained remission.
      In conclusion, the combination of LFQS and MPW 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser treatment proved to be a safe, non-invasive approach with no downtime or adverse reactions. This dual-mode therapy appears to enhance treatment efficacy and reduce the short-term relapse rate of melasma. For patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo combination drug therapy, this laser-based strategy may serve as an effective and minimally invasive alternative.

Title: Self-determined strategies for physical activity motivation among women with polycystic ovary syndrome

Abstract: Background:According to clinical practice guidelines for polycystic ovary syndrome, first-line treatment includes performing 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on most days of the week plus at least 2 days of resistance training. However, <40% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome engage in regular physical activity, and about 60% are sedentary. Research evidence supports theory-informed physical activity interventions to improve motivation for physical activity. This study examined the fit of a behavioral change theory for women with polycystic ovary syndrome.Objectives:The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze physical activity barriers through the lens of self-determination theory and identify motivational strategies that may promote initiation and maintenance of physical activity among women with polycystic ovary syndrome.Design:The study involved a qualitative, descriptive design using theory-driven thematic analysis.Methods:After emailing a demographic questionnaire and Personal Health Questionnaire-8 to screen for depressive symptoms, participants (n = 7) met three times via Zoom during the summer of 2021. Meetings were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed.Results:Participants were aged 33.9 (±8.1) years, premenopausal, mostly White (71%), educated (100% with at least some college), employed full-time (86%), and married (86%) with a mean depressive symptoms score of 6.4 (±3.4) indicating mild depression. Strategies such as a buddy system, physician support, technology, and behavioral change techniques are necessary to meet the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness among women with polycystic ovary syndrome to help increase exercise motivation.Conclusion:Findings supported the use of self-determination theory by emphasizing that the social context of polycystic ovary syndrome can undermine physical activity behavior. Thus, physical activity interventions should consider the social context, peer support system, and mental health status of women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and include tailored programs and motivational strategies to help meet the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

Body: Introduction
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrinopathy among women,
1
 affects about 20 million women in the United States across all races and ethnicities.
2
 PCOS is a complex, heterogenous collection of symptoms involving hormonal dysregulation.
1
 Diagnosis of PCOS occurs when two of three of the following conditions are present: menstrual irregularities, clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and/or polycystic ovarian morphology.
3
 PCOS is associated with central adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and depressive symptoms, placing the women at risk for cardiometabolic diseases, reproductive cancers,
4
 and psychological morbidity.
5
 Women with PCOS are three to eight times more likely to have depressive symptoms
6
 and seven times more likely to attempt suicide
7
 than women without PCOS.
      Physical activity (PA) has been well-established as a therapy for managing PCOS symptoms and reducing the risk of comorbidities.
3
 PA is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles requiring energy expenditure.
8
 PA includes exercise, both aerobic and resistance, which is planned, structured bodily movement with a fitness goal.
8
 As such, the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice PCOS Guidelines recommend that women with PCOS follow the PA guideline of 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity to prevent or delay the onset of comorbidities, as well as improve cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass index, and quality-of-life.3,8 Resistance exercise is recommended on at least 2 days/week,
3
 as it has been shown to increase metabolic capacity via increased lean mass, reduce insulin resistance, and increase bone mineral density,9,10 while reducing depressive symptoms among those with and without clinical depression, and more in women with PCOS than in women without PCOS.3,9
–15 However, <40% of women with PCOS engage in regular PA, and about 60% are sedentary.16,17
      PCOS-specific PA barriers have been reported as stigma-related stress due to appearance (e.g. hirsutism, obesity), symptom burden (e.g. depressive symptoms, fatigue), and lack of understanding of the condition by society in general, time, and confidence.18,19 These barriers impede motivation to exercise, especially in group-based and public settings, necessitating a search for effective and meaningful strategies to improve motivation. Research evidence supports interventions underpinned by theory and inclusive of psychological support.
20
 Motivation determines the initiation and maintenance of PA, as motivation drives all aspects of intention, activation, and persistence of goal-directed behavior.
21
 Interventions informed by self-determination theory (SDT) have growing evidence of improving motivation by identifying supports that help meet psychological needs.
22
 When psychological needs are met, people attain more intrinsic motivation to exercise, which may lead to behavioral engagement.22
–25 Thus, the purposes of this qualitative descriptive study were to explore PA barriers through the lens of SDT and identify motivational strategies that may promote the initiation and maintenance of PA among women with PCOS.
    
    
      Theoretical framework
      The science of health behavior change has increasingly emphasized theory-based approaches to intervention, as theories help identify underlying mechanisms of action and proximal targets of intervention (i.e. mediators and moderators).21,22 SDT, as introduced by Ryan and Deci, is a metatheory for the study of human motivation, personality development, and well-being.
23
 The underlying assumption of SDT is that humans not only are naturally inspired and agentic, but also require social supports or strategies to develop and maintain natural potential and well-being. SDT intersects personality and social context to predict the likelihood of adopting and maintaining a behavior, such as PA, by predominantly focusing on a taxonomy of motivations and three innate psychological needs.
      SDT was chosen as the lens for structuring the study, given its focus on motivation within unique social contexts. SDT explains that social norms may suppress an individual’s innate psychological needs of autonomy (freedom to choose a behavior), competence (ability to perform and master a behavior), and relatedness (sense of belonginess).
23
 Unmet needs suppress natural self-governing and create a shift in motivation away from self-determined behavior to more externally motivated behavior. Furthermore, based on SDT, individuals with decreased motivation require multiple strategies to improve need satisfaction. Thus, the extent to which people meet these psychological needs dictates their position on the continuum of motivation. Researchers that have employed an SDT perspective found that self-determination and motivational orientation, along with self-efficacy, offered an appropriate framework to further understand PA behavior among those with chronic health conditions

      Materials and methods
      
        Design and ethics approval
        A qualitative descriptive study was conducted from May 2021 to December 2021. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and 45 CFR 46.104(d)(2) and 45 CFR 46.111(a)(7). The University of South Carolina (USC) Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study (Pro00105265, December 7, 2020). As approved by the USC IRB, verbal consent was obtained from participants prior to each virtual meeting. The interviewer was supported by NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award (1F31 NR019206-01A1).
      
      
        Study setting and sample
        A focus group was formed of women with PCOS (n = 7) to analyze exercise barriers through the lens of SDT and identify motivational strategies that may promote initiation and maintenance of PA among women with PCOS from the perspective of women with PCOS. Our recruitment goal was for 6–10 individuals to keep the group size manageable and its participants comfortable sharing their expertise while also achieving diversity of opinion. Participants were recruited using the snowball method and social media, which allowed for a wider geographic reach and more diversity among a small group of participants. The researchers had no previous relationships with the participants. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was conducted virtually and used secure email to distribute and collect surveys.
      
      
        Inclusion/exclusion criteria
        Eligibility criteria were premenopausal women with a confirmed diagnosis of PCOS by a healthcare provider, an age of 18–42 years, and internet access for virtual meetings. Potential participants were required to submit via secured email confirmation of a PCOS diagnosis by a healthcare provider to be considered for the study. The age range was chosen based on a systematic review and meta-analysis that defined the start of the menopausal transition for women with PCOS at or greater than the age 45 years.
27

      
      
        Measures
        
          Demographics
          The demographic questionnaire included age, race, geographic location, educational attainment, employment and insurance status, marital status, number of children, height, weight, and comorbidities (see Supplemental Appendix A).
        
        
          Depressive symptoms
          The Personal Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) is one of several tools used to assess depressive symptoms among women with PCOS in previous studies, and it has been recommended for symptom monitoring among patients with medical (versus psychiatric) diagnoses.
28
 As such, the PHQ-8 was used to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms experienced within the past 2 weeks. The PHQ-8 consists of eight items with a four-point rating ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). As a screening instrument, PHQ-8 scores suggest potential levels depression based on the number of depressive symptoms: 5–9 mild, 10–19 moderate, and ⩾20 major.
29
 Construct validity was reported at 0.75 and internal reliability was reported at 0.81.
29

        
      
      
        Virtual meetings
        The focus group met three times for ~1 h/meeting. The virtual meetings took place during the summer months spaced apart by ~3 weeks. The researcher (P.J.W.) introduced the purpose of the focus group. Meetings were structured by using an SDT-informed interview guide (see Supplemental Appendix B) created by the first author (P.J.W.), a doctoral-prepared female nurse researcher with experience working with and recruiting women with PCOS, and the second author (R.M.D.), a female qualitative methodologist and nurse practitioner familiar with PCOS medical management. Interview guides were specifically developed to address knowledge, facilitators, and barriers of PA,19,30 SDT psychological needs,
23
 and strategies to increase motivation. Meetings were conducted by P.J.W. and audio-recorded via Zoom, a cloud-based videoconferencing service. Zoom offers the ability to communicate in real-time with participants in different geographic locations via computer or mobile device. This platform was chosen because it has several privacy features including user authentication, secure recording and storage, and real-time meeting encryption. Field notes were made during the focus group meetings. The recordings were transcribed and then compared to the audio to ensure that they accurately represented the participants’ discussion. Each participant received a $20 e-gift card per meeting for their time and expertise.
      
      
        Data analysis
        Using theory-driven thematic analysis,
31
 the data were organized and categorized based on predetermined themes drawn from SDT. Two researchers (P.J.W. and R.M.D.) independently coded the responses using deductive reasoning according to the three SDT psychological needs. Subsequently, an iterative categorization process was followed to organize data according to theoretical constructs. The two researchers discussed data saturation and unanimously agreed that data saturation had been reached after the three focus group meetings. Rigor was strengthened through the reflexivity of the researchers via reflexive journaling and regular meetings to discuss personal experiences and knowledge of both PCOS and PA in relation to the statements of the focus group participants. Rigor was further enhanced by following COREQ guidelines

      Results
      Participants (n = 7) represented three U.S. states (South Carolina, Georgia, and Texas) and four different counties in South Carolina, both rural and suburban. Participants were 33.9 (±8.1) years of age, mostly White (71%), married (86%), and employed full-time (86%). The participants’ mean depressive symptom score was 6.4 (±3.4), indicating “mild depression.” Participants’ characteristics are listed in Table 1.

      The PHQ-8 scores of the three participants who reported depression as a comorbidity corresponded.
      All focus group participants acknowledged the multiple health benefits of exercise. However, all reported being insufficiently active, that is, they did not regularly accumulate 150 min of moderate intensity PA most days of the week. All focus group participants reported using extrinsic motivation to make decisions about PA behavior. For example, one participant was motivated by incentives such as discounts on facility memberships and another participant was motivated by her physician’s guidance to lose weight. No participant represented amotivation nor fully self-determined intrinsic motivation. When asked to rank the SDT psychological needs in general, focus group participants unanimously agreed that relatedness was most important, with mixed responses about whether competence or autonomy would follow.
      Themes were deductively categorized by the three psychological needs of SDT. A fourth theme, motivational strategies, comprised focus group participants’ suggestions for improving exercise motivation. Quotes illuminating the themes are italicized and presented as stated by the focus group participants and are minimally edited for clarity (e.g. removal of dysfluencies). Participants’ initial and age follow each quote.
      
        Autonomy: And it was something else that hindered me
        Autonomy is the volitional choice and control of one’s behavior. Internal and external factors impact autonomy by creating shifts in perception of priorities. The women filled multiple roles (e.g. spouse, mother, daughter, employee, student, patient), resulting in daily competing time demands. As a result, the women felt a loss of control in their ability to schedule time for PA: My barrier is time.
        
Life just got in the way. (M, 41)Other barriers, children, family, school, blah, blah, blah, blah get in the way. (C, 37)My biggest struggle is making the time and making that a priority over other things. (S, 29)

        As women who struggle with PCOS, some women expressed being robbed of choice due to comorbid conditions, such as hidradenitis suppurativa (inflamed and infected sweat glands; n = 1) and depression (n = 3).
        
Other factors that go with PCOS impede physical activity. Hidradenitis suppurativa is one of those factors. So the sweat glands may become clogged, they break out into boils and they have to be surgically removed. So the more you sweat, the more there’s pain. (M, 42)It (PCOS) was affecting me mentally . . . so like depression and just like . . . hopelessness. Um, so, you know, I never exercised. (J, 23)

        Hyperandrogenism is a feature of PCOS with physical sequelae such as obesity, hirsutism, and acne. Several women expressed feeling “unattractive” and having poor self-image, which led to avoidance of PA in public places.
        
You hate your body and you feel fat all the time. (T, 24)

        Autonomous choices were also limited by facility location and costs.
        
And the next closest one (gym) is 30 minutes away. (C, 37)And so there’s also the monetary component to it as well. (M, 42)

      
      
        Competence: (Lack of weight loss) crushed my spirit. And, ever since then, I haven’t tried to do anything
        Competence involves the sense of mastery and self-efficacy of one’s behavior and the need to feel effective when performing that behavior. A person will more likely accomplish a task or meet a goal when feeling capable of successfully performing the related activities, or when the task results in the expected outcome.
        
[Exercise] gave me a sense of accomplishment. (J, 23)It’s (the body) working correctly and everything’s going great and you’re powerful, I think that’s the most rewarding thing about it. (S, 29)

        When one feels ineffective, incompetent, or unable to accomplish a task or goal, the effort may seem meaningless.

So I will not do a group because I have no rhythm. I can’t do anything like that. (M, 41)It’s depressing when you don’t see your results, you don’t want to try anymore. (C, 41)

        Focus group participants cited weight loss as the most salient reason to both start and stop a PA. Weight loss was prioritized based on body dissatisfaction and physician advice.
        
I want to lose weight. I don’t like my body. (C, 41)The doctor says, “Well just lose weight, a lot of your symptoms will be fixed.” Wouldn’t it be nice to know how? (M, 42)

      
      
        Relatedness: We are in it together
        Relatedness is the interpersonal dimension, reflecting the extent to which a person feels connected to and accepted by others and has caring relationships.
32

        
I can’t do it on my own. (S, 29)just like family in general or anyone who will just go on that journey with you (M, 41)

        Focus group participants explicitly stated the need for social contact(s) who can relate to or understand PCOS and its physical and mental consequences.
        
just someone who understands what you’re going through and who is someone who is also knowledgeable about PCOS. (C, 41)

        Participants discussed that groups, even groups with all women, were intimidating because they felt less feminine and less of a woman compared to others.
        
They don’t have it (PCOS) so they don’t get it. I compare myself to them and feel less of a woman. I’m big, have all this hair, can’t have a baby. (S, 29)

      
      
        Motivational Strategies: I’ve, like everybody, tried all kinds of different things and I’ve liked some and I’ve not liked some
        Focus group participants listed potential motivational strategies to promote and sustain PA as a healthy lifestyle behavior. For example, one participant stated that coaching (the support) increased her competence, which in turn enabled autonomy to make exercise choices that accommodated limited time and space. Each motivational support caters to one or more psychological needs. For example, the motivational support of people affects the need for relatedness; a service support affects the need for competence; the motivational support of technology mostly affects the need for autonomy, whereas the motivational support of behavioral change strategies affects all three needs. The motivational strategies presented by the focus group are listed in order of importance to the participants and with stated advantages and disadvantages of each in relation to general and PCOS-specific PA barriers (Table 3).

      Discussion
      Women with PCOS encounter general and PCOS-specific exercise barriers. According to SDT, the cultural context of PCOS necessitates meaningful motivational strategies to help meet psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In turn, as needs are met, motivation to engage in PA becomes more intrinsic. The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze PA barriers through the lens of SDT, a motivation theory, and identify motivational strategies that may promote PA initiation and maintenance from the perspective of women with PCOS. The discussion is organized by the three innate SDT psychological needs and then motivational strategies that may promote need satisfaction and increase PA motivation.
      
        Autonomy
        Focus group participants expressed that volitional choice to be physically active followed other priorities, such as family demands. The focus group participants detailed many competing time commitments. Although this is probably true for many people, the women with PCOS desired strategies to best incorporate PA given both life demands (e.g. family) and PCOS-specific needs (e.g. grooming rituals, physical comorbidities). The concept of little to no discretionary time to participate in activities that build social and human capital is referred to as time poverty.
33
 Time poverty encourages unhealthy behaviors, (e.g. buying fast food) which creates a cyclic pattern of defeat or learned helplessness.
33
 Time poverty is not necessarily a mismatch between responsibilities and available hours, but a mental outlook on the value of those hours.
33
 A creative way to “fund time” is changing perspective about the value of time, such as giving time a financial equivalent and then budgeting time and money together.
33

        Focus group participants described responsibilities beyond the traditional definition of paid employment, such as childrearing, caregiving for aging parents, and other family obligations. Women in developed and developing nations spend, respectively, an average of 2 and 3.4 times more hours per day than men on unpaid work shouldering the heaviest burden of cooking, cleaning, and caring for children and the elderly.
34
 This inequitable gender-based allocation of unpaid domestic work, representing “double-duty” for women who enter the workforce, often limits discretionary time for women and promotes self-neglect.
35
 While this finding is not unique to women with PCOS, other researchers reported that women with PCOS more strongly adhere to cultural female gender roles to reclaim a feminine identity.
36

        The systemic oppression of women via gender inequality is accompanied by restrictive gender norms dictating societal female expectations, including the gender-specific ideals permeated about a woman’s presentation and gender performativity.
37
 The focus group participants frequently mentioned hirsutism and obesity as PCOS aspects causing stigma-related stress. Pfister and Romer found similar results when they interviewed Danish women with PCOS, all who perceived their bodies as different from femininity norms.
38
 Negative self-evaluation of bodyweight and shape can lead to low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and social phobia.
39
 More and Phillips also found that body dissatisfaction led to less autonomous regulation among women, which led to less frequent PA.
40
 Lastly, several of the participants in the current study reported lack of autonomy due to physical and mental features imposed by PCOS (e.g. obesity, hidradenitis suppurativa, depressive symptoms). Some conditions could be circumvented by choosing alternative forms of PA. For example, the participant with hidradenitis suppurativa chose swimming versus traditional cardiovascular exercise such as walking to avoid hot environments and thus an aggravating factor of excessive perspiration. Recent meta-analyses indicate that PA can significantly improve psychological well-being among people with depressive symptoms.
8

However, focus group participants stated that depression caused lack of energy and drive to be physically active. Screening for depressive symptoms and providing resources may be an essential first step before prescribing PA as therapeutic management. Longitudinal studies assessing PA and subjective well-being have shown that greater well-being predicts maintained or increased activity over time,
41
 and that changes in leisure-time exercise predict changes in happiness.
42

      
      
        Competence
        Focus group participants relayed clinical encounters and public health messaging that issued absent or confusing directives for weight loss. Clinical guidance for weight loss often excludes accurate and more detailed information about the role of exercise for weight loss as PA alone will not produce quick weight loss.
43
 PA enhances the ability to lose weight over time but mostly confers metabolic benefits.
44
 Accurate and specific guidance about realistic goal expectations increases knowledge and builds self-efficacy.
        In addition to accurate and detailed information, individuals must experience success with a behavior to build confidence in their actions.
45
 Positive behavioral experiences build self-efficacy, which in turn facilitates perceived competence for the behavior.
45
 Goal reframing is one strategy to establish other expected and more immediate health outcomes such as improved endurance, increased strength, and improved sleep. Recognizing more immediate health outcomes as goals and subsequently meeting those goals increases the likelihood for sustained behavior change.
45
 Positive and informative feedback also increases perceived competence.
46

        Focus group participants reported physicians as a trusted source of information and competent care. However, physicians cite barriers to exercise counseling such as lack of clinical time, limited education about PA dosing, and the absence of a PA counseling protocol.
47

      
      
        Relatedness
        Several studies (correlational, longitudinal, experimental) revealed a strong positive correlation between sense of belongingness and life satisfaction and wellness.
48
 The focus group participants agreed. Focus group participants emphasized the need to be understood in the context of PCOS, which is consistent with previous literature about women with PCOS.
49
 Being socially connected is influential on psychological and emotional well-being and has a significant and positive influence on physical well-being and overall longevity.
50
 As social beings, people strive for social connection to feel accepted and supported and avoid isolation and loneliness. This sentiment was consistent with a series of experiments designed to examine types of social connection, in which people were motivated to perform a task based on “being understood” or “mere belonging.” Being understood was independent of casual acquaintance versus longstanding relationships with family or friends or one individual versus many people.
51
 Thus, strategies to enable relatedness for women with PCOS could include online peer support, a buddy system, or social support groups.
        Focus group participants ranked relatedness as the most important category when discussing motivational strategies to be more physically active. In a cross-sectional study of women with PCOS about PA perceptions, respondents reported a choice not to be physically active due to feelings of rejection, stigma, and isolation from a general lack of understanding from others about PCOS and its impact.
19
 In a similar study to ours, Dalgas et al. found that unmet needs of relatedness led to feelings of isolation and frustration that prohibited PA, especially in group settings.
52
 As the focus group participants discussed, relatedness is enhanced when there is understanding of PCOS specifically followed by consistent support from the source providing true understanding.
        The SDT literature emphasizes conducting a needs analysis to prioritize the psychological needs when designing tailored interventions for most populations.
53
 However, when considering the differential effects of the three psychological needs among women in general, relatedness contributed strongly to autonomy and competence while autonomy and competence did not impact relatedness. As such, behavioral interventions should consider prioritizing relatedness needs to affect all other needs and promote intervention efficacy among women with PCOS.,
      
      
        Interrelatedness of the psychological needs
        The three innate psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are also interrelated, as they each reinforce the other and work synergistically to contribute to overall well-being and promote more intrinsic motivation.
22

        
          Autonomy and competence
          Autonomy facilitates competence. As individuals choose behaviors that align with priorities and interests, they will invest time and effort in those activities or behaviors, leading to the development of competence. Conversely competence can enhance autonomy. As competence for a behavior increases, individuals are more likely to choose that behavior.
        
        
          Autonomy and relatedness
          Autonomy also involves the freedom to choose when and how to engage in social interactions. Voluntary social interactions are more likely to yield more authentic and meaningful connections with others. Perceived social support, especially types such as emotional and appraisal,
54
 can reinforce autonomous choice.
        
        
          Competence and relatedness
          Findings from information management research indicate that competence leads to knowledge sharing,
55
 which can create a sense of contribution to and connection with those receiving informational support.
56
 In turn, relatedness involves a social environment in which individuals can receive feedback, guidance, and support to fuel their competence and create reciprocal giving and mutual reciprocity.
57

        
      
      
        Motivational strategies
        Motivational strategies may serve to help meet one or more psychological needs. For example, a personal trainer (the support) may provide empathetic listening and feedback to meet both relatedness and competence needs. Whereas, a technological device, such as a smartwatch, may promote and individual to engage in PA through daily activity recording and self-competition, thus meeting the need of autonomy. Behavioral change strategies, such as proper goal setting, meet all three psychosocial needs, as a woman with PCOS must first choose a behavior (autonomy) which she feels confident to perform (competence) and then find one or more people or norms, or benchmarks for which to “compete” or compare (relatedness). The importance of relatedness for engaging in PA superseded autonomy and competence for this sample of women with PCOS. Focus group participants explicitly stated that they sought encouragement from strategies such as tips and success stories about PA and were more motivated by the support of people who had experiential or factual PCOS knowledge.
        Self-awareness is critical while traversing the dynamic life course.
58
 Behavioral self-regulation is the capacity to assess cognitive, affective, and/or behavioral responses to daily life in the context of a larger goal and adapt accordingly.
59
 Thus, motivational strategies may need to change or coexist to match life’s demands. For example, a woman with PCOS may benefit from a coach to enable competence and a technological device to promote accountability. The capacity to self-regulate and appropriately choose alternative motivational strategies are teachable skills. These skills could be taught by healthcare professionals, such as nurses or other ancillary staff.
      
      
        Implications for PA interventions and healthcare
        The findings of this qualitative study highlight implications for PA interventions for women with PCOS. SDT can be a suitable theory to underpin PA interventions to increase motivation for PA by recognizing the context of PCOS and including strategies to meet the women’s psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Developers of PA interventions, specifically within the health realm, could consider the comprehensive guides to SDT techniques complied by Teixeira et al.
46
 For example, to meet the need for autonomy, women with PCOS can be provided choice of activity and given responsibility to schedule the activity. Strategies to meet the need for competence could include goal setting, positive and process-focused feedback, and extrinsic rewards. The need for relatedness could include individual and/or group-level social support from peers with PCOS or healthcare professionals knowledgeable about PCOS. Such social support systems can provide women with PCOS understanding from others while avoiding stigma-related stress due to appearance.
        Healthcare professionals, as a trusted source of information, have a role in promoting PA to women with PCOS. They are in a unique position to recognize and reinforce healthy behaviors and the additional health-related outcomes from PA. Available resources, such as the “Exercise is Medicine,” an initiative launched by the American College of Sports Medicine in 2007, are available to healthcare providers. These resources include PA counseling scripts and PA protocols, thus enabling healthcare providers to prescribe PA as part of a treatment plan.
60
 One resource of the “Exercise is Medicine” initiative is the “PA level as a vital sign” strategy and form (https://www.exerciseismedicine.org/).
60
 Assessing PA as a vital sign at clinic visits could increase the value of PA among clinicians, encourage counseling about positive PA outcome expectations, and confirm the patients’ knowledge and efforts.
        Interventions that meet the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in PA for women with PCOS can lead to more autonomous motivation to be physically active. PA, performed regularly over time, will promote health outcomes by helping to manage PCOS symptoms and mitigating the risk of cardiometabolic health conditions.
      
      
        Limitations
        A limitation of this study was the small sample size of volunteer participants, which limits generalizability. Our recruitment goal was for 6–10 individuals to keep the group size manageable and the participants comfortable sharing their expertise while also achieving diversity of opinion. Additionally, the homogeneity the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics limits generalizability to the entire population of premenopausal women with PCOS. However, the statistics for demographics, PA, and body mass index matched those found in other U.S. studies of premenopausal women with PCOS, except for depressive symptomology. The participants, as a group, were categorized as having mild depressive symptomology compared to moderate in another U.S. PCOS study.
61
 Thus, the volunteer participants for this focus group may have been more motivated to meet and discuss PA and therefore may not be representative of the PCOS population. While the PHQ-8 scores were better than those in other U.S. studies involving women with PCOS, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the responses to the depressive symptom screening tool. None of the focus group participants were teenagers or women of peri-postmenopausal age or residing in other countries, further limiting generalizability to all women with PCOS. Some focus group participants (n = 3) were recruited from other PCOS studies, which can introduce bias, as these participants may be more interested in research. None of the participants reported meeting the guidelines for PA; however, they may have been more interested in PA as compared to the population of U.S. women with PCOS. A limitation was the lack of a validated tool to measure PA status among the participants. Due to COVID-19, meetings were held virtually. This was a strength as women from different geographic locations participated. However, one meeting was interrupted with technical challenges of a dropped call and pauses due to poor connectivity. Overall, the virtual platform was convenient and cost-effective, while providing an easier and more secure way to record and transcribe sessions. The data were collected in three virtual meetings, possibly limiting its depth. The interview guide was not pilot tested. The researchers analyzed each transcript immediately after meetings to check for data saturation. Only two researchers iteratively read all transcripts and worked to identify codes and sub-themes. However, a third researcher was available for any variance, and all authors reviewed the themes and supporting evidence.
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      PCOS is a chronic health condition requiring life-long management, and PA is a first-line treatment strategy. Enacting PA requires motivation. The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze PA barriers through the lens of SDT, a motivation theory, and identify strategies that may promote PA initiation and maintenance among women with PCOS.
      Findings from this study underscored that the cultural context of PCOS can undermine PA behavior. Motivational strategies can help meet the women’s psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness and promote PA adoption and maintenance. Assessments of cultural context and depressive symptoms, followed by skill-building (e.g. choosing alternative PA types and environmental settings), could precede a PA intervention to circumvent PA barriers. Lastly, focus group participants strongly emphasized the need to be understood by those who support their efforts to adopt and maintain PA. All focus group participants agreed that social support from one or more people with factual or experiential PCOS knowledge would enable motivation. Such motivational strategies could include a peer coach, a community support group, or an invested healthcare team to provide accountability and encouragement.

Title: Rationale and design of the GLADE study: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in endometriosis-related pelvic pain

Abstract: AbstractBackgroundPelvic pain secondary to endometriosis is a disabling condition. There are multiple treatments available, with variable endpoints. No prospective controlled studies were carried out evaluating subdermal pellets of gestrinone in this population.MethodsOne hundred participants with documented deep infiltrative endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either gestrinone 85 mg subdermal bioabsorbable pellets or placebo. Both arms will receive levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12). The treatment duration will be 6 months, with baseline, 3 months and 6 months clinical visits. The primary endpoint is a combination of serious adverse events (SAEs) accumulated within 6 months of insertion of the gestrinone or placebo pellet and collected through spontaneous reports and clinical findings. They include death, threat or risk to life, need for hospitalization, prolongation of pre-existing hospitalization, permanent disability or damage, congenital anomaly; or significant medical occurrences such as venous thromboembolism. The primary safety outcome will be the percentage of patients who do not experience SAEs 6 months after randomization. Androgenization, changes in laboratory exams and in pelvic pain intensity as well as quality of life (SF-36 and EHP-30 questionnaires) will be further evaluated. Daily data on uterine bleeding patterns and the use of pain relief medication will be remotely collected using an App. Pharmacokinetics profile of gestrinone pellet will be characterized.ConclusionThis is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile of subdermal gestrinone pellets and might inform clinical practice for treating these patients.Administrative InformationGLADE trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05570786). This is an investigator-initiated research supported by Biòs Farmacêutica.

Body: Introduction
      Pelvic pain is a disabling condition for women of reproductive age, negatively impacting their quality of life and work efficiency. Doctors frequently neglect it despite its estimated worldwide prevalence ranging from 5.6 to 26.6 [1,2]. Pelvic pain is considered a symptom of multifactorial origin in which endometriosis is the leading gynecological cause that affects 5–10% of women in their reproductive years. It means around 176 million women with endometriosis worldwide [3].
      Surgical and hormonal treatments with variable endpoints are available and are still considered a significant challenge for medicine. Recommendations from different medical guidelines for managing the disease include surgery or a combination of surgical and pharmacological strategies [4–6]. Hormone therapy includes progestogens, anti-progestogens, combined oral contraceptives, gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, GnRH antagonists, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), danazol and aromatase inhibitors. The choice of treatment for endometriosis must consider the severity of the symptoms, extent, and location of the lesions, comorbidities, age, intention to become pregnant, adverse drug events, and contraindications. Surgical treatment is indicated in the case of severe and disabling symptoms without improvement after the pharmacological treatment. However, post-surgery recurrence rate of painful symptoms is 21.5% after 2 year and 40–50% after 5 years of the surgery [4–6]. The direct costs for treatment of endometriosis are significant. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in 2021 registered 26,400 medical appointments and 8,000 hospitalizations for endometriosis with limited access to multifunctional teams specialized in endometriosis and longtime waiting for a surgery [7]. In this context, pharmacological treatment for endometriosis is prominent.
      A Cochrane Review about progestagens and anti-progestagens for pain associated with endometriosis showed gestrinone as anti-progestogen (i.e. a substance that prevents cells from making or using progesterone) and one of the first drugs for the treatment of endometriosis and myomas [8]. Gestrinone acts centrally on the hypothalamic pituitary system by suppressing the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Both continuous progestogens and continuous gestrinone are effective therapies for the treatment of painful symptoms associated with endometriosis. There was no overall evidence of a benefit of one oral progestogen over another. However, this conclusion must be treated with caution due to the lack of placebo-controlled studies [8]. The World Endometriosis Society (WES) [5] and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) [6] guidelines discuss the use of gestrinone as a possible medication for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain. Gestrinone should be used for those whom other treatments have proven ineffective despite potential treatment-associated adverse effects [5]. However, there is still a lack of quality evidence from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.
      GLADE (Gestrinone peLlet AnD Endometriosis) Study is a decentralized, patient-centered, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical study to primarily evaluate the safety and tolerability of subdermal gestrinone bioabsorbable pellet in the treatment of pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis. With this study, we hope to advance the knowledge about gestrinone subdermal pellets, their possible side effects, pharmacokinetics profile and their ability to alleviate pain and improve quality of life of women with endometriosis.
      
        Gestrinone compound profile
        
          Physicochemical properties and pharmaceutical formulation
          3-ethyl-17-hydroxy-18,19-dinor-17α-pregna-4,9,11-trien-20-yn-one, known as gestrinone, ethylnorgestrienone or R-2323 is a synthetic derivative of 19-nortestosterone developed in 1960 originally as a contraceptive and has been studied as a treatment for leiomyoma and endometriosis [9]. It is a compound with the molecular formula C21H24O2 and a molecular weight 308.4.14.
        
        
          Mechanism of action
          The mechanism of action of gestrinone is complex and multimediated. It inhibits folliculogenesis and acts on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, preventing the increase in gonadotropins (FSH and LH) in the middle of the ovulatory cycle, causing estrogen inhibition, anovulation, and amenorrhea. It has an affinity for progesterone and estrogen receptors and a low affinity for androgen receptors while at the same time inducing a reduction in the expression of progesterone receptors [10]. It can reduce the production of SHBG (Sex-hormone binding globulin), which causes an increase in blood levels of free testosterone and progesterone, leading to the emergence of their androgenic effects [11].
        
        
          Metabolization and excretion
          After oral administration, gestrinone has a serum half-life of around 24 h, undergoing active hepatic metabolism essentially by hydroxylation, and its metabolic conjugates are eliminated through urine (40–45%) and feces (30–35%) [12].
        
        
          Side effects
          Most of the adverse effects of gestrinone are due to its androgenic activity and include acne, skin and hair seborrhea, mild hirsutism, edema, weight gain, voice changes, androgenetic alopecia, and clitoral hypertrophy. The drug showed an embryotoxic effect on animals, with a risk of androgenization of female fetuses. It reduces HDL concentrations, and it is recommended to monitor cholesterol and liver transaminase levels in hyperlipidemic patients and glucose levels in diabetic patients. Other effects related to inhibition of the pituitary-ovarian axis may include menstrual disorders and amenorrhea, hot flashes, sweating, breast reduction, changes in libido, vaginal dryness, and emotional fluctuations [13].
        
        
          Clinical evidence
          Previous clinical studies evaluating gestrinone and endometriosis are scarce. A study by Diaz et al. (1977) assessed the contraceptive effect of the subdermal gestrinone implant in Chilean women for 12 months, as well as the emergence of possible adverse events. The authors reported a potent inhibitory effect on fertility in patients, which was accompanied by an increase in transaminases and the appearance of acne, headaches, and hirsutism [14].
          Oral treatment with gestrinone (2.5 to 5 mg twice a week) induced improvement in symptoms associated with endometriosis without the need for daily administration of the drug, which is usually required in similar conservative therapies, representing an option for treatment of the disease. Furthermore, patients treated vaginally tend to have fewer androgenic adverse events such as acne, seborrhea, and weight gain than those treated orally [15].
          Worthington et al. (1993) evaluated the effects of oral gestrinone (1.25 and 2.5 mg twice a week for 6 months) on some metabolic parameters of women with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. The study concluded that the drug was effective in treating the disease without inducing any loss of bone density but caused unfavorable effects on serum lipids and lipoproteins that were reversed 6 months after the end of treatment [16].
          A randomized clinical study involving 43 women with endometriosis compared 6 months of treatment with gestrinone (5 mg per week) or buserelin nasal spray (300 µg every 8 h) with a 5-year follow-up and found that both treatments were effective in remitting endometriosis. There were reports of acne and vascular events such as edema and heaviness in the lower limbs in the group that received gestrinone [17].
          In 1996, The Gestrinone Italian Group Study compared oral treatment with gestrinone and leuprolide acetate for pelvic pain in women with endometriosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical study, concluding that both were equally effective. However, gestrinone did not affect the patient’s bone density despite inducing fluctuations in serum lipid values [18].
          Trials evaluating gestrinone in the form of a gel for vaginal application (Gestrinone Pentravan®) for the treatment of endometriosis have also been carried out and report positive effects of the drug in relieving refractory pain [19].
          Subdermal gestrinone bioabsorbable pellet could be a safe and effective alternative for treating endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and minimize adverse events observed with oral administration.
        
      
      
        Objectives
        
          Primary objective
          To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response.
        
        
          Secondary safety objectives
          To evaluate the potential for androgenization of the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response.
        
        
          Other exploratory objectives
          To compare the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet versus placebo pellet on participant satisfaction, change in pelvic pain intensity, use of pain relief medication, uterine bleeding pattern and quality of life. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of gestrinone will be characterized in a subgroup of participants.
        
      
    
    
      Patients and methods
      The report of this study protocol follow the SPIRIT (standard protocol items: Recommendations for interventional trials) 2013 guidelines [20].
      
        Study design
        The first participant was included on February 25th 2023 and the last patient last visit is estimated for April 2025. The laboratory analysis for measurement of gestrinone plasma levels are undergoing. We will carry a decentralized, patient-centered, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. The study will be conducted in 7 research centers in Brazil (hospital and clinics).
        The study protocol has several innovations to increase participant recruitment and retention such as the organization of disease awareness campaigns and the participation of a patient representative as member of the Trial Steering Committee. Participant representative provided information about the burden of the disease and the impact of the treatment through a patient perspective that enabled the inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in the study protocol. An App will be used to remotely collect diary registries about uterine bleeding pattern and use of analgesics for pain relief and other adverse events in real time.

            Protocol innovations.
          
          
        
        The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB – Comitê de Ética Hospital Leforte, CAAE: 64457622.5.1001.5485, Approval Number: 5.748.523, Dated: November 9th, 2022). The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at all research sites. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before any study procedure is applied. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05570786). The first participant was included on February 25th 2023 and the last patient last visit is estimated for April 2025.
        The study protocol is composed of two stages: 1) Main protocol: randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, N = 100 participants, treatment duration and follow-up: 6 months; 2) Extension-PK (EXT-PK): open-label, N = 15 participants (subgroup of participants who concluded the main protocol and accepted to receive the treatment; follow-up: 6 months. The study design is depicted in Figure 2.

            Study design.
          
          
        
        Participants eligible for the main stage of the study will be randomized into one of the treatment arms:Experimental: Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) and gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet (85 mg)Comparator: Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) Kyleena® levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and subdermal implant of placebo bioabsorbable pellet
        The insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) is necessary as a contraceptive method for all study participants. LNG-IUS (LNG-IUS 12) has been developed for up to 5 years of use with an average release rate of ∼12 μg/24 h over the first year [21]. Clinical assessments will be recorded at recruitment (baseline), 3 and 6 months after pellet insertion. Assessment of the primary outcome will be carried out 6 months after insertion of the gestrinone pellet.
        Participants will be invited to an extension phase (open-label) of the study to provide additional long-term safety data (EXT-PK). A subgroup of 15 participants at the end of 6 months of the main stage of the study who accept to participate in the extension phase will receive an insertion of a gestrinone pellet (85 mg), and the serum concentration of gestrinone will be monitored to characterize its pharmacokinetic profile (PK). Clinical assessments will be recorded at recruitment (baseline), 1, 3 and 6 months after pellet insertion. Blood sampling for PK study will be conducted.
        Bioabsorbable gestrinone pellets are produced and marketed by Biòs Farmacêutica following standardized procedures and current legislation. Pellets containing a placebo will be prepared under the same conditions as those containing the product ingredient. Biòs Farmacêutica will donate all pellets used in this study.
        GLADE is an investigator-initiated project. Biòs Farmacêutica funded the trial but was not involved in the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, writing of the manuscript, or decision to publish. The Trial Steering Committee designed the study protocol and is monitoring the trial’s progress. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first and the last author and revised based on comments from all the authors. No writing assistance was provided.
      
      
        Patients
        The study will enroll 100 women with refractory pain control who underwent surgery for endometriosis at least 3 months ago and who had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of deep infiltrative endometriosis. Eligible participants are women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis surgically treated with refractory symptoms, independent of pain intensity. .Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain includes dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain.
        Study participants have a medical history of indication for surgery as an option to reduce endometriosis associated-pain after having been failed to standard hormone treatment (combined hormonal contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists or GnRH antagonists). Surgeries were conducted to fully eliminate endometriotic lesions from both the posterior compartment and anterior compartment, as well as from bowel compartment whenever present.
        Detailed eligibility criteria are listed in Table 1.

      Study endpoints
      
        Primary safety outcome
        It is a combination of serious adverse events (SAEs) accumulated within 6 months of insertion of the gestrinone or placebo pellet and collected through spontaneous reports and clinical findings. The primary safety outcome will be the percentage of patients who do NOT experience SAEs 6 months after randomization.
        SAEs are unfavorable medical events that result in any of the following outcomes:DeathThreat or risk to lifeNeed for hospitalizationProlongation of pre-existing hospitalizationPermanent disability or damageCongenital anomaly; orSignificant medical occurrences that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may harm the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the other occurrences mentioned. In this study, the occurrence of thromboembolic events (such as, for example, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack) was pre-defined as a significant medical occurrence.
      
      
        Secondary safety outcomes [timepoints: pre-pellet insertion assessment, 3 and 6 months after gestrinone or placebo pellet insertion]
        The main secondary safety outcome will be defined as the number of participants who experience androgenization defined by:Hirsutism: defined by Ferriman-Gallwey Score ≥ 8Clitoromegaly: defined by Clitoral index ≥ 35 mm2Acne: defined by the IGA scale (Investigator’s global assessment) grade 5 – severe inflammatory acne dominates the area, and there are many comedones, pustules, papules, and cystic acneAlopecia with sequelae of scalp thinningDeepening of the voice
      
      
        Other secondary safety endpoints [timepoints: pre-pellet insertion assessment and 3 months after gestrinone or placebo pellet insertion]
        The number of participants who experience:Laboratory values outside the reference range and clinically relevant for serum hormone concentrations (total testosterone, free testosterone, and SHBG)Clinically significant change in total cholesterol, HDL-C, VLDL-C, and triglycerides from baselineHematological disorders with recent onset, defined as: decreased lymphocyte count < 500/mm3 (or < 0.5 × 109/l); decreased neutrophil count < 500/mm3 (or < 0.5 × 109/l); decreased platelet count < 30,000/mm3 (or < 30.0 × 109/l); and anemia with decreased Hb < 7.0 g/dl (or < 4.35 mmol/l)Hepatic adverse events (increase in ALT or AST > 3 times the ULN or baseline values or total bilirubin > 2 times the ULN or baseline values or suspected hepatocellular or cholestatic hepatotoxicity)Renal adverse events e.g. confirmed increase in serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 times the ULN or baseline values; a clinically significant decrease in creatinine clearance; a clinically significant increase in serum urea; and new onset of proteinuria
      
      
        Exploratory efficacy endpoints [timepoints: pre-pellet insertion assessment, 3 and/or 6 months after gestrinone or placebo pellet insertion]
        Exploratory efficacy endpoints are defined as:Median participant satisfaction (ranging from 1 to 5, from very satisfied to very dissatisfied) – assessmentMedian intensity of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea assessed by the VAS scaleProportion of participants who used medication to relieve pelvic painMedian number of days that participant used medication to relieve pelvic painChange in uterine bleeding patternProportion of participants with a change in Health-related Quality of Life measured with the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey Form (SF-36)Average change in total score and score for each domain of the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey Form (SF-36)Proportion of participants with changes in the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP- 30 The Endometriosis Health Profile) scoreAverage change in the total score and the score of each domain of the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP- 30 The Endometriosis Health Profile)
      
      
        Other exploratory outcomes
        The pharmacokinetic profile of gestrinone will be characterized in a subgroup of participants (N = 15). The pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined: area under the curve (AUC(0-∞)), maximum concentration (Cmax), time until reaching maximum concentration (Tmax), and half-life (t1/2).
      
      
        Assessment of outcomes measures
        Outcomes measures will be assessed during each of the three study visits in the main study protocol (randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled stage), including a baseline visit (pre-treatment), a 3-month visit and 6-month visit. A trained team, including a gynecologist, will conduct the study in the outpatient setting in all study centers. Clinical assessments, monitoring of adverse events, evaluation of androgenization (hirsutism, clitoral index, acne, alopecia, and deepening of the voice), as well as pelvic pain intensity and quality of life assessed by SF-36 questionnaire will be evaluated at all the three study visits. Laboratory blood assessment will be conducted at the baseline visit and in the 3-month visit and include: complete blood count, liver and kidney function (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, urea, creatinine, and uric acid), lipid profile (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL) and blood glucose, coagulogram (PT and aPTT), and plasma hormone levels (total testosterone, free testosterone, and SHBG). Quality of life assessment by the EHP-30 questionnaire will be applied at the baseline visit and in the 3-month visit. Data on uterine bleeding pattern and use of medication to relieve pelvic pain will be remotely collected using and electronic diary available at the App used in the study protocol.
        Outcomes measures in the EXT-PK (open-label) will be assessed during each of the four study visits in which clinical evaluation, monitoring of adverse events, evaluation of androgenization, pelvic pain intensity and quality of life by SF-36 questionnaire will be conducted in each of the clinical visits, including baseline (pre-treatment), 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month after the insertion of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet. Blood sampling for PK study will be conducted: pre-insertion of the gestrinone pellet (predose); different times after insertion of the gestrinone pellet: +24h; 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168 days. Data on uterine bleeding pattern and use of medication to relieve pelvic pain will be remotely collected using an electronic diary established to be available at the App established to be used in the study protocol.
      
      
        Study procedures
        Participant-reported outcomes will be collected via the App used in the study protocol: Quality of Life 36-item Form Health Survey (SF-36); endometriosis health profile – Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30); diary to record the use of analgesics for pelvic pain and uterine bleeding pattern. On the first visit, access to the App will be provided to the participant; the participant will receive guidance on how to use the App, and baseline data will be collected. Following the study procedure schedule, participants will receive reminders through the App to record outcomes, and telephone contact will be made for those who do not complete the form regularly. At follow-up visits, participants will be retrained if they present difficulties in using it.
      
    
    
      Screening procedures
      
        Gynecological assessment
        A gynecological assessment will be carried out to check the conditions of the female reproductive tract and the suitability for the insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12). Furthermore, menstrual history, hormone use, pregnancy, and fertility history will be collected. A transvaginal ultrasound will be performed to assess the positioning of the device.
      
      
        Treatments
        
          Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12)
          The LNG-IUS 12 (Kyleena®) must be inserted in an outpatient setting by the investigator following the manufacturer instructions. After carrying out a gynecological examination to check the size and position of the uterus, the cervix should be visualized with the aid of a speculum, and the cervix and the vagina should be cleaned with an antiseptic solution. With the help of the sliding guide, the IUS inserter must be pushed to the bottom of the uterus to position the device.
        
        
          Insertion of the investigational product or subdermal bioabsorbable placebo pellet
          The investigator will conduct the procedure in an outpatient setting. After local anesthesia, a small incision (4–5 mm) will be made, through which the pellet will be inserted under the skin of the buttock using a trocar. It will be performed just after the insertion of the LNG-IUS 12, and the randomization procedure.
        
      
      
        Safety and efficacy endpoint assessments
        Suspected events and outcomes must be analyzed by the Clinical Events Classification Committee. Safety results should be indicated on the eCRF clinical status page and should be submitted for review.
      
      
        Laboratory evaluation
        Blood samples (total volume of 10 mL) will be collected through venipuncture from the participant in the following tubes: tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant to perform the blood count, tubes with separating gel (to evaluate biochemical parameters of liver and kidney function, hormonal and lipid profile) or citrate (to perform a coagulogram), observing a prior 8-hour fast. After separating the serum, dosages will be carried out using commercially available kits following the instructions specified by the manufacturer. The local laboratory will conduct the analyses using its protocols and equipment and following Biosafety Standards and Good Laboratory Practices.
      
    
    
      Assessment of androgenization
      
        Hirsutism
        The investigator will assess the degree of hirsutism. The participant should be instructed to suspend hair removal/waxing for approximately 14 days before each visit. The use of lasers for hair removal will not be permitted during the entire study period. To evaluate and quantify hirsutism, the modified Ferriman-Gallwey Scoring System will be used, which includes 9 body regions (excluding the legs and armpits) for access to hair growth, grading from 0 (no terminal hair growth) to 4 (extensive hair growth) in 9 locations. The total score ranges from 0 to 36, with a score greater than 8 considered a sign of androgen excess in Caucasian women. A score of 8 – 15 indicates mild hirsutism; above 15, moderate to severe hirsutism. For other ethnic groups, the amount of hair expected for each specific ethnicity must be considered [22].
      
      
        Clitoris measurement
        The investigator will measure the participant’s clitoris (portion corresponding to the glans) [23]. The size of the clitoris will be measured using a 15 cm plastic ruler. The Clitoridean Index will be considered as the product of the longitudinal diameter (in millimeters) x transverse diameter (in millimeters), considering clitoromegaly when these measurements are more significant than 6.5 and 4.4 respectively, and the Clitoridean Index greater than 35 mm2 [24]. Additionally, the participant’s clitoris corresponding to the part of glans + corpus will be measured and registered.
      
      
        Deepening of the voice
        A speech therapist will evaluate the participant’s vocal pattern using protocols and equipment validated by evaluating professionals. The participant’s voice will be recorded using a digital recorder for evaluation. The pattern observed on each visit will always be compared with that recorded during the initial visit (Basal) to detect possible vocal changes and, more specifically, the deepening of the voice.
      
      
        Assessment of the degree of acne
        The severity of acne will be assessed
        By using the IGA scale (Investigator’s global assessment) to be used by the trained researcher and described below:0 – Clear skin: no evidence of acne1 – Almost clear skin: some inflammatory lesions and some non-inflamed papules present (developing papules, without redness yet)2 – Moderately severe acne: some non-inflammatory lesions dominate the area with some pustules and papules (there are no cystic lesions)3 – Non-inflammatory acne dominates the area, and some inflammatory lesions can be found. There may or may not be a small cystic lesion in the area,4 – Inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions are more visible. There may or may not be some cystic acne lesions.5 – Severe inflammatory acne dominates the area. Many comedones, pustules, papules, and cystic acne will be present.
      
    
    
      Alopecia
      The investigator will assess the occurrence of alopecia according to the presence of rarefaction sequelae on the scalp.
      
        Uterine bleeding or bleeding-free days
        The participant must record in the electronic diary (App) whether there has been uterine bleeding in the last 24 h. If the answer is positive, she must inform us of the intensity of the bleeding (whether spotting or bleeding). Based on the data documented in the participant’s diary, the following parameters will be evaluated:Total number of days of amenorrheaTotal number of bleeding-free days in the reference periodTotal number of days of bleeding and spotting (escape)Total number of days with bleeding or spotting in the reference periodNumber of consecutive bleeding-free daysNumber of consecutive days without bleeding after starting treatmentTotal number of days with spotting (escape)Total number of days with spotting (escape) in the reference periodTotal number of days to cessation of bleeding after starting treatment
        The bleeding pattern will be classified according to the criteria of Belsey [25] described below: normal bleeding − 3 to 5 episodes of spotting or bleeding within 90 days; prolonged bleeding – more than 14 days of continuous spotting or bleeding within 90 days; frequent bleeding – more than 14 days of constant spotting or bleeding within 90 days; infrequent bleeding – less than 3 episodes of spotting or bleeding within 90 days; amenorrhea – no bleeding during the 90 days of the reference period.
      
      
        Assessment of changes in the intensity of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea based on the Visual Analogue scale (VAS/EVA)
        The study participants will receive a diagram based on the Visual Analogue Scale shown below to assess chronic non-cyclical pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. The VAS scale is standardized from 0 (no pain) to 10 (in centimeters) (the worst pain imaginable).
      
      
        Record of pre-study and concomitant medications
        At the screening visit, pre-study medication use will be recorded. The participant must record in the electronic diary through the App used in the study about the use of concomitant medications, especially for pain relief (analgesics).
      
      
        Assessment of patient-reported quality of life
        The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Form Health Survey (SF-36) measured health-related quality of life. Participants must respond to the SF-36 questionnaire. The SF-36 is a multidimensional questionnaire containing 36 items distributed into 8 components: functional capacity, physical aspects, pain, general health status, vitality, social and emotional aspects, and mental health. It has a final score that ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to the worst general health status and 100 to the best health status [26].
      
    
    
      Endometriosis health profile 30 (EHP-30)
      Participants must respond to the EHP-30 questionnaire. The EHP-30 is a self-report instrument that measures how endometriosis affects a woman’s health status and quality of life. It consists of a central questionnaire composed of 30 items that access 5 dimensions: pain, control and helplessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image; and a modular questionnaire with 23 items distributed across 6 scales: sexual relations, work, medical profession, infertility, relationship with children and treatment. Each scale is transformed into a score from 0 to 100, with the lowest score meaning a better quality of life [27].
      
        Patient satisfaction with treatment
        Participants must rate their satisfaction with the treatment by choosing one of the following alternatives presented in written form (ranging from 1 to 5): very satisfied, satisfied, not sure, dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied.
      
      
        Pharmacokinetic profile of gestrinone
        Blood sampling will be conducted at pre-insertion of the gestrinone pellet; different times after insertion of the gestrinone pellet: +24h; 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168 days
        A sensitive and specific high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated by a local specialized laboratory for the determination of gestrinone in human serum using nomegestrol acetate-d5 as an internal standard. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.05 ng/mL.
        The pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated: area under the curve (AUC(0-∞)), maximum concentration (Cmax), time until reaching maximum concentration (Tmax), and half-life (t1/2).
      
      
        Reports of pregnancy
        Participants should be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they become pregnant during the study. The investigator must report any pregnancy in study participants that occurs within 30 days of the last administration of the investigational product.
      
      
        Randomization and allocation concealment
        Participants will be randomized into one of the study arms in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with gestrinone or placebo, stratified by center. According to an electronically predefined randomization list, participants will be assigned to a treatment group (RedCap, version 11.0.3). Participants are randomly allocated to one of the study arms, and neither the investigator nor the study participants influence the allocation of participants to the groups (blinding).
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Statistical analysis will be carried out by researchers independently. Summaries by treatment group will be provided using appropriate descriptive statistics for all study variables. Descriptive statistics such as mean ± standard deviation median (minimum-maximum) will summarize continuous variables. Categorical variables will be summarized as the proportions of each category. Graphical data presentation can also be used to summarize data. The values of the scores and indices will be compared with the baseline values (baseline = pre-treatment) using the paired t-test and Wilcoxon test. Changes in laboratory measurements and other secondary outcomes will be compared with the paired Wilcoxon test. Unless otherwise indicated, all statistical tests will be interpreted at a nominal (i.e. no multiplicity adjustment) two-tailed significance level of 0.05 and all CIs at a nominal two-tailed 95% level. The safety and exploratory efficacy outcomes results will be used for analyses.
        The Intention-To-Treat (ITT) and Per Protocol (PP) population will assess all safety and exploratory efficacy endpoints. The ITT population consists of all randomized participants who received the subdermal implant. The PP population includes only participants who complete all research procedures and do not present significant protocol violations, including breach of inclusion criteria.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      Pelvic pain is of multifactorial origin, in which endometriosis is the leading cause. It is challenging to treat endometriosis and there are surgical and hormonal treatments available with variable endpoints. Post-surgery recurrence rate of painful symptoms is high and alternative hormonal methods are needed. Gestrinone is one of the clinical options to reduce endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, but data from clinical controlled trials, particularly with subcutaneous pellets, are scarce.
      This will be the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the safety of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet versus placebo in women with endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response. This is the first to thoroughly evaluate the possible benefits of such a novel gestrinone pharmaceutical formulation with low-dose levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12) and might improve clinical outcomes in this population.
      The study protocol has several innovations such as the participation of a patient representative as member of the Trial Steering Committee. Participant representative provided information about the burden of the disease and the impact of the treatment through a patient perspective that enabled the inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in the study protocol. The trial will use advanced technology for data collection to capture participant′s responses, as well as clinical and biological data. In addition, the study includes a variety of biochemical analyses, including an extension phase that will provide crucial information on the long-term use of gestrinone pellets and PK analyses by LC-MS/MS.
      Since it is a safety-focused study, the trial has an experienced and independent Data Safety Monitoring Board and Clinical Events Classification Committee to evaluate all possible events blindly.
      We acknowledge some limitations of the study. Given the possible 10% dropout rate, the sample size might be small. However, given that it is a safety-focused phase II study, results might serve as a basis for large clinical trials powered enough to conclude the safety and efficacy of gestrinone pellets in patients with pelvic pain due to endometriosis. Another limitation of the GLADE trial was not excluding concomitant adenomyosis at screening. There is a need for future studies to evaluate the efficacy of gestrinone with more precise endometriosis phenotype including concomitant adenomyosis.
      In addition, the target population of GLADE trial is women with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain refractory to surgical treatment, independent of the surgical approach. The potential heterogeneity concerning surgical approaches, preferences and techniques performed at multiple Brazilian centers of expertise in endometriosis will be equilibrated between treatment groups by electronic randomization. Further larger studies addressing the efficacy of subdermal pellet of gestrinone and the potential differences of this effect on anterior, posterior or bowel compartment as well as on adenomyosis would bring evidence of a therapeutic option for pelvic pain.
    
    
      Conclusion
      Gestrinone is used for the treatment of pain in women with endometriosis. Still, there is a lack of data from well-designed randomized clinical trials evaluating such a strategy using a subdermal pellet with a particular focus on safety. We expect the current study will provide high-quality evidence of therapeutic efficacy and foster future studies to further characterize subdermal pellets of gestrinone as a therapeutic option for endometriosis-related pelvic pain.

Title: Limberg’s Rhombic Flap: A Review of Embryological, Anatomical, and Clinical Considerations

Abstract: Nearly a century ago, a new surgical approach was introduced for reconstructing rhombus-shaped defects by designing a highly versatile, geometrical, transpositional local flap, combining rotation and lateral shift. Known as the Limberg flap, this unique design is also known as the rhombic flap or, less precisely, the rhomboid flap. The rhombic flap is a full-thickness flap with a random pattern of blood supply, relying on vascularization from the dermal-subdermal plexus. It offers minimal donor site morbidity, reliable neurovascular supply, and a favorable aesthetic outcome. Over time, rhombic flaps have been widely adopted for the closure of small to medium-sized defects resulting from various clinical conditions across different anatomical regions. Successful implementation of this technique requires, first and foremost, a solid understanding of the embryological and anatomical characteristics of the flap, followed by a detailed overview of the exact technique and its modifications, as well as a step-by-step analysis of each surgical stage. This review aims to present the anatomical principles underlying the rhombic flap, highlight key aspects of its surgical application, including design, technique, contraindications, and complications, and underscore its clinical significance in contemporary reconstructive surgery.

Body: Introduction and background
      The evolution of skin flap surgery closely follows advances in anatomical understanding and surgical planning. A key development was the introduction of the angiosome concept, defining tissue regions extending from skin to bone, supplied by a single artery. Further refinement led to the concept of perforasomes: smaller units each supplied by an individual perforator artery. These units are interconnected by direct and indirect linking vessels, which become functional during flap elevation, allowing perfusion to extend beyond a single perforasome [1]. Translating anatomical theory into operative practice, Professor Alexander Alexandrovich Limberg, a Russian maxillofacial surgeon, introduced a geometric, systemic approach to local flap reconstruction. Limberg designed a transpositional flap for closing 60° and 120° rhombus defects, employing a combination of rotation and lateral shift. Commonly referred to in the literature as the Limberg flap, rhombic flap, or sometimes less accurately, the rhomboid flap, this full-thickness, geometric flap follows the random pattern of blood supply and relies on vascularization from the dermal-subdermal plexus. Its viability is influenced by several factors, including the flap characteristics, such as length-to-width ratio, tissue condition and quality, careful design, and technique, as well as the patient’s medical history. Since its introduction, the rhombic flap has been adopted across various surgical specialties for the reconstruction of small to larger-sized defects in diverse anatomical regions and clinical contexts [2,3]. Due to its geometric clarity, reliable perfusion, and low donor site morbidity, it remains a valuable reconstructive option, particularly in cases where primary closure is not feasible. 
      Historical background
      Dedicating his career to flap design, Limberg introduced the term “opposite triangular flap” for the first time in 1928 [4]. In 1946, he elaborated on this concept, describing its use for closing rhombus-shaped defects [5]. This original Russian monograph was later translated into English as “Design of Local Flaps,” a chapter in Modern Trends in Plastic Surgery, edited by Thomas Gibson [6]. In 1963, Limberg published his major work, The Planning of Local Plastic Operations on the Body Surface: Theory and Practice, which proposed a systemic approach for covering larger defects using adjacent triangular flaps. The English translation of this monograph in 1984 by Wolfe [7] rendered the term “opposite triangular flap” as “convergent triangular flap” [8].
    
    
      Review
      The terminology
      Over the past decade, a linguistic dilemma has emerged in the medical literature concerning the terminology of the Limberg flap as either rhombic or rhomboid. Therefore, it is useful to consider the etymological origin and definition of these two terms. The word “rhombus” derives from the ancient Greek verb “ῥέμβω” (rhémbō), which means to turn around, to spin [9], and it was the name for a child’s spinning top toy [2,10]. In Euclidean plane geometry, a rhombus is an equilateral quadrilateral parallelogram [11], which means that it has four sides, and all the sides have the same length. Ιt has no right angles, and the opposite angles are equal [12]. The adjective “rhombic” describes a noun that has the characteristics and shape of a rhombus. 
      On the other hand, a “rhomboid” in two-dimensional geometry is defined as a parallelogram with oblique angles and uneven adjacent sides. Unlike a rhombus, in a rhomboid, only the opposite sides are the same length [13]. As an adjective, “rhomboid” means having the characteristics and shape like that of a rhombus, or it is rhombus-like [2,10]. The close relationship between the definitions of rhombic and rhomboid has led to their erroneous conflation. Even though rhombic is accepted as the most precise and correct descriptor for the Limberg flap in world literature, rhomboid is still more commonly adopted by the authors. 
      The term “flap” originates from the Dutch word “flappe,” meaning something broad, loose, and suspended, attached by one side only. It refers to a unit of soft tissue being transferred from one site to another while maintaining its own blood supply through a pedicle [14], unlike a tissue graft, which is transferred without its own blood supply [15].
      Embryology and anatomy 
      Embryological Considerations 
      The study of skin development allows for a better understanding of the anatomical features and neurovascular patterns that should be considered during flap design. Embryologically, the skin is composed of two layers: a surface layer, the epidermis, derived from the ectoderm; and a deeper layer, the dermis, derived from the mesenchyme. The epidermis begins to develop from the surface ectoderm following the separation of the neural tube from the overlying ectoderm and the completion of neurulation. By two to three weeks, the ectoderm consists of a single basal layer of cuboidal cells lying atop the underlying mesenchyme, separated by a basement membrane. By four to six weeks, the ectoderm proliferates to form a secondary outer layer of simple squamous, non-keratinizing epithelium, known as the periderm or epitrichium, which serves as the primordium of the epidermis. As the periderm undergoes keratinization, it generates the vernix caseosa, a white waxy substance that protects the forming skin from the amniotic fluid and has an antibacterial effect. By the 11th week, the basal layer progresses into the stratum germinativum, which subsequently, by the 20th week, gives rise to the other four strata of the epidermis: the stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum lucidum (in palms and soles), and stratum corneum [16]. 
      During the second month, mesenchymal cells closest to the ectoderm differentiate into dermal cells. The main component of the dermis is collagen, and depending on its texture, two distinct layers of the dermis can be identified: the papillary layer, which extends upward into the epidermis (epidermal-mesenchymal interactions develop the dermal papillae and the dermal ridges and grooves); and the reticular layer underneath, containing a large amount of collagen fibers. Immediately below the dermis lies the hypodermis, or subcutis, which, over most of the body, is characterized by a thick layer of adipose tissue [16,17]. The development of the dermis also includes the neurovascular supply, which starts within the papillae and is complete by the end of the first trimester of gestation. Thus, by the eighth week, the primitive cells are organized parallel to the epidermis, forming the subpapillary plexus. By seven to 10 weeks, a second deeper horizontal plexus appears, and both plexuses extend to acquire the prenatal vascular pattern of arterioles, venules, and capillaries. Only after the first few postnatal weeks is the definitive adult morphology reached, and the final blood supply of the skin arises from musculocutaneous, direct cutaneous, and septocutaneous arteries [16,18]. 
      Mechanical forces also play a central role in skin morphogenesis. Tension within the tissue directs the alignment of epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts through interactions with extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers and structures such as hair follicles, aligning along axes of mechanical stress, commonly referred to as Langer’s lines. This balance of mechanical forces, known as tensional homeostasis, is essential for maintaining skin structure, fibroblast orientation, collagen fiber organization, and skin contraction [19]. Similarly, during wound healing, fibroblasts interact with the ECM, as collagen fibrils align to generate mechanical tension vectors that guide their migration and differentiation into contractile myofibroblasts. Proper ECM tension supports collagen fiber organization along pre-existing tension lines, thereby facilitating efficient tissue repair. However, excessive tension may lead to hypertrophic scar formation, whereas insufficient tension can impair fibroblast function and collagen production, resulting in suboptimal wound healing outcomes [20]. Understanding the predefined orientation of skin tension lines has direct implications for surgical planning and regenerative outcomes. 
      Anatomical Considerations 
      The microcirculatory system of the skin is composed of several interconnected vascular plexuses. Five distinct plexuses are described within the skin: the dermal and subdermal (often considered a single unit), the subcutaneous, the prefascial, and the fascial networks. The collateral blood flow that occurs in the skin's vascular anatomy enables a significant degree of vascular redundancy. This redundancy ensures adequate nutrient flow into the flap, promoting its survival and healing [18]. The skin is innervated by both the sensory and sympathetic nervous systems. During flap incision, the sympathetic nerves are transected. As a result, catecholamines are released from nerve terminals, while neurotransmitter reuptake is eliminated, leading to local vasoconstriction. This homeostatic mechanism minimizes blood loss, but also reduces critical blood flow within the flap. However, after one or two days, the loss of sympathetic tone induces vasodilation in the network supplying the flap, enhancing its viability. Neovascularization begins on days three to seven, following transfer via angiogenic and vasculogenic processes [16,18,21]. 
      The rhombic flap is a unique, multilayered, local flap due to its geometric transpositional design and random pattern blood supply. This full-thickness flap depends on the dermal-subdermal plexus for vascularization. Structurally, this plexus is found between the hypodermal layer and the reticular layer of the dermis, where numerous arterial anastomoses are present [3]. The preservation of the blood supply and the viability of the flap are influenced by the length-to-width ratio of the pedicle. A length-to-width ratio of 2:1 to 4:1 is generally considered a safe maximum for the head and neck, while a 1:1 ratio should be assessed for areas with insufficient blood supply [21]. Furthermore, the inclusion of a certain amount of subcutaneous fat, which preserves the subdermal plexus in the pedicle, as well as minimal trauma to the pedicle during elevation, will enhance flap viability and lower the risk of necrosis [3]. Although rhombic flaps exhibit a random blood supply, perforator vessels at the base of the flap may need to be identified and preserved in larger defects. Doppler ultrasonography may be used for this purpose [14]. 
      Flap design 
      Original Limberg Flap 
      The Limberg flap was designed for the closure of 60°-120° rhombus defects with a combination of rotation and lateral shift. It represents the transposition of equilateral triangles and can be conceptualized as a variant of the Z-plasty [22]. For a successful flap transfer, especially from areas with relatively lax skin, it is essential to identify and evaluate both the relaxed skin tension lines (RSTLs) and the lines of maximum extensibility (LME) [3]. The RSTLs reflect the natural direction of minimal skin tension in a relaxed state and are more clinically reliable than traditional Langer's lines, which were derived from cadaveric studies. Although in many areas of the body the RSTLs and Langer's lines run in similar directions, in regions with complex movement, such as the corners of the mouth, the temples, the lateral canthal area, and particularly the forehead, they can diverge significantly. Despite their limitations, Langer's lines are still commonly referenced in the literature, often being confused with RSTLs or wrinkle lines, which may lead to clinical misinterpretation [23-25]. 
      The RSTLs are not visible like wrinkle lines, but they can be detected in vivo by gently pinching the skin and observing the direction of the ridges and furrows that form. When pinching is done perpendicular to the RSTLs, the skin produces longer, more uniform furrows that align symmetrically on each side of the pinch. If the pinching is done obliquely, the resulting furrows may form an irregular S-shaped pattern. This technique is considered the most accurate for identifying RSTLs, compared to joint mobilization or muscle contraction, which can lead to misleading lines due to temporary changes in skin tension caused by movement. These temporary changes do not reflect the permanent, natural tension of the RSTLs, which are shaped by the underlying bone, cartilage, and soft tissue. The RSTLs exert a constant tension, even during rest or sleep. The LMEs, on the other hand, lie at a 90° angle to RSTLs and indicate the direction in which the skin can stretch more easily. Recognizing these lines is crucial for reconstructive procedures, as designing flaps in alignment with LMEs can optimize mobility, while incisions placed along RSTLs minimize tension and support better wound healing [21,23,25]. 
      The design begins with the outline of the defect in a rhombus shape. Two parallel lines are drawn along the LME axis, enclosing the defect while maintaining sufficient resection margins. Two additional lines are drawn medially and laterally to form angles of 60° and 120°, resulting in the creation of two possible rhombi. The axis connecting the acute angles (60°) of the rhombus is referred to as the “long axis,” while the axis between the obtuse angles (120°) is referred to as the “short axis” (Figures 1A-1B). The first side of the flap is created by extending the short axis of the rhombus from either side by a distance equal to its own length. The second side of the flap is drawn parallel to the side of the rhombus that is closest to the direction of the second side of the flap, at an angle of 60 degrees, and at the same length as earlier [18]. All sides of both the rhombus and the flap are equal in length. Four flaps can be designed for each geometric rhombus (Figure 2A), although only two are typically feasible in clinical practice [2,3,26]. In these cases, the imaginary line forming this equilateral triangle of the flap should extend along the LME, which is perpendicular to the RSTLs (Figure 2B). This orientation allows the flap to rotate into the primary defect while the secondary defect is closed along the RSTLs [14]. The final result resembles the shape of a “zigzag” line or “question mark” (Figures 2C-2D). The final choice of the flap also considers adjacent anatomical landmarks and the characteristics of aesthetic subunits, including skin thickness, pigmentation, and the presence or absence of hair [2,3,27].

      Modifications 
      In 1962, Claude Dufourmentel modified the Limberg flap design by expanding the acceptable acute angle range of the rhombic defect to 60° to 90° and introducing an alternative flap configuration. The initial incision bisected the angle formed between two imaginary lines: one extending from the short diagonal axis and the other from an adjacent side of the defect. The second incision was aligned parallel to the long diagonal axis. The flap’s sides were equal in length to those of the defect, though not to the short diagonal, and its angle could either match or be smaller than that of the original defect (Figure 3A). Despite the increased geometric complexity, the broader pedicle and more flexible design allowed for improved vascularization, reduced mobilization of healthy tissue, and easier donor site closure [3,28].

          Modifications of the Limberg flap
          A: The Dufourmentel flap (1962) — The initial incision (shown in blue) bisects the angle formed between two imaginary lines (shown in green), one along the short diagonal and one from an adjacent side of the rhombus. A second incision (shown in blue) is made parallel to the long diagonal of the defect. ​
          B: Webster flap (1978) — The 60° base angle of the rhombic defect is divided into two 30° angles using an M-plasty configuration.
          C: Quaba and Sommerland flap (1987) — A circular defect is reconstructed with a rhombic flap whose sides equal two-thirds of the circle's diameter, maintaining a 60° tip angle.​
        
        
      
      In 1978, Richard Webster observed that reducing the apical angles of the flap facilitated more straightforward closure of the resulting secondary defects. Accordingly, he designed a 30° angled flap and divided the 60° angle at the base of the rhombic defect using an M-plasty technique, thereby creating two 30° angles (Figure 3B). This approach resulted in reduced donor site tension and a lower risk of standing cone formation or tissue distortion [29]. 
      In 1987, Quaba and Sommerland replaced the classic rhombic defect with a circular one, which they reconstructed using a smaller rhombic flap. The sides of the flap were equal to two-thirds of the circle’s diameter, while maintaining the 60° angle characteristic of the Limberg flap (Figure 3C). In addition to incorporating the advantages of previous modifications, the Quaba/Sommerland flap preserved healthy tissue by eliminating the need to convert the circular defect into a rhombic shape [30].
      Over the last two decades, different approaches have been published attempting to adjust the classic Limberg flap to various clinical situations, improving its outcomes. Several local Limberg flap modifications have been proposed by Lister and Gibson, and El-Tawil et al., Jervis et al., Karacor-Altuntas et al., and Turan et al., utilizing two [31,32], three [33,34], and four [35] rhombic flaps, respectively, for the closure of larger and more complex defects. Mizutani et al. suggested modified local flaps to minimize the loss of healthy skin during the removal of round tumors in different anatomical regions [36]. More recently, a slightly modified Dufourmental flap has been proposed for a more natural-looking result in skin defect reconstruction [37].
      Surgical application
      Preoperative Considerations
      Assessment of contraindications: Several factors should be assessed preoperatively to determine whether a patient is a potential candidate for the surgical procedure and to detect any reversible factors or contraindications that may increase intraoperative and postoperative complications. Patient factors, including lifestyle, such as nutrition and glucose control, nicotine exposure, and BMI, as well as past medical history and medications, should be documented. Contraindications related to the patient’s health status include uncontrolled diabetes, tobacco use, low BMI (indicating less available skin), vascular diseases, anticoagulation, radiation, and immunosuppressive therapy [14]. However, preoperative lifestyle modifications and medication adjustments may help limit postoperative complications [3]. 
      The characteristics of both the defect and donor site need to be thoroughly examined. The size and location of the defect, the available tissue, and its condition and quality [35], along with RSTLs and vector directions, should be investigated and primary and secondary scars should be properly oriented. Anatomical areas with poor surrounding skin laxity, such as the scalp, forehead, including the glabella, brow, and temporal region, the caudal third of the nose, shoulders, skin over extensor joints, palm of the hand, anterior lower extremity, and lower posterior extremity are generally unfavorable for reconstruction [38,39]. In addition, areas with critical anatomical landmarks, such as the eyes, nostrils, oral commissures, and eyebrows [40], and previously reconstructed sites, should be avoided. Inadequate margin clearance in oncological patients is a contraindication to reconstruction, and the operation should be delayed until negative margins are confirmed [2,3]. While large defects have traditionally been considered a contraindication for rhombic flap reconstruction, successful case reports have demonstrated its feasibility [14]. 
      Intraoperative Considerations
      Technique: The patient is placed in the optimal position for the surgical procedure. After marking the rhombic flap, the appropriate type of anesthesia is administered. Most rhombic flaps can be performed under local or regional anesthesia, though general anesthesia and intravenous sedation may be planned for larger defects, patients with low pain tolerance [2], or those with coexisting factors. When administering local anesthesia, excessive injection of vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, around the vascular pedicle and underneath the flap should be avoided to prevent compromising flap perfusion. Injecting the anesthetic five to 10 minutes before making the incision may improve hemostasis [40]. The area is draped in a standard sterile and antiseptic manner [14]. 
      The lesion is excised with confirmed clear margins, and the excision is extended to form a rhombus-shaped defect. The two limbs of the flap are then incised and raised with the assistance of different surgical tools, such as dissecting scissors, scalpel blades, and skin hooks. During the flap harvest, it is essential to ensure meticulous hemostasis. Bleeding commonly occurs during the initial incision or while undermining the flap, and careful dissection at a uniform plane and the correct depth minimizes blood loss. Adequate hemostasis and hematoma prevention are achieved through the use of bipolar diathermy during the flap harvest. However, aggressive electrocautery should be avoided, as it may damage the dermal and subdermal plexuses crucial for flap perfusion. For optimal aesthetic results, it is important to ensure that the depth of the donor tissue matches the rhombic defect, and that tissue elevation is performed within the same anatomical plane. The donor tissue is rotated into the defect to evaluate tension and any potential deformity [2,3,40]. 
      Closure should start from the donor site, since there is more tension, especially at the apex, and continue with the flap transfer and stabilization into the defect. For safer and more secure coverage, interrupted or mattress sutures, either absorbable or non-absorbable, can be used. When necessary, deep anchor sutures can be placed to offload tension from the superficial layers and maintain proper flap positioning. Throughout the process, gentle tissue handling is crucial to prevent compression of the flap’s corners and blood vessels, ensuring sufficient blood supply [2,3,40]. Eventually, the final scar resembles the shape of a zigzag line [27] or a question mark [2]. 
      Postoperative Considerations 
      Postoperative management involves health monitoring and support, incision care, and early recognition and treatment of adverse effects that may occur following the operation. For this purpose, close hemodynamic monitoring, nutritional support (including strict glucose control), and psychological interventions may be recommended. Antibiotic ointment may be applied along the sutures, which are removed after one to two weeks, depending on the location [14]. 
      Postoperative complications are common, and vigilance for early signs of infection, internal hemorrhage or wound bleeding, pain, and abnormal scarring is required. Flap-related complications, particularly those involving viability, are usually uncommon. Partial or complete flap necrosis has a high incidence among patients with predisposing or contraindicating factors. Flap failure may be prevented through gentle tissue handling and avoidance of intraoperative traumatic techniques. Additionally, excessive traumatic techniques increase the risk of damaging the underlying structure and its components. Aesthetic deformities, such as standing cones ('dog-ear') formation, pincushioning and widened scars, may develop due to tension distribution issues, impaired lymphatic drainage [3], transposition approach, and special anatomic features, such as location, skin elasticity, or thickness [41]. Different aesthetic treatments, like fillers, chemotherapy, laser, and scar modifiers [2], combined with careful preoperative planning and experienced intraoperative technique, may result in a favorable cosmetic outcome [41,42]. It is necessary for patients to be thoroughly informed about all possible complications before consenting to the operation. 
      Clinical significance 
      The rhombic flap is a simple and effective local flap that provides good cosmetic outcomes. It is designed instantly without the need for special considerations. Thanks to its unique geometry, the flap minimizes donor site morbidity and ensures a reliable neurovascular supply. Given that the neighboring skin is mobilized for the closure of the defect following Gillies’ “like for like” principles, it results in an excellent match of skin color, texture and thickness enhancing patient satisfaction [12,14]. 
      A century after it was first introduced by A. A. Limberg, the rhombic flap has been adapted and modified by multiple surgical specialties in a variety of defective locations with different etiologies and sizes, across all demographics, including various age groups, genders, and ethnicities. Rhombic flaps are primarily applied in the head and neck region for facial, central midface, nasal, infraorbital, chin and earlobe defects, dorsally for lumbosacral defects and in the inguinoscrotal and perianal regions. There are also reports of successful use in thoracic, upper and lower limb reconstructions [43-48]. Rhombic flaps have been employed to repair defects caused by skin cancer, lupus, cystic acne, myelomeningoceles, pilonidal sinuses, pressure ulcers, burns, breast cancer, hidradenitis, and life-threatening situations [42-53]. They are particularly indicated for small to medium-sized defects not amenable to primary closure. While traditionally not recommended for larger-sized defects, recent studies have demonstrated the successful application of rhombic flap in excessively large defects [54,55].
    
    
      Conclusions
      The rhombic flap is a highly versatile and effective reconstructive option, applicable in various anatomical regions and clinical contexts. Successful reconstruction using rhombic flaps requires a solid understanding of skin embryogenesis, cutaneous vascular anatomy, neurovascular supply of the integumentary tissues, and tissue geometry. Meticulous planning and thorough evaluation at every stage of the operation are essential to maximize flap viability and aesthetic outcomes. Preoperative evaluation should always include the examination of the patient and the defect, estimating relative contraindications, and precise surgical planning. During flap transfer, the depth of the tissues, the corners, and the blood vessels should be handled delicately and without force. Postoperative care is crucial to prevent associated complications and adverse effects. The recognition of the unique architecture of the flap and the precise application of surgical principles make the rhombic flap readily applicable in various clinical scenarios, ensuring a successful outcome and an excellent aesthetic result.

Title: Clinical Efficacy of a Novel Topical Formulation on Periorbital Dark Circles: An Objective Analysis

Abstract: ABSTRACTBackgroundHyperpigmentation and periorbital dark circles remain challenging dermatological concerns due to their multifactorial etiology, including vascular, pigmentary, and structural components. This study evaluates the efficacy of a novel multi‐action topical formulation designed to target hyperpigmentation and skin aging through a synergistic blend of active ingredients.ObjectiveTo assess the objective and clinical effects of a dermatological composition containing niacinamide, arbutin, tranexamic acid, ubiquinone, a DHEA‐like component, curcuma oily extract, and marine exopolysaccharides on periorbital hyperpigmentation and skin quality.MethodsSubjects with visible under‐eye dark circles applied the formulation twice daily over a treatment period of 6 weeks. The evaluation included instrumental quantitative assessments of skin pigmentation along with standardized imaging. A separate safety study and cosmetic efficacy questionnaire of patient experience were completed.ResultsThe formulation demonstrated statistically significant improvements in pigmentation intensity. The twice daily use of the under‐eye serum resulted in an average overall reduction in under‐eye hyperpigmentation of 47.94%, with no adverse effects observed.ConclusionThis novel topical composition offers a safe and effective multi‐targeted approach for improving periorbital hyperpigmentation and promoting overall skin rejuvenation. The synergistic action of its active components supports its use in clinical and aesthetic dermatology for the treatment of dark circles and age‐related changes.

Body: 1
      Introduction
      Dark circles (periorbital hyperchromia) of the lower eyelid are an increasingly prevalent cosmetic concern in patients presenting to the cosmetic dermatology clinic. Evidence suggests that hyperpigmentation of the eyelids is caused by aging changes, melanisation of the dermis and/or congested blood flow in the periorbital area [1, 2].
      Delicate undereye skin is susceptible to environmental stresses that increase oxidative stress by free radicals such as UV exposure, smoking, and air pollution that result in damage to cellular and extracellular components. Moreover, environmental stresses may deplete the moisture of the skin, exacerbating the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, combined with decreasing collagen and hyaluronic acid concentrations in the skin over the years. It is easy to see why older patients may suffer from dark circles.
      Free radicals that can damage DNA, alter the cytoskeleton, and trigger the release of inflammatory mediators can be neutralized in the body by antioxidants. Natural antioxidants in the body include enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase; while known non‐enzymatic antioxidants that may assist the skin in scavenging UV‐induced free radicals include vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E [3]. Melanin, produced by melanocytes upon exposure to UV rays, can act as an antioxidant but also causes the skin to appear darker. In some cases, this darkening is uneven and results in irregular hyperpigmentation. This is particularly true in older patients whereby melanocyte distribution becomes less regulated by the body. Hyperpigmentation is also a feature of systemic illnesses including Addison's, Cushing's, and coeliac diseases. It can also result secondary to infections (tinea) or exposure to chemicals such as salicylic acid, bleomycin, and cisplatin.
      Hyperpigmentation treatments center around topical agents to support hypopigmentation of the problem area and adjuncts to improve localized blood flow. These treatments primarily target tyrosinase but fail to offset the offending triggers or minimize other signs of aging by reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a novel blend of topical actives on dark circles of the lower eyelid using quantitative image analysis.
      A multi‐action dermatological composition has been developed that acts as an anti‐aging brightening complex that imparts a lightening, antioxidizing, and lifting effect when applied topically to the skin. The complex comprises niacinamide, arbutin, tranexamic acid, ubiquinone, ascorbyl glucoside, a DHEA‐like component, curcuma oily extract, and marine exopolysaccharides.
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a novel blend of topical actives on dark circles of the lower eyelid using quantitative image analysis. We found that blends of topical actives significantly improve the appearance of dark circles within 6 weeks of use.

      Methods
      
        2.1
        Study Design
        This was an open‐label, single‐arm, prospective study carried out in accordance with the principles of the declaration of Helsinki, International Conference on Harmonization Good clinical practice (ICH‐GCP). Recruited patients had baseline facial imaging completed and repeat imaging at a 6‐week endpoint. Within this time period, patients would apply the novel eye serum to their under‐eye areas. All subjects were supplied with a topical eye serum containing a number of active ingredients that include: Niacinamide, natural arbutin, curcuma oily extract, DHEA derivatives, Co‐enzyme Q10, and tranexaminc acid (Table 1). Subjects were instructed to apply the serum to their under‐eye areas twice a day for a period of 6 weeks.

                Tranexamic acid
                Inhibits UV‐induced melanin synthesis by blocking the interaction between keratinocytes and melanocytes and ensures that long term accumulative results are not compromised by UV exposure
              
            
          
        
        They were allowed to engage with their usual face cleansing products but were not to apply any products to their under‐eye area. At the endpoint, a comparative quantitative analysis between baseline and endpoint metrics was completed. A second, separate clinical trial investigating product safety for our serum was completed by Ocealys Laboratoire, Plouzané, France, on 20 female volunteers using a twice daily application for 6 weeks as described above. All 20 subjects completed the 6‐week study and were assessed by a dermatologist and an ophthalmologist. These patients also completed a cosmetic efficacy questionnaire surrounding their subjective experience of the serum.
      
      
        2.2
        Patient Selection
        Recruited patients were adults with concerns regarding the appearance of under‐eye dark circles. Subjects who had not participated in similar investigations and who were willing to agree to the study protocol were included. Subjects with active dermatological or ophthalmological disease, including blepharitis, were excluded. Patients identified to be allergic to any formulation ingredients, pregnant, or breast feeding were also excluded.
        In total, 53 subjects with dark circles of the lower eyelids were recruited for the study and informed consent was obtained. Patients had their Fitzpatrick skin types determined and found to have Type 1 9%, Type 2 26%, Type 3 15%, Type 4 13%, Type 5 26%, and Type 6 9%, illustrating a fair distribution of skin types in the study. The second safety study of 20 female volunteers also had a varied range of skin types 1–4.
      
      
        2.3
        Image Acquisition
        Photographs were taken on the Aram Huvis API 100 camera (Aram Huvis Co. LTD., Gyeonggi‐do, South Korea) of the infraorbital area of both the right and left eyes of each patient at week 0 and week 6. This digital skin analysis camera is equipped with a high‐resolution complementary metal‐oxide‐semiconductor (CMOS) sensor that captures detailed images of the skin for visual assessment rather than direct quantitative color measurement. This is achieved using a specialized light source and CMOS sensor to capture high‐resolution images. An analysis algorithm is used to quantify erythema and skin sensitivity. Quantitative results allow the practitioner to monitor for changes over time and assess the impact of any applied treatments.
        Using the Aram Huvis scoring system, the melanin concentration was measured on the darkness and width of melanin in the infraorbital area. The percentage reduction in hyperpigmentation from week 0 to week 6 was then determined. All measurements were taken under controlled conditions, as a fixed point on the lower lid to prevent any variations in the analysis of the images. The values represent the amount of melanin in the infraorbital area, with lower numbers representing lower levels of melanin and pigmentation, whereas higher numbers represent higher levels of melanin and pigmentation.
      
      
        2.4
        Statistical Analysis
        Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (Version 5.0) (GraphPad Software, CA, USA) software. All data are expressed as means ± standard error with overlying data points. One‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used with a Bonferroni test to compare between groups. A probability value of 95% (p < 0.05) was used to determine significance.

      Results
      
        3.1
        No Adverse Events Reported by Participants
        Of the 53 participants, no subjects reported any adverse effects such as skin irritation, allergic reaction, or ocular irritation over the 6‐week study period. In the second safety study completed by Ocealys Laboratoire, Plouzané, France, all subjects completed the 6‐week study, and there were also no adverse events reported. The results of the cosmetic efficacy questionnaire confirmed the dermatological composition provides skin brightening, lightening, lifting, and smoothing effects when applied to the eye area of the user (Table 2).

        The results demonstrate that an eye serum containing a blend of naturally derived and synthetic extracts of the novel blend achieved global skin rejuvenation by significantly improving the appearance of periorbital hyperpigmentation.

        Aram Huvis Analysis Illustrating Changes Observed in Patient's Skin Upon Topical Treatment After 6 Weeks
        Using the inbuilt analysis algorithm, it was possible evaluate patient skin metrics including sensitivity, pore appearance, wrinkles, acne, and melanin. These metrics are graded on a three‐point scales: Good, Care needed, Intensive care. Included are the representative outputs for two sample patients of the cohort. Both are females in their 30's.
        The first patient was graded ‘intensive care’ on four of the five metrics. After 6 weeks topical treatment with this eye serum, all metrics showed improved with three of the four outputs now graded as ‘good’ (Figure 4). The second patient at week 0 had three areas graded as ‘intensive care’ and one as ‘care needed’. At week 6 she was found to have a grading of ‘good’ in all metrics (Figure 5).

      Discussion
      This study introduces a novel serum that can significantly reduce the appearance of periocular pigmentation. Commonly referred to as ‘dark circles’, these represent a significant aesthetic concern for many individuals. Whilst the etiology is incompletely understood, a multi‐factor cause is postulated that encompasses intrinsic and external factors. Commonly cited causes include excessive pigmentation, vascular perfusion and lifestyle factors including stress and sleep deprivation [4, 5].
      The treatment options for dark circles are diverse, reflecting the multifactorial nature of the condition [6]. Non‐surgical options are frequently employed, and many aim to reduce melanin pigment production and stimulate blood flow around the periorbital area [7]. Treatments include topical agents, injectable fillers, and various laser therapies. Dermal fillers can restore volume to thin skin, whilst lasers target pigmentation and vascularity [8]. Newer modalities include the injection of platelet rich plasma (PRP) to rejuvenate a patient's skin with their serum factors [9, 10]. Surgical interventions, such as lower blepharoplasty, are considered for more severe cases where structural issues contribute significantly to the appearance of dark circles. This procedure can reposition or remove excess fat and skin, addressing both shadowing and volume loss. Limitations of these modalities include both cost and what is acceptable to the patient. There is therefore a clinical need to develop an acceptable, efficacious, and cost‐effective method of addressing dark circles.
      Excessive pigmentation of the eyelids may be attributed to melanin and hemoglobin, which are the primary chromophores in the skin, and their presence can result in changes in skin color. Melanin is produced by melanocytes, and the differences in pigmentation in skin are due to the ratio of eumelanin (brown‐black) to pheomelanin (yellow‐red), as well as the number of melanosomes within the melanocytes. Studies carried out on Fitzpatrick skin types I–III have shown that those with a higher skin type have an increased eumelanin content, compared to those of a lower skin type [11]. Hemoglobin is the dominant protein constituent of red blood cells, which has a primary role of transporting oxygen throughout the body. Oxygenated hemoglobin produces a pink tint in lightly pigmented skin, whereas deoxygenated hemoglobin produces a blue tint in lightly pigmented skin. Thin periocular skin, combined with underlying vascularity, results in shadowing and exacerbates the appearance of dark circles. Moreover, evidence suggests that dark circles appear in areas of the skin where there is congestion or stasis of blood flow [12]. Topical treatments that can modulate the production of melanin and vascularity are therefore a source of interest in managing those patients where hyperpigmentation and vascular shadowing are the main sources of their dark circles.
      Topical agents traditionally employed to reduce dark circles include bleaching agents such as hydroquinone and chemical peels using trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and glycolic acid. These agents can target melanin accumulation, but their effectiveness can be inconsistent and are often accompanied by adverse effects, limiting their desirability as treatment options. In contrast, less invasive treatments, like hyaluronic acid fillers, can improve the aesthetic appearance by restoring volume lost due to thinning skin and dehydration. Their use is limited by their temporary duration, requiring minimally invasive injections and associated risks, including loss of vision. There is a need, therefore, for safe and effective topical agents to reduce the appearance of dark circles. Research into topical treatments that include ingredients such as vitamin C, peptides, and botanical extracts has shown potential in enhancing skin quality and reducing dark circles [13]. These data add to the growing body of literature that supports the use of topical agents in managing the appearance of dark circles. Importantly, the serum described within achieves a significant reduction in objective pigmentation whilst also achieving patient satisfaction with only 6 weeks of application.
      A number of effective agents have been investigated to date. Ertam et al. in 2008 found that treatment with a 1% arbutin gel significantly reduced pigmentation by 43.5% compared with 7.1% in the placebo group [14]. Hakozaki et al. 2002 determined that a 5% niacinamide cream, when applied for 4 weeks, significantly reduced the pigmented spots by 11% [15]. Studies have further identified novel formulations that incorporate botanical extracts and other bioactive compounds that are aimed at enhancing under‐eye skin health, and combination products containing a blend of actives are reported to be better than single active‐containing products [16]. Both of these agents are included in our eye serum formulation and act synergistically to both reduce melanin production and transport.
      There have been numerous formulations of active agents developed with contrasting results. A recent study by Rajabi‐Estarabadi et al., 2023 investigated the application of a topical formulation with tetrahexyldecyl (THD) ascorbate (vitamin C), caffeine, bioactive peptides, and botanical extracts. They reported a reduction in the appearance of dark circles of 12.5% at 4 weeks and 20% after 12 weeks of treatment [17]. Similar results were achieved by Ahmadraji and Shatalebi, 2015, who achieved a 16% response rate in the reduction of dark circles using a counter pad containing caffeine and vitamin K in an emulsified Emu oil base after 28 days [18]. Another study utilizing a serum containing tyrostat, aldavine, and lanachrys 2B achieved a mean reduction in colorimetric melanin values of 12.29% after 3 months use [19]. In comparison, our serum used twice daily resulted in an average objective reduction in under‐eye hyperpigmentation of 47.94%. Our serum builds upon the positive findings of topical arbutin and niacinamide, combined with other active ingredients with varying mechanisms of action to achieve this result. Importantly, the second separate clinical trial investigating product safety for our serum, completed by Ocealys Laboratoire, Plouzané, France, on 20 female volunteers, reported no adverse effects after examination by a dermatologist and ophthalmologist. The results of the cosmetic efficacy questionnaire confirmed the dermatological composition provides skin brightening, lightening, lifting, and smoothing effects when applied to the eye area of the user.
      For patients with particularly dark circles, or with multifactorial etiologies, a combination of therapeutic strategies is often recommended. A systematic review has confirmed the effectiveness of combining topical agents with procedural modalities, such as laser treatments and fillers. This holistic approach ensures that both pigmentary and structural concerns are addressed [20].
      A limitation of this study is the limited timeframe of 6 weeks. Whilst achieving the study objective within this timeframe, it would be interesting to complete longer term follow‐up as to the duration of effect. It would also be of interest in combining this treatment with surgical approaches to assess for any synergistic effect upon the appearance of dark circles. Another limitation of this study was the unblinded nature to both parties. The introduction of bias was reduced in this study; however, by relying on objective measurements rather than subjective response scales. A study using a placebo, comparator, or internal control where the subject would apply the serum to one side was considered. It was thought that there may be challenges in patient compliance with this approach, as the patient, with aesthetic concerns, may wish to apply the serum to the control side to avoid asymmetry as the serum takes effect, resulting in reduced pigmentation on the treatment side arm of the study.

      Conclusion
      This study introduces a novel under‐eye serum for the treatment of dark circles. The most important finding was a statistically significant reduction in pigmentation as demonstrated by objective analysis. Importantly, no adverse events were recorded, and all patients reported positive experiences with use of the serum.

Title: Novel melasma therapy using combined low fluence and microsecond pulse Q switched 1064 nm neodymium doped yttrium aluminium garnet laser

Abstract: Low-fluence Q-switched (LFQS) 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser treatment has become a standard approach for managing melasma. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a dual-mode approach—LFQS combined with microsecond pulse width (MPW) mode—for treating melasma. In this prospective, single-center, evaluator-blinded, split-face clinical trial, 28 patients with melasma were enrolled. One half of each face was treated using LFQS alone, whereas the other half received LFQS + MPW. Follow-ups were conducted at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment. Of the 28 patients, 21 completed all treatments and follow-ups (5–10 sessions in total). Compared with baseline, the average Melasma Area and Severity Index score significantly decreased at 1 and 3 months. However, no significant change was observed at 6 and 12 months. The melanin index (MI) decreased significantly on both sides at 1 and 6 months, with the treatment side maintaining a significantly lower MI at 12 months. Although MI increased at 6 and 12 months, the increase was significantly less on the treatment side compared with the control side. VISIA analysis showed a significant bilateral reduction in facial pigmentation index at 1, 6, and 12 months, although the difference between sides was not statistically significant. However, the treatment side showed a significantly greater reduction in red area index at 1 and 6 months. No treatment-related adverse events were reported. The combination of low-fluence and MPW modes of Q-switched 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser is a safe and effective treatment for melasma. This dual-mode approach may help reduce relapse rates within 3 months after treatment discontinuation.

Body: Introduction
      Melasma is an acquired pigmentary disorder with a prevalence ranging from 8.8 to 40% across different ethnic groups, with particularly high rates observed in Asian populations1. As a common dermatological condition, melasma not only affects physical appearance but also contributes to psychological distress and can negatively impact work and social interactions. Despite its prevalence, the precise pathogenesis of melasma remains incompletely understood. Current evidence suggests several contributing mechanisms, including the biological activation of melanocytes, accumulation of melanin and melanosomes in the epidermis and dermis, increased mast cell numbers, photo-induced elastic fiber damage, alterations in the basement membrane, and enhanced vascularization2–7. First-line treatments for melasma typically include topical agents such as hydroquinone, chemical peels, and oral medications like tranexamic acid. However, these therapies often exhibit variable efficacy among individuals and are associated with high relapse rates8.
      In recent years, various energy-based devices—including lasers, intense pulsed light, and radiofrequency devices—have been increasingly applied in the treatment of melasma, demonstrating both safety and efficacy. Among these, laser therapy, a relatively novel approach, operates on the principle of selective photothermolysis. It targets and fragments pigment particles within melanocytes with minimal damage to surrounding normal tissues, offering rapid therapeutic effects. The use of low-fluence Q-switched (LFQS) 1064-nm Nd: YAG (LFQSNY) laser has progressively become a standard treatment modality for melasma9. This approach, commonly referred to as “laser toning,” involves the use of large spot sizes, low fluences, and multiple passes, typically administered over 5–10 sessions at weekly to monthly intervals. The mechanism underlying this technique is known as “subcellular-selective photothermolysis”10,11. However, most existing studies on LFQS laser treatment involve short-term follow-up and lack robust control conditions. Moreover, given the multifactorial pathogenesis of melasma, targeting a single pathological mechanism is unlikely to yield long-term and stable therapeutic outcomes. A previous study demonstrated that combining multiple modes of 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser treatment resulted in higher melasma clearance rates and lower relapse rates after 1 year of follow-up12. LFQS mode has been extensively studied and supported by a substantial body of evidence13; however, the additional modes employed in combination therapy, although theoretically promising, remain under-investigated. The microsecond pulse width (MPW) 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser, for instance, has shown efficacy in the treatment of acne and facial rejuvenation, with notable improvements in inflammation control, erythema reduction, and skin texture. Histopathological examinations have revealed increased collagen deposition in the papillary dermis following MPW laser treatment, suggesting that this pulse width induces thermal injury to small blood vessels and promotes collagen remodeling by targeting hemoglobin14,15.
      Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate whether combining LFQS and MPW modes of a 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser enhances treatment efficacy, reduces melasma relapse rates, and maintains safety in a prospective clinical trial.

        Study design
        This prospective, single-center, evaluator-blinded clinical trial was conducted from June 2021 to October 2023 and included 28 Chinese patients diagnosed with melasma. Inclusion criteria were (1) patients aged 18–60 years, regardless of sex; (2) no history of prior melasma treatments such as oral tranexamic acid, topical hydroquinone, laser therapy, or mesotherapy; (3) willingness to participate in a split-face controlled trial and comply with follow-up visits; and (4) provision of written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were (1) pregnancy or lactation; (2) history of photosensitivity; (3) presence of active skin diseases in the treatment area; (4) wounds, infections, or ulcers at the treatment site; and (5) any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigators, could interfere with the study outcomes.
        This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ninth People’s Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. The clinical trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2100049271) on July 28, 2021. All patients were informed of the treatment plan and potential risks. And written informed consent for both study participation and publication of identifying information/images in an online open-access publication was obtained from each participant. We confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulationst.
      
      
        Intervention
        Patients were randomly assigned to left or right facial treatment groups using the sealed envelope randomization method. No topical anesthesia was applied before treatment. Laser procedures were performed using the Fotona QX MAX® device (Fotona, Slovenia), equipped with a Q-switched laser (wavelength: 1064/532 nm; pulse width: 5–20 ns; frequency: 0.5–10 Hz) and a MPW mode (wavelength: 1064 nm; pulse width: 250 µs; frequency: 0.5–2.2 Hz).
        The control side (half of the patient’s face) was treated using only the LFQS mode with a spot size of 6–8 mm and fluence of 1.4–3.0 J/cm2, adjusted based on the clinical endpoint of mild erythema in the lesion area. Approximately 1000–1200 shots were delivered. The treatment side (the other half of the face) received dual-mode therapy: the same LFQS parameters as the control side, combined with the MPW mode using a full-spot handpiece (6–8 mm, 2.2 Hz) and fluence of 10–15 J/cm2, also adjusted to achieve mild erythema as the treatment endpoint.
        All treatments were administered by a single, non-evaluating investigator. Throughout the 1-year follow-up period, no cold compresses were applied, and no additional treatments or specialized topical skincare products for melasma were used. Strict sun protection was required for 1 month following the final treatment session. Patients were also instructed to avoid the use of tranexamic acid (topical or oral) and to refrain from undergoing any other form of phototherapy during the entire study period. Treatments were performed at 1-month intervals. The total number of treatment sessions was determined based on either the patient’s subjective evaluation or the treating physician’s assessment. Treatment was discontinued and follow-up was initiated when the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) score reached ≤ 2 or the Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score was reduced by ≥ 50%.
      
      
        Photographic documentation
        Standardized clinical photographs were taken by the same photographer using a professional digital camera (Canon 60D DSLR body with EF 50 mm f/1.2 USM portrait lens, Canon, Japan). Consistent lighting conditions, camera settings, and patient positioning were maintained throughout. Photographs were captured from three angles: frontal, 45° left, and 45° right. Additionally, digital images were obtained using the VISIA-CR imaging system (Canfield Scientific, Parsippany, NJ, USA) for objective analysis. The pigment index and red area index were used to assess the percentage of facial features that were better than the normative data for the same age group; higher values indicated fewer pigmentation spots and reduced erythema.
        VISIA photographs were taken under standardized lighting conditions using cross-polarized, parallel-polarized, and ultraviolet light at three angles: right lateral (37°), left lateral (37°), and frontal. Both sets of photographs were captured before each treatment session and during follow-up visits at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment.
      
      
        Clinical efficacy and safety evaluation
        The primary outcome was the number of treatment sessions required to reach the predefined treatment endpoint. The treatment endpoint was defined as either a GAIS score of ≤ 2—where 1 = ≥ 75% improvement (very significant), 2 = 50–75% improvement (significant), 3 = 25–50% improvement (moderate), 4 = < 25% improvement (mild), and 5 = no improvement—or a ≥ 50% reduction in the MASI score. Secondary outcomes included the VISIA pigment index and melanin index (MI), assessed using the Skintel™ Melanin Reader™ (Palomar Cynosure, Burlington, MA, USA). Pain levels during treatment were evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain).
        Relapse was defined as an increase in the MASI score16. All adverse reactions occurring before and after each laser treatment were recorded, including potential side effects such as post-treatment erythema, edema, bleeding, itching, blistering, scabbing, hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, infection, and scarring. The severity of each adverse event was assessed using a 4-point scale: 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe). The overall frequency and average severity score were then calculated for each type of side effect.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation or median, as appropriate, whereas categorical variables are expressed as frequencies or percentages. Paired t-tests were used for normally distributed continuous data, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied for non-parametric data to compare pre- and post-treatment values. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

        Patient demographics and clinical outcomes
        Of the 28 patients enrolled, 21 completed the full course of treatment and follow-up assessments, with some loss to follow-up attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among the 21 patients, 3 were male (14.3%) and 18 were female (85.7%), with a mean age of 38.7 ± 5.2 years. Based on Fitzpatrick skin type classification, 8 patients (38.1%) had type III, whereas 13 (61.9%) had type IV or V. Each patient received between 5 and 10 treatment sessions. Figure 1 presents representative clinical cases. Table 1 summarizes GAIS scores, patient-reported improvements by treatment side, and relapse rates at all follow-up time points. Patient-reported efficacy declined over time: the proportion of patients with a GAIS score of ≥ 2 decreased from 81.0% at 1 month post-treatment to 52.4% at 12 months. Nevertheless, the treatment side consistently demonstrated superior outcomes. Even at 12 months post-treatment, 14.3% of patients continued to report better improvement on the treatment side than on the control side. Patient self-assessments indicated varying degrees of melasma relapse beginning 3 months after the final treatment. At this time point, the relapse rate was significantly lower on the treatment side than on the control side (4.8% vs. 23.8%, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.047). Although relapse rates increased at 6 and 12 months post-treatment, the differences between the two sides were no longer statistically significant. Figure 2 shows representative images of patients who experienced relapse.

After eight treatment sessions and at the 1-month follow-up, the GAIS score was 2 (much improved), with better outcomes observed on the LFQS + MPW side. At the 6-month follow-up, the GAIS score was 3, indicating moderate improvement, with evidence of relapse on the LFQS side (MASI: 7.2; MI: 24 on both sides). By 12 months post-treatment, the GAIS score remained at 3, with bilateral relapse observed, more pronounced on the LFQS side. At this time, the MASI score was 9.9, and the MI score was 26 on both sides.

      
      
        VISIA analysis
        Quantitative analysis of facial digital images was conducted using VISIA imaging (representative cases shown in Fig. 3) before treatment and at follow-up visits. A significant improvement in the bilateral facial pigmentation index was observed at 1, 6, and 12 months post-treatment compared with baseline (paired t-test, p < 0.001). However, the degree of improvement declined at 6 and 12 months relative to the 1-month follow-up, though this reduction was not statistically significant (paired t-test, p > 0.05). Additionally, no statistically significant difference was found between the treatment and control sides at any follow-up time point (paired t-test, p > 0.05).

The right side was treated with LFQS (8 mm, 1.5–1.6 J/cm2) + MPW mode (8 mm, 10 J/cm2), and the left side with LFQS alone (8 mm, 1.5–1.6 J/cm2). (A,B) vs. (G,H) show baseline and 1-month post-treatment images of bilateral melisma under 37° white light, with visible improvement on both sides. Figures (C,D) vs. (I,J) depict pigmented spots under 37° ultraviolet light. At baseline, the pigmentation score was 60% on both sides; at 1 month post-treatment, the score improved to 77% on the LFQS side and 80% on the LFQS + MPW side, indicating bilateral improvement. Figures (E) and (F) vs. (K) and (L) show the red area index before and after treatment. At baseline, both sides scored 40%; at 1 month post-treatment, the LFQS side remained unchanged at 40%, whereas the LFQS + MPW side increased to 57%, suggesting a marked reduction in vascularity on the treatment side.

        No significant change in the red area index was observed on the control side at any time point following treatment compared with baseline (p > 0.999). In contrast, the treatment side demonstrated a significant improvement in the red area index at both 1 and 6 months post-treatment (p < 0.001), with values also significantly better than those of the control side at the same time points (1 month: p < 0.0001; 6 months: p = 0.0014). However, by 12 months post-treatment, the red area index on the treatment side showed no statistically significant difference compared with either baseline (p = 0.1307) or the control side (p = 0.3675) (Fig. 4).

        MASI and MI
        The average MASI score showed a significant decrease at 1 and 3 months post-treatment compared with baseline (p = 0.043). However, no statistically significant difference was observed at 6 and 12 months relative to baseline (p > 0.05). When compared with the MASI score at 1 month post-treatment, scores at 3, 6, and 12 months exhibited an upward trend, although the increases were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). MI scores demonstrated a significant reduction at 1 and 6 months on both the treatment and control sides (p < 0.05), and the treatment side also maintained a significantly lower MI at 12 months (p < 0.05). Although an increasing trend in MI scores was observed at 6 and 12 months, these changes were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Notably, the degree of MI increase on the treatment side was significantly lower than that on the control side (p = 0.004) (Fig. 5).

        Safety evaluation
        The average VAS pain score was 3.2 on the treatment side and 3.0 on the control side, with no statistically significant difference between the two. No treatment-related adverse events were reported throughout the study, including edema, bleeding, blistering, scabbing, hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, infection, or scarring.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that dual-mode laser therapy—targeting both pigment and vascular components of melasma—is safe and more effective across multiple clinical parameters compared with single-mode treatment targeting only pigmentation. Moreover, the dual-mode approach was associated with a lower short-term relapse rate during the 1-year follow-up period. However, in the long term, the relapse rate did not differ significantly from that observed with the single LFQS mode.
      In this study, subjective evaluations based on GAIS scores indicated that all patients experienced varying degrees of improvement, whether treated with LFQS mode alone or in combination with MPW mode. Although oral tranexamic acid and topical hydroquinone are commonly recommended as first-line therapies for melasma, patient compliance is often poor. This is primarily due to contraindications such as a history of smoking, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, or hereditary thrombophilia as well as the extended duration of treatment typically required (> 6 months)10,17.
      Since 2000, LFQSNY laser therapy has gradually become the gold standard for treating melasma in Asian patients, providing a relatively safe depigmentation effect through repeated sessions18. Compared with normal skin, melasma lesions exhibit elevated activity of melanin and increased expression of melanogenesis-associated proteins, including melanocyte-stimulating hormone, tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related proteins (TRP-1 and TRP-2), nerve growth factor, and stem cell factor. LFQSNY laser exerts a subcellular-level selective photothermal effect, which has been shown to significantly reduce the number of melanosomes and suppress the expression of melanogenesis-related proteins, while leaving the number of melanocytes unchanged11. However, inappropriate treatment parameters or poorly designed treatment protocols can still result in adverse effects, such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation18,19.
      Few studies have explored the long-term efficacy of LFQSNY laser treatment, and unfortunately, the relapse rate following treatment discontinuation remains high—reportedly as much as 58.8% at approximately 1 year post-treatment20. This finding is consistent with our study results. In our trial, the dual-mode approach combining LFQS and MPW achieved a higher relapse-free rate and prolonged relapse-free duration compared with LFQS alone. However, due to the clinical observational nature of this study, we were unable to directly investigate the underlying mechanisms. Given that the pathogenesis of melasma involves multiple factors, such as abnormal melanocyte function, photoaging, and vascular abnormalities2–7, we hypothesize that the combination of two laser modes may yield synergistic effects. Specifically, the LFQS mode is believed to reduce melanocyte activity and target melanin aggregation in the epidermis and dermis through a mechanism known as “subcellular-selective photothermolysis,” which selectively disrupts melanin without damaging melanocytes. In contrast, the MPW mode may contribute to improved outcomes by addressing vascular inflammation and photoaging. It delivers stacked 250-µs pulses that can coagulate superficial blood vessels and provide dermal heating, promoting collagen remodeling and reducing solar elastosis14,15. The ability of the microsecond 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser to induce dermal thickening and improve skin texture may help mask underlying pigmentary lesions. Notably, our study also observed a significant reduction in the red area index on the treatment side, supporting the anti-vascular and anti-inflammatory effects of MPW. A previous study reported that a 300-µs 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser stimulated new collagen formation in the papillary dermis14, and a 2020 study demonstrated successful treatment of moderate to severe acne and scarring using a 650-µs 1064-nm laser combined with isotretinoin, further highlighting the vascular coagulation and anti-inflammatory potential of MPW lasers21. These findings suggest that non-ablative vascular targeting, skin texture improvement, and collagen regeneration may contribute to the therapeutic effect of MPW in melasma management. Based on this evidence, we propose a tailored approach for future treatment: if baseline clinical evaluation or imaging reveals pronounced erythema or elevated red index, the combined LFQS and microsecond 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser strategy should be considered the first-line option.
      Although this study is among the few randomized split-face trials with a follow-up period of up to 1 year, it has certain limitations. First, the sample size was relatively small compared with that in a previous study21, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some patients were unable to undergo objective assessments 3 months after the final treatment, further reducing the number of participants included in the final analysis. Another limitation is the absence of histopathologic classification of melasma. The condition was assessed solely through clinical observation, without distinguishing between different subtypes based on pigment depth or morphological patterns. Given that melasma exhibits heterogeneous features, such as variations in pigment distribution and lesion depth, this lack of histological differentiation may affect the interpretation of treatment responses. It also makes it difficult to assess the specific impact of LFQS and MPW modes on different melasma subtypes and their respective pathophysiologic mechanisms. These limitations highlight the need for future studies to incorporate histopathologic evaluation to better stratify patients, optimize treatment protocols, and more accurately predict clinical outcomes. Furthermore, long-term studies are warranted to evaluate relapse rates following repeated courses of treatment and to identify predictors of sustained remission.
      In conclusion, the combination of LFQS and MPW 1064-nm Nd: YAG laser treatment proved to be a safe, non-invasive approach with no downtime or adverse reactions. This dual-mode therapy appears to enhance treatment efficacy and reduce the short-term relapse rate of melasma. For patients who are unwilling or unable to undergo combination drug therapy, this laser-based strategy may serve as an effective and minimally invasive alternative.

Title: Synergistic Approach: Enhancing Facial Rejuvenation With Combined EndoliftX and Lightscan Therapy



Body: 1
      Introduction
      Facial aging presents a multifactorial challenge involving four principal changes: deterioration of skin texture, increased laxity of soft tissues, development of wrinkles and folds, and volume loss or redistribution [1]. These transformations are primarily driven by intrinsic aging processes, chronic sun exposure, subcutaneous fat atrophy, and environmental factors [2]. In response, modern aesthetic medicine has increasingly adopted noninvasive or minimally invasive procedures such as chemical peels, microneedling, botulinum toxin A, dermal fillers, laser treatments, radiofrequency (RF), and high‐intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)—to address these concerns through skin resurfacing, tissue tightening, rhytid reduction, and volume restoration [1, 3].
      The increasing interest in less‐invasive technologies aligns with patient expectations for safe, efficient interventions with minimal downtime [4]. While fractional ablative lasers like CO2 and erbium:YAG remain highly effective, they are associated with prolonged recovery and higher risks of complications, particularly in patients with darker phototypes or a history of scarring [5]. Non‐ablative options, such as EndoliftX (LASEmaR 1500 by Eufoton, Trieste, Italy) and Lightscan (Lightscan by Eufoton, Trieste, Italy), provide safer alternatives with deeper tissue penetration and lower adverse event rates [6].
      EndoliftX employs a 1470‐nm diode laser delivered via an optical fiber (200–1000 μm diameter), converting optical energy into localized heat that induces subcutaneous adipocyte disruption, immediate contraction of connective septa, tissue compaction, and stimulation of elastic fiber remodeling [7]. This process initiates neocollagenesis, progressively replacing degraded Type I and III collagen and leading to sustained skin tightening and dermal rejuvenation [8, 9]. Clinically, Endolift has demonstrated favorable results in reducing facial wrinkles and folds, enhancing skin firmness in both facial and body areas and achieving contouring outcomes, including nasal remodeling and blepharoptosis correction [10, 11, 12].
      Complementing this, Lightscan utilizes a fractional 1470‐nm non‐ablative coagulation laser absorbed by water in the dermis, to create controlled microthermal zones (~700 μm in depth). These zones enhance skin texture, firmness, and promote skin regeneration [13].

      Materials and Methods
      
        2.1
        Study Design
        This prospective case series was conducted between January and March 2024. The study included three adult patients presenting with clinically evident age‐related hemifacial asymmetry, in which one side of the face showed more advanced signs of skin laxity and ptosis. This study respected the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, ensuring every participant's safety, well‐being, and rights (Ethical Committee protocol no. 0097231/2023). All patients gave informed consent after an exhaustive explanation of the procedure and its potential adverse events (AEs).
      
      
        2.2
        Patient Selection
        A total of three healthy female patients, aged 50–70 years, were included in the study.
        Inclusion criteria were:
Age between 45 and 70 years.Fitzpatrick skin type II–III.Visible facial asymmetry related to aging, with unilateral predominance of soft tissue ptosis.No aesthetic procedures in the previous 6 months.

        Exclusion criteria were:
Active dermatologic diseases (e.g., eczema, acne).History of bleeding disorders.Pregnancy or lactation.Previous treatment with botulinum toxin, dermal fillers, or facial surgery within 6 months.Known keloid tendency or history of connective tissue/autoimmune diseases.

      
      
        2.3
        Operator and Setting
        All procedures were performed by a single board‐certified aesthetic physician with over 10 years of clinical experience in laser‐based facial rejuvenation and body contouring. The operator holds a specialization in aesthetic medicine and has completed advanced training programs in laser technologies.
        The physician has participated in multiple national and international workshops and conferences focused on minimally invasive laser procedures, staying abreast of the latest advancements in the field. This extensive training encompasses both theoretical knowledge and practical application, ensuring adherence to standardized treatment protocols and patient safety guidelines.
        All treatments were conducted in a private dermatologic and aesthetic medicine clinic in Italy, equipped with certified laser devices and adhering to stringent hygiene and safety standards. The clinical setting is compliant with national health regulations and is equipped with facilities for pre‐ and post‐procedure patient care, including standardized lighting and photography setups for consistent documentation.
      
      
        2.4
        Treatment Protocol
        A customized approach was applied, using a combination of EndoliftX and Lightscan on the more affected side and EndoliftX alone on the less affected side (Figure 1).
        
          FIGURE 1
          
            The red arrows illustrate the directional vectors along which the EndoliftX technique is applied, guiding the precise movement and focus of the treatment. In contrast, the green dots mark the specific points where the Lightscan treatment is administered, highlighting the targeted areas for localized application. A combination of EndoliftX and Lightscan was used on the more affected side, and EndoliftX alone was applied on the less aged side.
          
          
        
        For the EndoliftX procedure, a solution comprising 5 mL lidocaine and 15 mL saline was injected into the subcutaneous tissue using a 22 G × 70 mm cannula prior to inserting the 1470‐nm diode laser, equipped with an optical fiber ranging from 400 μm (Eufoton, FTF Linear Fiber). The laser parameters were set to three watts, with a T‐on of 45 and a T‐off of 50, delivering an average of approximately 500 J per treated area.
        Lightscan was added for the combination therapy, applying non‐ablative fractional 1470‐nm laser treatment at four watts, with parameters set at a T‐on of six and a T‐off of 15, delivering 50 mJ per spot.
        Both procedures aimed to address the structural and textural aspects of skin aging, and the combination therapy was applied to the hemiface exhibiting greater signs of aging and skin laxity.

        Clinical and Patient Evaluation
        
          2.5.1
          Photographic Assessment
          Clinical outcomes were documented using standardized digital photographs captured at baseline and 15 days post treatment. Each photographic session included:
Frontal viewRight and left true lateral views (profile)

          Images were acquired under consistent conditions: fixed camera (1.5 m distance), diffuse lighting, neutral background, and with the patient seated upright in a relaxed position, maintaining a neutral facial expression and no application of makeup or skin products. Hair was pulled back to fully expose facial contours. This standardized protocol ensured reproducibility and accuracy in comparative analysis.
        
        
          2.5.2
          Clinician‐Based Evaluation
          Two independent board‐certified clinicians—two dermatologists with 12 years of experience in aesthetic and laser dermatology—evaluated the images. Both were blinded to the treatment allocation for each hemiface. Discrepancies in scoring were resolved by consensus.
          Assessment criteria included:
Degree of skin laxity.Depth and distribution of wrinkles (e.g., forehead lines, nasolabial folds, marionette lines).Degree of hemifacial asymmetry.Contour definition of midface and jawline.Skin texture and surface homogeneity.

          Clinician scoring systems used:
Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS—clinician‐rated): A 5‐point scale used to assess global aesthetic improvement relative to baseline:
○5 = Very much improved○4 = Much improved○3 = Improved○2 = No change○1 = Worse
Lemperle Wrinkle Severity Scale: A 6‐point ordinal scale for wrinkle depth (0–5), applied to nasolabial and marionette lines:
○0 = No wrinkles○1 = Just perceptible wrinkle○2 = Shallow wrinkle○3 = Moderately deep wrinkle○4 = Deep wrinkle with well‐defined edges○5 = Very deep wrinkle with redundant folds


        
        
          2.5.3
          Patient‐Reported Evaluation
          At 15 days follow‐up, each patient completed a structured self‐assessment questionnaire. Evaluation parameters included:
GAIS (patient‐rated): Patients self‐rated the improvement of their facial appearance on the same 5‐point GAIS scale used by clinicians.Treatment Satisfaction (5‐point Likert scale): Patients rated their overall satisfaction with the outcome of the procedure:
○1 = Very dissatisfied○2 = Dissatisfied○3 = Neutral○4 = Satisfied○5 = Very satisfied
Pain assessment (visual analog scale [VAS]): Perceived pain during and after the procedure was scored on a 0–10 VAS, where 0 represents no pain and 10 the maximum imaginable pain.

      Results
      
        3.1
        Case 1
        The first patient, a 50‐year‐old woman, had more pronounced skin laxity and photoaging on the left hemiface. The right side was treated with EndoliftX alone, while the left hemiface received the combination of a EndoliftX and Lightscan. After a 15‐day follow‐up, the left side showed a significantly greater improvement in skin laxity, elasticity, and overall appearance, reducing the asymmetry between the two sides (Figures 2A–D, 3A–D).

        3.2
        Case 2
        A 70‐year‐old patient presented with more pronounced skin laxity on the left side of her face. The same approach was applied, with EndoliftX alone on the right side and the combination of EndoliftX and Lightscan on the left side. At the 15‐day follow‐up, the left hemiface demonstrated faster and more significant improvement, with reduced sagging and improved skin texture, leading to a noticeable reduction in facial asymmetry (Figures 4A–D, 5A–D).

        3.3
        Case 3
        In the third case, a 62‐year‐old woman had more severe signs of aging on the right hemiface. The right side received the combination therapy, while the left side was treated with EndoliftX alone. After 15 days, the right side showed a marked reduction in wrinkles and laxity, improving the symmetry and creating a more youthful appearance (Figures 6A,B, 7A–D).

        All three patients successfully completed the treatment protocol and 15 days follow‐up evaluation. No AEs—such as prolonged erythema, edema, dyschromia, scarring, infection, or sensory alterations—were reported. All procedures were well tolerated under local anesthesia, and no postoperative analgesics were required.
      
      
        3.4
        Clinician‐Based Outcomes
        Photographic comparisons using standardized frontal and lateral images revealed measurable improvements in facial symmetry, skin laxity, and contour definition, particularly on the hemiface treated with the combination of EndoliftX and Lightscan. These observations were quantified using validated scoring systems.
GAIS (clinician‐rated): The hemiface treated with the combination therapy received GAIS scores ranging from four to five, corresponding to “much improved” and “very much improved”. The control side, treated with EndoliftX alone, consistently received a GAIS score of three (“improved”) across all cases.Lemperle Wrinkle Severity Scale: A reduction of one to two points in wrinkle depth was observed on the combination‐treated side, compared to a maximum of one‐point improvement on the control side.

      
      
        3.5
        Patient‐Reported Outcomes
        
GAIS (patient‐rated): The combination‐treated side was rated as “very much improved” in two patients and “much improved” in one. All patients rated the EndoliftX‐only side as “improved” (score = 3).Treatment satisfaction: All patients reported maximum satisfaction with the procedure, rating it five out of five on the Likert scale.Pain perception (VAS): Pain was self‐reported using a 10‐point VAS. The hemiface treated with EndoliftX + Lightscan showed slightly higher scores (VAS 2–3) compared to the EndoliftX‐only side (VAS 1–2), though overall discomfort remained mild and well tolerated.

        Data include clinician‐ and patient‐rated GAIS scores, changes in wrinkle severity according to the Lemperle scale (Δ from baseline), VAS pain scores for each side, and overall patient satisfaction. The combination treatment consistently resulted in higher GAIS scores and greater wrinkle improvement, with only slightly increased procedural discomfort.

      Discussion
      Chronological aging progresses naturally over time, leading to the gradual degradation of collagen and elastin fibers in the skin, diminishing its firmness and elasticity. Conversely, photoaging results from prolonged exposure to UV radiation, accelerating these effects and contributing to early signs, such as wrinkles, laxity, and uneven texture. Both mechanisms result in visible facial aging, often characterized by asymmetry, volume redistribution, and skin quality deterioration [14].
      This study highlights the synergistic benefits of combining EndoliftX's targeted fat tissue action and collagen remodeling [15] with Lightscan's skin quality enhancement. Lightscan's multi‐depth penetration allows tailored treatments for concerns like fine lines, wrinkles, and pigmentation irregularities, enhancing texture, firmness, and overall quality for a youthful complexion. By targeting dermal water, it effectively addresses diverse skin conditions while minimizing collateral damage [16].
      The dual approach led to greater clinical improvements—as evidenced by both clinician and patient scores—compared to EndoliftX monotherapy. These results suggest that combining a subdermal contouring laser with a fractional, non‐ablative resurfacing laser yields more balanced and comprehensive rejuvenation, particularly when asymmetry is present.
      The inclusion of both objective (clinician GAIS, wrinkle scales) and subjective (patient GAIS, satisfaction ratings) assessments strengthens the validity of the findings.
      Notably, although the Lightscan component induced slightly higher pain perception, the discomfort remained mild and transient in all cases, with no AEs reported.
      The use of local anesthesia prior to the EndoliftX procedure likely improved patient comfort and procedural tolerability overall.
      These findings support the feasibility, safety, and aesthetic superiority of a combined EndoliftX + Lightscan protocol for managing age‐related hemifacial asymmetry.

      Conclusion
      This case series supports the potential of a dual‐laser strategy—EndoliftX combined with Lightscan—as a safe and effective approach to correct age‐related facial asymmetry. The treatment offered a favorable balance between efficacy and patient comfort. The integration of subdermal and superficial tissue targeting resulted in superior outcomes compared to monotherapy, particularly in terms of symmetry restoration and patient satisfaction. These promising findings warrant further investigation in large scale studies to validate long‐term efficacy and standardize treatment protocols.

Title: Advances in clinical applications of microneedle

Abstract: Microneedle (MN) technology, characterized by its micron-scale structure, can effectively break through the skin barrier, enhance the efficiency of transdermal drug delivery and achieve precise biosignal detection. Research indicates that MNs demonstrate superior safety and efficacy in clinical applications, significantly improving drug delivery efficiency, enhancing patient compliance and reducing side effects. In the field of biosensing, the combination of MN arrays and biosensors enables highly sensitive real-time monitoring of biomarkers. In cancer treatment, MNs exhibit potential for targeted drug delivery, gene therapy, and immunostimulation. Moreover, MNs present broad prospects in wound healing, scar repair, anti-aging and skin disease treatment. This review aims to systematically summarize recent advances in MNs applications across transdermal drug delivery, biosensing, cancer therapy, and skin disease repair through recent high-quality studies, and to explore future development prospects.

Body: 1 Introduction
      Drug delivery technologies have facilitated the development of numerous therapeutics, and various formulations enhance patient outcomes by improving targeted delivery, minimizing off-target accumulation, and promoting compliance (Zhuang et al., 2024). An effective drug delivery technology not only fulfills its therapeutic objectives but also enhances the overall patient experience. Such a need has given rise to MNs, an innovative platform that goes beyond the traditional mode of drug delivery methods (Figure 1).

          Brief introduction to delivery mechanisms through different types of MN patches.

Each type penetrates skin layers (epidermis, dermis, subcutaneous) differently, releasing drugs or forming pathways for substance absorption. Arrows indicate process steps.
        
      
      MNs were developed by Henry et al., in 1998 using microfabrication techniques. They consist of an array of fine needles (100–1,000 μm in length) attached to a base (Larrañeta et al., 2016). Subsequently, Henry et al. applied MNs for transdermal delivery of calcineurin Currently, MNs have been extensively reported for transdermal delivery of small molecule drugs, nucleic acids, peptides, proteins and other substances (Weng et al., 2023). With the development of science and technology, MNs, as a novel minimally invasive transdermal technology, have gradually gained attention in the medical field. In 2020, microneedling was ranked as the first of the top ten emerging technologies that were expected to transform the world by Scientific American, an authoritative science magazine (Fu et al., 2024).
      MNs can break through the skin’s stratum corneum - the main barrier to transdermal drug delivery - in a minimally invasive way. They consist of small, sharp micrometer-sized arrays, which leave microchannels in the skin after penetrating the skin, and can improve the permeability of drug molecules through the skin (Li et al., 2025). MNs offer several advantages, including minimal invasiveness and pain, rapid onset of action, safety, independence from molecular size or polarity, and high patient compliance (Shin et al., 2022). First pass elimination and gastrointestinal reactions can also be avoided compared to oral administration (Liu et al., 2022). In addition to large-scale transdermal drug delivery, MNs have also been widely used in vaccination, diagnostic testing, medical cosmetology and other biomedical fields in recent years (Zhuang et al., 2024). MNs, initially developed as a replacement for traditional syringes, have gradually evolved toward theranostic integrations. The range of MN-based technologies continues to expand, and its future development remains highly anticipated.
      Currently, numerous researchers have conducted comprehensive reviews on various applications of MNs, including specialized analyses of bioelectronic sensors (Vora et al., 2023) or molecular biomarker detection (Li et al., 2024). Compared to these existing studies, our work provides a concise overview of MNs clinical applications while incorporating more recent research advancements. We systematically analyze the strengths and limitations of MNs, aiming to provide methodological insights that may inform future research and innovation in this domain.
    
    
      2 Transdermal drug delivery
      Transdermal drug delivery systems mediated by MN patches have a higher acceptability and safety compared to conventional drug delivery systems. While traditional transdermal drug delivery systems can avoid gastrointestinal and first-pass reactions compared to oral drug delivery, the skin barrier can limit the efficiency of drug delivery. MN patches, on the other hand, can painlessly penetrate the skin barrier without causing pain, increasing the efficiency of drug delivery and improving patient compliance (Larrañeta et al., 2016). Currently, key challenges include poor control over delivery depth, inadequate regulation of immune effects, and insufficient responsiveness at target sites. If there is a breakthrough in delivery depth control, immune balance regulation and industrialization, the modular design of MNs provides a new paradigm for the transformation of traditional drug delivery and personalized tumor immunotherapy.
      
        2.1 Vaccines
        
          2.1.1 Cancer vaccines
          Weng et al. were the first to employ a peptide vaccine (TMV-PEP3) conjugated with tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) for immunotherapy of tumors such as triple-negative breast cancer delivered via dissolving MNs to effectively induce specific antibodies and cytotoxic responses. This study used MNs in combination with a nanovaccine targeting DCs for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, which successfully avoided conventional targets, fully utilized dendritic cells as an abundant targeting resource in the skin, and effectively blocked the low-target rate-limiting phase of tumor immunity (Weng et al., 2023). In addition, researchers used Prussian blue nanoparticles to induce immunogenic cell death of tumor cells followed by delivery to subcutaneous T cells via porous gelatin MNs to activate anti-lymphoma immune responses. The key advantage of this achievement lies in the controllable manufacturing of cancer cells (Fu et al., 2024). However, uniform dispersion of nanoparticles in the MN matrix still remains a challenge.
          Recently, in order to promote dendritic cell activation, significantly enhance immune response to tumor antigens (e.g., ovalbumin), and delay tumor growth, Li et al. (2025) were inspired by ice-pop to fabricate photothermal ultra-swelling MN (PUSMN), which triggered localized photothermal effects through near infrared, which was just enough to achieve the effect. Given its ease of use, efficiency and safety, this biocompatible PUSMN patch could greatly improve cancer vaccination. However, the depth of thermal penetration of photothermal therapy needed to be validated to match the tumor site.
        
        
          2.1.2 Vaccines against viral diseases
          Starting with the common influenza virus, researchers had targeted the persistent mutations of the H3N2 strain. Considering the time-sensitivity of influenza protection, they had combined high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with MN-based injection, effectively providing protection against multiple antigen variants (Shin et al., 2022). Furthermore, researchers had demonstrated in a mouse model that dissolving MN H7N9 vaccines had a long in vivo retention of virus antigen compared to traditional intramuscular injections and may serve as an effective route of immunization (Liu et al., 2022).
          In addition, fluoropolymer-modified nanovaccines (FiR MNVs) for rabies were delivered via MN, significantly enhancing neutralizing antibody levels and providing 6 weeks of complete protection (Deng et al., 2023). Dissolving MN patch system for AIDS (HIV) delivered Bictegravir and Tenofovir prodrugs for long-lasting plasma concentration maintenance as an alternative to oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (Figure 2) (Zhang C. et al., 2024). Qβ Virus-like Particle (VLP) MN vaccine for HPV Virus is room-temperature stable, induced neutralizing antibodies through a dose-sparing effect, and supported self-vaccination (Ray et al., 2022). Dry-coated chimeric dengue virus vaccine for dengue high-density microarray patch (HD-MAP) retained 100% efficacy after 6 months of 4°C storage (Choo et al., 2021). Polyphosphazene-based MNs for Ebola virus loaded on glycoprotein antigens to induce long-lasting antibodies that completely protect mice against lethal doses of virus (Romanyuk et al., 2023). These different types in MNs had accomplished the protection of their autoimmune effects, and it could be said that MNs had not only achieved protection in transportation but also surpassed immunity after vaccination.

              Fabrication and rationalization of nanoparticle-loaded MNs (Dissolving MNs containing either BIC or TAF SDNs were fabricated in a two-step process. Needle tips were formulated by mixing lyophilized BIC/TAF SDN with an aqueous polymer blend in a 1:1 weight ratio. The aqueous mixture was then homogenized with a Speedmixer, and poured onto a silicone MNs mould to cast the first layer of the MN array. The second layer consisted of prefabricated silicone green ring inserts fixed to the mold surface with aqueous substrate gel. This dissolving MN can be used in HIV PrEP for long-lasting plasma concentration maintenance) (Zhang C. et al., 2024).

          2.1.3 Vaccines against bacterial diseases
          
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium responsible for gonorrhea infections, had produced a significant number of gonorrhea patients globally and had gradually developed resistance to anti-microbial drugs over the years. Bagwe et al. evaluated vaccine efficacy by delivering inactivated compound gonococcal microparticles adjuvant (Alum/AddaVax) via MN to female mice, inducing the production of mucosal IgA and serum bactericidal antibodies. The mice showed enhanced expression of CD4 and CD8 cells in the spleen and lymph nodes, demonstrating a cellular immune response and accelerated bacterial clearance. This result broadens the understanding of the immune pathway of gonorrhea and demonstrated strong immunogenicity (Bagwe et al., 2023).
          The investigators developed a method for MNs based on 30% w/w poly (methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride) water mixtures. Both empty and antigen-loaded MNs were prepared using the outer membrane vesicles of Shigella flexneri as an antigenic model. In vivo immunization and conservation studies demonstrated that trans-auricular intradermal immunization of mice with MNs containing 200 µg of the antigenic complex triggered the production of specific systemic IgG and mucosal IgA, which protected the mice against experimental Shigella flexneri infections after 4 weeks of immunization. This study demonstrated for the first time the potential of dissolving MNs loaded with outer membrane vesicles for intradermal vaccination against enteric pathogens such as Shigella (Pastor et al., 2019). It should be noted that the antigen-antibody complex required for this study has a large drug loading capacity, and in the future, it would be necessary to reduce the drug loading capacity to achieve the corresponding effect. At the same time, the rate of degradation of the hydrogel matrix needed to be matched with the antigen to optimize drug activity and release profiles. In tuberculosis prevention, scientists developed dissolving MNs for the delivery of Ag85B DNA vaccine. High-dose MN vaccination elicited a better antibody response than traditional intramuscular injection, and also led to higher levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α produced by splenic lymphocytes. Animal experiments showed significant reductions in viable counts and prolonged survival in the lungs and spleens of the high-dose MN-inoculated group of mice. This suggested that MN inoculation might provide more effective protection than intramuscular injection. However, to enhance the immunization effect of MN-delivered Ag85B DNA vaccine, improvements such as increasing the MN loading and adding suitable adjuvants deserved further investigation (Yan et al., 2018).
        
      
      
        2.2 Contraceptive
        Although contraceptive methods had improved considerably, there were about 121 million unintended pregnancies in women globally each year from 2015 to 2019 (Bearak et al., 2020). Unintended pregnancies impose a huge economic and emotional burden on women and society, mainly because existing contraceptive methods could not satisfy the needs of different women in different situations, Prausnitz and his co-workers (Figure 3) (Li et al., 2019) demonstrated a MN patch made of safe biodegradable material, which can be briefly and painlessly applied to the skin by the patient, and then the MN could be broken and embedded in the skin to release the contraceptive pill continuously for a period of time. The MN not only solved the problem of patient accessibility, low maneuverability and limited safety of some contraceptives, but also synchronizes material degradation with the contraceptive cycle, avoiding drug residues, and was able to satisfy the patients’ needs for long-term contraception. The only caveat is that the safety issue for MN-carrying contraceptives needed to be properly addressed when they are put into use.
        
          FIGURE 3
          
            Rapidly separable MN patch for the sustained release of a contraceptive (A MN patch with rapidly separable biodegradable polylactic acid and polylactic-co-glycolic acid needles can continuously release levonorgestrel. Bubble structures between each MN and the patch backing allow the MNs to efficiently penetrate skin under compression, and to snap off under shear within 5 s after patch administration, leaving the MNs inside the skin, which allows for the slow and safe release of levonorgestrel in the body over weeks or even months, providing long-lasting contraceptive efficacy) (adapted with permission from Li et al., 2019.

A detailed view shows layers like adhesive paper, PVA/sucrose backing, and contraceptive hormones. Shear force releases hormones, depicted by changes in skin layers, leading to sustained hormone release for contraception.
          
        
      
      
        2.3 Anesthesia
        In modern society, pain management was a rather challenging issue, and it was crucial to ensure a fast, effective approach while providing patients with a relatively comfortable experience. Babakurd et al. (2024) used MN patches dissolved with anesthetic EMLA cream for preoperative management of children requiring palatal anesthesia. They then conducted a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness, which showed that the anesthetic MN patches significantly reduced the pain of anesthesia in children and had the potential to improve compliance compared to conventional palatal injections. Liu X. et al. (2024) developed a mosquito proboscis-inspired cambered MN patch for anesthesia of the ocular region. The patch creates MN apertures in the cornea that healed completely within 24 h, and the mosquito proboscis-inspired structure made the patient barely feel any significant pain, potentially offering a minimally invasive yet effective alternative delivery system.
        Recently, Mao et al. (2024) used a dissolvable hollow MN casing allowing the anesthetic, such as lidocaine hydrochloride, to be quickly released into the skin upon insertion, achieving rapid analgesic effects. This approach had already been validated in rats. Similarly, Wang’s team integrated an iontophoresis-driven device, controlled by a smartphone, into conventional dissolvable MNs, enabling patients to accomplish self-control of regional pain in the body. This strategy of combining dissolving, infiltrating, and controllable iontophoresis therapy had largely contributed to the precision and controllability of MN drug delivery (Wang et al., 2025).
      
      
        2.4 Specialized types of drug administration
        
Zhong et al. (2024) used a drug-loaded MN array to deliver riboflavin to the posterior sclera. The μ-LEDs embedded in the patch emitted blue light, inducing collagen cross-linking, which strengthened the sclera and maintained its thickness, thereby slowing the recurrence of myopia caused by scleral thinning and stretching. In experiments on pigs and New Zealand rabbits, no structural or degenerative changes were observed, demonstrating short-term safety and laying the foundation for potential myopia treatment in humans. However, this study did not assess the potential phototoxicity of blue light on the retina after long-term exposure and did not explore the possible effects of changes in scleral elasticity after cross-linking on the regulation of ocular physiological functions. In addition, this technique required a combination of MN implantation and external light equipment, which might face the problems of cumbersome operation and low patient compliance during clinical translation. Based on the research trend, Gade et al. (2024) determined that the use of stainless steel MNs with a bevel angle of 60° could achieve the maximum scleral depth at an injection angle of 45°, maximizing the range of distribution of the drug within the sclera, and this study optimized the MNs on their own terms, expanding the range of action of the drug molecules. However, since the experiment was based on isolated sclera, the effects of variables such as blood flow and intraocular pressure in living tissue on drug distribution were not considered. In addition, if the stainless-steel material was replaced with a more biocompatible material, it might be possible to better balance the depth of MN probing with safety.
      
    
    
      3 Microenvironmental molecule and signal detection
      
        3.1 Glucose
        Real-time monitoring and regulation of patient glucose levels had long posed significant challenges. The earliest application of MNs for insulin delivery was pioneered by McAllister in 2003, who successfully administered insulin through hollow MNs using external pressure (McAllister et al., 2003), resembling conventional injection methods. Subsequently, Prausnitz’s team experimentally demonstrated the superior pharmacokinetic properties of MNs in drug delivery (McAllister et al., 2003), establishing foundational theories for diabetes management systems.
        Integrating insulin delivery with glucose monitoring necessitated the incorporation of micropumps and detection components on MN arrays. Ma first introduced piezoelectric (PZT) pumps for insulin transport (Ma et al., 2006), leveraging their advantages of ultra-low operating frequency, rapid response, and high reliability. Building on this, Meshkinfam’s team designed and simulated programmable insulin release processes (Meshkinfam and Rizvi, 2021). While these advancements propelled drug delivery technology, system integration complexities hindered manufacturing until the emergence of microfluidics-integrated MNs. This technology enabled precise fluid manipulation (flow rate, concentration, etc.) for rapid small-volume transport and mixing. Takeuchi’s integration of microfluidics with MNs achieved simultaneous glucose detection (Takeuchi et al., 2019), allowing real-time interstitial fluid analysis during drug delivery. Alternative approaches involving electrochemical conversion of glucose fluctuations into measurable currents have also shown promise.
        Advancements in integration technologies led to Lee et al.'s development of graphene hybrid device arrays (Lee et al., 2016), incorporating sweat-control layers and temperature-responsive bioresorbable MNs for sweat-based glucose/pH monitoring and thermoresponsive drug release. Recently, Cui’s team (Liu Y. et al., 2024) engineered a wearable MN patch system featuring polystyrene hollow MN arrays penetrating the dermis, graphene biosensors, and chemically functionalized electroosmotic micropumps (Figure 4). This closed-loop system continuously monitored interstitial fluid glucose levels - which correlate strongly with plasma/serum biomarkers (Lee et al., 2016)– while delivering insulin through electroosmotic actuation, achieving glycemic control within 2 h without manual dosage calculation.
        
          FIGURE 4
          
            MN-based Closed-loop Glucose Monitoring and Regulation System (The graphene-PB modified MN electrode detects interstitial glucose levels and transmits signals to a PCB. When glucose exceeds a preset threshold, the PCB activates an electroosmotic micropump, releasing insulin from the reservoir via hollow MNs for 10 min. Glucose sensing then resumes, enabling alternating cycles of detection and insulin delivery until normoglycemia is restored) (Liu Y. et al., 2024).
          
          
            Diagram illustrating a closed-loop control system for blood glucose management. A controller operates an electroosmotic micro pump, which interacts with subjects. A microneedle biosensor monitors blood glucose, sending signals back to the controller. The process involves a cycle of current signals and glucose monitoring to trigger responses for regulation.
          
        
        From simple injection improvements in the early 2000s to integrated monitoring modules and ultimately closed-loop systems combining glucose sensing with drug delivery, MN technology had evolved exponentially. Future enhancements in signal detection systems promised geometrically optimized patches capable of capturing molecular dynamics with heightened sensitivity, adaptable to diverse clinical scenarios. This progression heraldeda transformative era in autonomous diabetes management.
      
      
        3.2 Cytochrome C
        Cytochrome C (Cyt c) is one of the typical electron delivery carriers (Morse et al., 2024), which is crucial for understanding the metabolic state and apoptotic mechanism of microorganisms at the biofilm-material interface. The conventional methods for detecting cytochrome C content in the biomembrane interface microenvironment require a combination of proteomics, mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, etc. However, these methods are limited by the high cost of instruments and complex operating procedures, resulting in less-than-ideal detection efficiency for cytochrome C. Thanks to the excellent biocompatibility of MN materials and simple manufacturing process, An et al. (2025) used DNA/MeHA gels as the MN tip and optimized the MN fabrication parameters to ensure its mechanical strength and water absorption capacity, which allowed the MNs to penetrate the biomembrane. By combining fluorescence staining techniques, they effectively eliminated interference, enhancing the signal between cytochrome C and the MNs, significantly improving the sensitivity and accuracy of the detection. This study introduces a novel method for detecting cytochrome c (Cyt c) in the biofilm-material interfacial microenvironment with hydrogel MN arrays. The detection of interfacial microenvironments was critical to the understanding of complex physicochemical phenomena, but the detection of interfacial substances was a major challenge. Cyt c was critical to the understanding of microbial biofilm metabolism and apoptosis mechanisms. This new method for detecting cytochrome c (Cyt c) in the microenvironment of a biofilm - material interface using a hydrogel MN array enabled interfacial microenvironment detection, which was crucial for understanding complex physicochemical phenomena, but accurate and rapid detection of interfacial substances remained a major challenge.
      
      
        3.3 Steroids
        Cholesterol, as a major molecule in the composition of animal cell membranes, was of significance for the monitoring of cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Li Z. H. et al. (2023) added platinum (Pt) into the hollow MN material, which enabled the subsequent addition of cholesterol oxidase to couple to the surface of Pt. Finally, the cholesterol concentration was transmitted as an electrical signal through the platinum-enzyme sensor, resulting in reliable linear outcomes. The results showed that the MN sensor was capable of detecting cholesterol with high affinity and sensitivity over a dynamic range.
        Cortisol, as an important component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, cortisol dysregulation was often associated with stress disorders, anxiety, and Cushing’s syndrome. Measuring cortisol concentration in the interstitial skin fluid (ISF) might be useful to understand the changes in the human physiological state. Li et al. (Jing et al., 2024) used MNs as electrochemical biosensors to analyze the circadian rhythms of cortisol and to establish a correlation between cortisol in the interstitial skin fluid and blood cortisol levels.
      
      
        3.4 Ketone bodies
        
Moonla et al. (2024) demonstrated the application of a wearable MN patch platform for continuous monitoring of β - hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels in human interstitial skin fluid (ISF). The MN sensor was based on a gold-deposited platinum transducer modified with a polytoluidine blue O (poly - TBO) mediator layer, β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) cofactor. In vitro experiments showed that the sensor had high sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and good reproducibility for NADH and BHB detection. In human experiments, the MN sensor could dynamically track the changes of BHB levels in ISF after ketone beverage intake in healthy subjects, which was consistent with the trend of the results of the traditional blood test, but with a certain time lag. This MN sensor provideda promising means of dynamic BHB tracking for diabetic ketoacidosis management, personal nutrition, and health monitoring, and future in-depth studies of physiologic lag times and development of calibration algorithms were needed.
      
      
        3.5 Processing of bioelectric signals
        Human bioelectrical signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG) (Roberts et al., 2016) and electroencephalogram (EEG) (Opie et al., 2018) were important for the diagnosis and treatment of heart, brain and muscle-related disorders. Hyunjong et al. (Gwak et al., 2023) (Figure 5) used a Bi-In-Sn alloy-based ECG metal MN array to detect distinct P waves, QRS complexes, and T waves, meeting the requirements for electrocardiography. Building on this, (Liu Z. J. et al., 2024) developed multichannel MN dry electrode patches capable of distinguishing characteristic patterns of different diseases. The patch achieved single-MN-level accuracy with remarkable temporal and spatial resolution. Stable signals could be obviously obtained on the ECG recording tests of experimental rabbits, and multiple channels could show excellent synchronization.

During insertion, the MAE is connected to an impedance measurement system to record real-time electrical impedance spectra, enabling evaluation of skin–electrode contact characteristics and electrical performance under dynamic loading conditions) (Gwak et al., 2023).

        When evaluating the mechanical contractile force and collecting electrophysiological signals of cardiac organoids, these organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells had gradually become an important model for assessing cardiac toxicity. However, real-time, in situ detection of the mechanical contractile force and electrophysiological signals of cardiac organoids remained a major challenge. Yin et al. (2025) proposed a sensory system based on micromotor arrays and resistive skin sensors. The cardiac-like organs were placed in the MEA chip while the sensors were controlled at the topmost part of the organs to achieve reliable and simultaneous electromechanical measurements, and electro-mechanical parameters were collected for evaluating the cardiac-like organs and tissues.
        However, since MNs needed to accurately locate the sensor-tissue contact point, which would be very demanding on the operator’s skills, and miniaturized sensors might be interfered with by environmental noise, and multichannel systems needed to be supported by complex signal processing algorithms, data fusion was difficult, and the long-term electrochemical stability of the MN electrodes such as oxidation of alloys as well as the continued reliability of the sensors in organoid cultures still needed to be verified.
      
    
    
      4 Tumor diagnosis and treatment
      
        4.1 Melanoma diagnosis and treatment
        Characterized by easy recurrence, high mortality and high metastasis, cutaneous melanoma was one of the most aggressive skin cancers (van der Maaden et al., 2012). Tyrosinase (TYR) was a polyphenol oxidase essential for the synthesis of melanin, whose overexpression and accumulation in skin cells was considered to be an important marker of melanoma. Therefore TYR was an important biomarker for melanoma diagnosis (Zhou et al., 2016). However, how to capture the real changes of TYR in suspicious skin remained a major challenge. Based on this, for efficient detection of TYR (Figure 6), Huang et al. (2023) designed an Au@Ag-Pt nanoparticle wearable MN for screening of potential melanoma. The MN was designed based on the principle that in the presence of TYR, catechol immobilized on MNs are preferentially oxidized to benzoquinone, which competitively hinders the interaction between MN and Au@Ag-Pt NPs, thereby triggering the SERS-colorimetric signal inter-switching. More importantly, the MN patch had demonstrated flexible and stretchable properties and could be firmly adhered to the skin without causing chemical or physical irritation. It was further shown that it has important clinical significance in the early diagnosis and monitoring of cutaneous melanoma.

Upon insertion into TYR-containing skin, TYR catalyzed catechol oxidation to benzoquinone, disrupting nanozyme attachment and switching the SERS signal “off” and colorimetric signal “on.” Signal intensity showed a negative linear correlation with TYR levels, enabling dual-mode TYR quantification.)

With TYR, catechol oxidizes to benzoquinone, blocking SERS spectra and turning the solution blue, indicating TYR presence.
          
        
        Based on the MN, an ultrafine microplatform, Pan et al. (2018) fabricated biologically safe dissolving polyethyleneimine (PEI) MNs for delivery of siRNA for STAT3 for targeted treatment of melanoma. STAT3 was a signal transducer and transcriptional activator associated with malignant cellular behaviors. SiRNAs were small interfering RNAs that cause gene silencing of the target gene and inhibit gene expression. This MN inserted into the skin could locally form a STAT3 siRNA-PEI complex to mediate the silencing of the STAT3 gene and directly inhibit the proliferation of melanoma, which had been shown to have good efficacy in mice.
      
      
        4.2 Diagnosis of breast cancer
        Breast cancer is one of the most common tumors threatening women’s health worldwide. In the diagnosis of breast cancer, the key is to detect epidermalgrowthfactorreceptor2 (ErbB2), a biomarker of breast cancer. Therefore, Dervisevic et al. (2021) designed a high-density gold-plated silicon MN array for ErbB2, which functioned as both a biomarker extractor and an electrochemical sensor, and was capable of selectively capturing ErbB2 with linearity over a concentration range of 10–250 μg-L-1, resulting in effective detection of ErbB2. The study opened up a new direction for the development of high-performance wearable nursing devices.
      
    
    
      5 Treatment of skin-related diseases
      
        5.1 Wound healing
        To accelerate wound healing in patients, researchers had designed a two-phase MN array that worked by mechanically interlocking the expandable MN tip with the skin tissue, which achieved about a 3.5-fold increase in adhesion strength in skin wound healing compared to traditional chemical adhesives. The MN array was more convenient and less time-consuming than suturing wounds, prevented gas or liquid leakage, and reduced tissue damage by evenly distributing the applied mechanical stress. It was worth noting that the MNs could also be combined with transdermal drug delivery to accelerate wound healing by delivering substances such as anti-inflammatory and crude regenerative molecules to the target site through reversible microchannels. The experimental results showed that the MN array could improve wound healing in diabetic patients by increasing the delivery efficiency. At the same time, Liu et al. (2025) demonstrated that MNs could respond to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the diabetic microenvironment and subsequently produced oxygen (O2) and nitric oxide (NO). These gases comprehensively promoted neurovascular regeneration, reduced oxidative stress levels, and reduced inflammation.
        In addition, the material of the MN itself might be a good solution to the wound problem. As a two-dimensional inorganic chemosynthetic material, MXenethe could damage the bacterial membrane in direct contact with the bacteria (Seidi et al., 2023), achieving the therapeutic efficacy of antibacterial promotion of wound healing. When MXene as a MN base material, together with the other antimicrobial drug filling, this kind of MN patches for wound healing provided a new strategy (Hu et al., 2024).
      
      
        5.2 Scar repair
        
Yang et al. (2024) (Figure 7) made the hypothesis that drug-carrying MNs could inhibit fibroblast regeneration and mediate keratinocyte differentiation to reduce collagen fiber production. They experimentally demonstrated that drug-carrying MNs could remodel the pathological microenvironment of the scar tissue through reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and depletion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). It revealed the potential mechanism of repairing scar and provided new ideas to clinically solve this shape problem of patients. However, the study lacked long-term follow-up data beyond 6 months, the effect of the degradation products of the MN material on the tissue had not been clarified, and the technique did not involve studies of individualized dosing regimens for patients with different skin types and scarring stages, so clinical applicability was not yet certain.

Using a rabbit ear HS model verified that the relationship between MNs drug loading and scar thickness) (Yang et al., 2024).

        5.3 Pigmentation
        
Sawutdeechaikul et al. (2021) conducted a study on dissolvable and detachable MNs loaded with glutathione and vitamin C. To exclude factors such as infection, inflammation, and immune cell regulation, they selected volunteers some time after acne occurrence. The volunteers used the MNs daily, and their melanin index was measured using a skin colorimeter. After 4 weeks, the MN treatment group showed a significant reduction in melanin compared to the control group. The authors did not explore the feasibility of simplifying the frequency of administration, although they concluded that daily microneedling might affect patient tolerance, and the subject population was limited to the post-acne hyperpigmentation group, with no verification of generalizability to other types of pigmentation such as melasma and photodamaged spots.
      
      
        5.4 Skin aging
        Skin aging is characterized by endogenous factors of heredity and genes, and also accepted the influence of exogenous factors such as environmental exposure, nutritional intake, etc. These combined factors ultimately led to the disruption of the cellular microenvironment, and the decline in the water content of the extracellular matrix, causing the slowing down of the cellular metabolism and the reduction of elasticity and collagen fibers, which accelerated the aging process of the skin (Li S. Z. et al., 2023). Researchers used polysaccharides and proteins to create a three-dimensional network structure, and hydrogel MNs made of this material could well provide a growth environment for the cells again, improved the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of the senescent cells, and slowed down the aging process (Zhang et al., 2025).
      
      
        5.5 Treatment of psoriasis
        
Zhou et al. (2023) used iontophoresis-driven MN patches loaded with dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dex) for the treatment of psoriasis in mice and found that typical signs of psoriasis, such as dryness, thickening, erythema, and scaly skin, disappeared after 5 days, where dexamethasone sodium phosphate was able to be released consistently and stably. Le Thanh et al. (2014) designed heparin-coated porous MNs (HPMN) to capture and remove the inflammatory chemokine MCP-1 and deplete inflammatory monocytes to alleviate persistent inflammation. Heparin was covalently cross-linked to the surface of the MNs to enhance chemokine capture, while the porous structure of the MNs served as channels for monocyte infiltration. In a psoriasis mouse model, the treatment resulted in a reduction in epidermal thickness and immune cell infiltration. However, while Zhou was biased towards the optimization of drug delivery, Le was biased towards optimizing the structure of MNs. In the future, electrically responsive smart MNs could be constructed in psoriasis treatment, which was expected to achieve on-demand drug release that could be triggered according to pH or inflammatory factor concentration, while targeting to regulate the immune microenvironment to enhance the precision and safety of psoriasis treatment.
      
      
        5.6 Resolution of androgenetic alopecia
        For androgenetic alopecia (AGA), PRP - MNs currently provided painless, minimally invasive and sustainable PRP-promoted hair growth (Sun et al., 2024); AR - PROTAC - MNs showed highly biocompatible, one-step delivery and long-lasting efficacy without systemic toxicity or androgen deficiency-related disorders (Wang et al., 2023); DMN - VPA maximized VPA delivery while promoting hair follicle regeneration; there were also multiple MNs that exhibited different roles and limitations in AGA treatment (Fakhraei Lahiji et al., 2018). Additionally, some studies had explored the use of MNs for delivering drugs or other bioactive compounds to promote hair regeneration. For example, MNs-loaded drug delivery systems had been further developed for the treatment of AGA. Other research have investigated the use of conditioned medium (CM) (Yuan et al., 2022), stem cell-derived exosomes (Yang et al., 2019), and other bioactive compounds for therapeutic purposes.
      
    
    
      6 Others
      
        6.1 Treatment of neurodegenerative diseases
        
Zhang W. F. et al. (2024) (Figure 8) fabricated a self-powered triboelectric-responsive MNs system that could be used for sustained release of engineered extracellular vesicles as an alternative to traditional NSAIDs and traditional surgery for disc degeneration. They searched for inhibitory validation of new targets and mechanisms, which had clinical potentials for the treatment of degenerative diseases. Although this study improved TRAM1 protein loading efficiency using the EXPLOR technology, payload loading and vesicle engineering for extracellular vesicles in biological targeted therapy might still face challenges that required further optimization to enhanced therapeutic outcomes. Despite the promising preclinical results of tissue engineering strategies, the lack of integration between etiology-driven interventions and endogenous therapeutic mechanisms targeting degenerative molecules had prevented any method from being approved for clinical application to date.

During exercise, the system generates triboelectric signals that trigger the on-demand release of optogenetically engineered extracellular vesicles (EXPLOR-EVs) loaded with TRAM1 protein. These EVs function to restore endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization of TREX1, inhibit nuclear DNA damage, suppress cGAS-STING pathway activation, and thereby mitigate inflammation-associated IVDD progression) (Zhang W. F. et al., 2024).

        6.2 Exploration of the functionality of the MN chip system
        Early liver chips ignored the three-vessel structure and even the dynamic flow that had been shown to promote cell function and long-term culture. Liver chips with single-flow pathways as a vascular alternative later emerged to provide oxygen and nutrients to cultured cells and remove waste products. However, single-vessel structures were difficult to create physiologically similar oxygen and nutrient gradients in the cell culture zone, which was considered one of the main factors leading to the differentiation of functional zones of the liver alveoli. To deal with this deficiency, Li S. B. et al. (2023) constructed MN arrays that led to the formation of a perfusable hepatic sinusoids, which facilitated the flow of fluids in the culture zone and hepatic metabolism. The pioneering experiment provided new ideas for organoid development.
      
    
    
      7 Future direction and outlook
      MNs, as an innovative transdermal delivery system, have demonstrated remarkable progress in recent years across drug delivery, vaccination, disease diagnosis, and chronic disease management. By penetrating the stratum corneum with micron-sized needles, they enable painless and minimally invasive delivery of drugs or biomolecules while avoiding first-pass metabolism and systemic side effects. Current applications include successful delivery of insulin, vaccines (e.g., influenza and rabies vaccines), antifungal agents, and local anesthetics, with emerging potential in diabetes glucose monitoring and cancer immunotherapy. Clinical trials confirm that MNs enhance patient compliance, particularly benefiting pediatric and geriatric populations, as well as those with needle phobia.
      However, technological advancement inevitably faces challenges. Balancing material selection and structural design remains critical. MNs must maintain mechanical strength (for stratum corneum penetration) while ensuring biocompatibility (to prevent irritation or premature degradation). Existing materials—including silicon, metals, and hydrogels—present limitations in strength, degradation rate, or drug-loading capacity. For instance, hydrogel-based MNs offer dissolvable properties but constrained drug-loading capacity, whereas silicon MNs exhibit superior strength yet require post-application removal due to non-degradability. Developing composite materials with high drug-loading efficiency, tunable degradation profiles, and optimal skin compatibility could address these constraints. Furthermore, achieving spatiotemporal control over drug release kinetics and penetration depth remains technically challenging. In vaccine delivery, for example, rapid antigen release may compromise immunogenicity, while delayed release risks local inflammation. Emerging solutions involve stimuli-responsive MN designs (e.g., pH, temperature, or enzyme-activated materials) to achieve on-demand biomolecule release.
      Manufacturing scalability and quality control present another frontier. While traditional fabrication methods like photolithography and molding face high costs and suboptimal yield, next-generation techniques such as 3D printing and soft lithography show promise for high-throughput, cost-effective production. Standardized quality assessment protocols—evaluating mechanical integrity, drug-loading uniformity, and stability during storage/transportation—are urgently needed to ensure clinical viability. Cost optimization in manufacturing will further expand MN applications.
      Capitalizing on their adaptability and chip-integration potential, future MNs are poised to revolutionize precision medicine through multifunctional integration. Converging with microfluidic chips and biosensors could enable closed-loop “sample-to-therapy” systems that analyze biomarkers (e.g., glucose, inflammatory cytokines) and deliver tailored therapeutics. Synergy with gene/cell delivery technologies may enhance MN-mediated transport of CRISPR-Cas9, mRNA vaccines, or stem cells, propelling advances in gene therapy and regenerative medicine. As biocompatible materials evolve, these versatile platforms are anticipated to emerge as safe, efficient solutions across diverse medical scenarios.

      Biophotonics: A Short Definition and Overview
      Photonics encompasses the generation, control, manipulation, propagation, measurement, and utilization of light. Recognized as a key technology of the 21st century, photonic technologies play a crucial role in addressing significant societal challenges and driving advancements in areas like life sciences, communication, and production.
      Biophotonics is a rapidly advancing field at the intersection of light and biological systems, representing a significant leap forward in natural sciences, but also medicine. The term “biophotonics” combines the Greek words “bios” (life) and “phos” (light), reflecting its core focus: exploring how light interacts with biological matter. By leveraging photonics—the science and technology of manipulating light—biophotonics has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding and influencing life processes at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organ levels. The field seeks to understand biological processes through optical methods, drawing inspiration from nature—such as the way plants harness light through photosynthesis or the complex processes that occur in human vision. The journey to understanding light, from early antiquity to Albert Einstein's photon theory, parallels the challenge of comprehending life, studied from Aristotle to modern genomics (Figures 1).

      Biophotonics is not merely an academic pursuit; it offers groundbreaking possibilities for both fundamental research and practical applications across various industries, including pharmaceuticals, food, biotechnology, and most importantly medicine. Innovative optical techniques developed through biophotonics allow scientists to capture cellular conditions and monitor dynamic processes, providing a comprehensive view of life processes within biological systems (e.g., at molecular levels, in cells, in tissues, and in organs). Biophotonic techniques involve studying the structural, functional, mechanical, biological, and chemical properties of biological materials through light interactions such as absorption, emission, reflection, and scattering. In addition, lasers and other advanced light sources are applied for surgery and treatment. Given the vastness of the field, we refrain from citing original literature and instead provide a selection of comprehensive textbooks at the end of the text to help interested readers gain an overview [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] (Figures 2).
      
        FIGURE 2
        
          The three main areas of biophotonics in health: Bioimaging, biosensing, and treatment control.
        
        
      
      Some key advantages of using light in biophotonics include:
Non‐contact measurement: The utilization of light facilitates the observation of living cells in a noninvasive manner, thereby ensuring the preservation of the integrity of the analyzed cells and the absence of any toxic effects.Speed and instant information: Optical measurements have the capacity to provide rapid, real‐time data, thereby significantly reducing the time required for data interpretation and diagnosis.Sensitivity: Optical technologies allow for ultrasensitive detection, down to single molecules, which is essential to understand fundamental biological processes.Time resolution: Optical methods allow the observation of dynamic biological processes over a range of temporal scales, from hours to ultrafast reactions.

      One important goal of biophotonics is to unravel mechanisms behind the origins of diseases, enabling prevention, early diagnosis, and targeted or personalized treatment and follow‐up treatment. While the primary focus of biophotonics is on biology research and healthcare—promising early and accurate diagnosis and efficient treatment (including treatment with light)—it also extends to environmental monitoring and agricultural advancements.
      Achieving these ambitious goals requires interdisciplinary collaboration. Physicists, chemists, engineers, biologists, computer scientists, medical professionals, and industry stakeholders must work together to fully realize the potential of biophotonics. This cooperation is essential in transforming innovative observations made in the lab into diagnostic and treatment methods for patients addressing unmet medical needs.
      In summary, biophotonics stands at the forefront of scientific innovation, offering profound insights into biological or biomedical processes and paving the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. As the field continues to evolve, its impact on both science and society is poised to grow, making it a vital area of research and application in the 21st century.
      Before we come to the actual core of this manuscript, a critical review of the findings of the “International Congress on Biophotonics” in March 2024 (ICOB 2024), we would like to give a brief summary of the core topic of biophotonic research on the interaction of light‐biological matter, which is the basis of the most important biophotonic approaches that were also the subject of the ICOB 2024.
      
        2.1
        Biophotonics: A Short Summary of the Key Technologies
        The field of biophotonics can be divided into the following main areas:

Bioimaging: Photonics technologies enable the characterization of biological specimens across multiple spatial scales, from the nanoscopic level—facilitating the investigation of intracellular interactions—to the microscopic and macroscopic domains, including tissues and muscle structures.
Biosensing: Photonic‐based approaches allow for the detection of biomolecules, such as disease‐specific biomarkers, with sensitivities reaching molecular concentrations and, in principle, single‐molecule resolution.
Treatment and treatment control: Lasers and other light sources are in use for facilitating highly precise and minimally invasive surgical interventions, while bioimaging and biosensing modalities enable real‐time monitoring of treatment efficacy and post‐operative recovery biosensing.

        These three areas can efficiently run separately, but they can work in parallel, offering even greater potential.
        
          2.1.1
          Bioimaging
          The majority of currently available biophotonic techniques can be explained in terms of light‐biological matter interaction. The interaction phenomena are predominantly based on the processes of absorption, emission, scattering, and reflection. These phenomena are distinguished by their capacity to elucidate a vast array of morphological and molecular intricacies across a spectrum of size scales, encompassing macroscopic, microscopic, and nanoscopic resolutions.
          The most representative label‐free biophotonic diagnostic methods include hyperspectral imaging (HSI), fluorescence imaging and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of endogenous fluorophores, second harmonic generation (SHG), third harmonic generation (THG), optical coherence tomography (OCT), diffuse remission spectroscopy (DRS), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), vibrational microspectroscopy (infrared [IR] absorption and Raman scattering), and Brillouin scattering. The contrast mechanisms underlying these methods can be highly molecule‐specific in the case of IR absorption and Raman scattering; it can visualize native electronic chromophores such as hemoglobin, NADP(H), flavin, elastin, or cytochrome by absorption (HSI or PAI) or emission (autofluorescence or fluorescence label imaging); or it can visualize specific structural proteins (e.g., collagen) by SHG as well as changes in refractive index (OCT) or phase boundaries (THG).
          Molecular contrast is highest when spectroscopic data are acquired, as in HSI, FLIM, spontaneous or coherent Raman spectroscopy, or IR absorption spectroscopy. These techniques enable visualization of the spatial distribution of molecular markers such as proteins, lipids, or DNA. In contrast, methods such as OCT detect changes in refractive index, which are often not directly correlated with specific molecular structures but provide detailed imaging of tissue architecture down to the cellular level. Conventional OCT can be extended to spectroscopic OCT (SOCT), which provides localized spectroscopic information based on the principles of OCT. SOCT captures the spectral content of backscattered light, enabling the quantification of depth‐resolved spectra to determine the concentration of tissue chromophores (e.g., hemoglobin and bilirubin). However, acquiring spectral information is time‐consuming, so such methods are generally slower than methods that measure only a single parameter per pixel, such as normal OCT. OCT is currently one of the fastest methods in terms of volume elements (voxels) imaged per second, enabling real‐time 3D imaging of dynamic processes, and is already widely established in ophthalmology.
          It is useful to distinguish between linear and nonlinear light‐matter interaction phenomena. Recent advances in the development of compact and easy‐to‐operate high‐intensity ultrashort laser sources enabled the exploitation of nonlinear optical phenomena for biomedical imaging, resulting in significant improvements in penetration depth, optical resolution as well as acquisition speed. In particular, multi‐photon absorption is especially valuable for microscopy applications. Simultaneous absorption of two or three photons leads to precise localization of the sources of fluorescence or SHG and THG signals, since such nonlinear processes can only take place in an extremely small volume. Multi‐photon imaging using near IR (NIR) femtosecond lasers can provide high penetration depths and therefore allows the study of biological tissue with high spatial resolution and good contrast not only on the surface but also deep within the tissue.
          The disadvantage of linear Raman spectroscopy is the intrinsically small scattering cross‐sections, which make it impossible to acquire hyperspectral Raman images of larger tissue areas. This can be overcome by using nonlinear coherent Raman scattering (CRS) phenomena such as CARS (coherent anti‐Stokes Raman scattering) and SRS (stimulated Raman scattering). CARS and SRS enhance the intrinsically weak Raman signal and avoid being swamped by autofluorescence background, but they are reduced in molecular selectivity because they can image only one or a few characteristic Raman bands and are more complex than standard Raman approaches.
          Whereas the spatial resolution of the aforementioned optical imaging methods is usually limited by the diffraction limit, novel fluorescence‐based nanoscopy techniques such as STED, PALM/STORM, SIM, Airyscan, and MINFLUX enable us to go below the diffraction limit by utilizing optical fluorescence transitions. However, these super‐resolution fluorescence approaches are not label‐free and require environmental‐sensitive fluorescence probes. Such fluorescence nanoscopy techniques enable highly sensitive observation of subtle changes in cellular properties, such as membrane fluidity and integrity, particularly in response to inflammation. Moreover, novel approaches like adaptive optics or endoscopy allow for deeper imaging within tissue.
          To extend the potential of all these optical approaches, it has proven to be advantageous to combine several contrast mechanisms in a multimodal approach. Multi‐contrast imaging has become a powerful tool of biomedical research. One can think of two end‐member strategies for combining these diverse methods. On one end, imaging modalities with similar acquisition speed and resolution can be combined, for example, nonlinear imaging methods like Multi‐Photon Excited Fluorescence (MPEF), SHG, and CARS, all of which are efficiently excited by the same laser source and can be detected in parallel. On the other end, imaging modalities of different imaging speeds and tissue penetration can be synergistically combined, so that a fast but chemically less specific method provides an overview of the tissue volume or larger area, while a slower, molecule‐specific second method is used to classify tissues detected by the faster modality in suspicious but small areas. One such approach would be to combine OCT or FLIM with Raman (Figure 3).

          2.1.2
          Biosensing
          Unlike bioimaging, where most approaches are label‐free, biosensing employs a more balanced approach, incorporating both label‐free and label‐based methods to detect and, when possible, to quantify specific biomolecules.
          
            2.1.2.1
            Label‐Free Approach
            Biomolecules can be detected using either their intrinsic optical properties (fluorescence, absorption, and Raman scattering) or through an indirect measurement of refractive index changes induced by the biomolecular interaction between the biomolecule and a biological recognition element (antibodies, enzymes, nucleic acids, aptamers, among others).
            In the initial case, for instance, the presence of bile within the gastroesophageal tract can be identified through the measurement of bilirubin absorption within the gastroesophageal content. The utilization of optical fiber catheters, culminating in a mini‐spectrophotometric cell that is open to the external environment, facilitates uninterrupted, 24‐h monitoring of bile‐containing refluxes. In Raman scattering, the performances characterized by an intrinsically weak cross‐section can be greatly improved by developing sensing probes using metallic surfaces, mainly gold, and silver, as substrates for the biosensing layer interacting with specific biomolecules. With this approach, the so‐called surface‐enhanced Raman scattering, the huge local enhancement of the electromagnetic field over nanometric distances from the metal surfaces leads to up to a million‐fold increase of the Raman signal leading to the achievement of very low limit of detections.
            A biosensing layer containing the biological recognition element and deposited on suitable surfaces is also used when the measurement of the biomolecule concentration is carried out through a measurement of refractive index changes. In optical biosensors based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR), the biosensing layer is deposited on gold surfaces and the interaction between optical waves and propagating surface plasmons occurs on macroscopic surfaces with plasmon propagation lengths in the micron range. The condition of coupling between the optical wave and the surface plasmon is modulated by the change of the refractive index of the biosensing layer and the shift in the resonance peak becomes dependent on the concentration of the biomolecules “captured” by the biosensing layer. In localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), gold nanostructures, such as nanoparticles, or array of nanoobjects on suitable substrates, are used: the light interaction is with localized surface plasmons that undergo collective harmonic oscillations under an applied electric field with the advantage that the excitation is performed with freely propagating light and does not require the special coupling geometries used in SPR such as prism coupling, grating coupling or waveguide coupling.
            Another label‐free approach exploits the use of optical resonators as extremely sensitive structures capable to go down to single molecule detection thanks to the incredibly high interaction of the so‐called whispering gallery modes (WGMs) propagating within optical cavities with the biosensing layer deposited on their surface. From the first application to bulk optical cavities such as glass microspheres, microrings, and microtoroids up to the optofluidic resonators as microbubbles, these structures can be characterized by unreachable performances even if excitation of WGM is often reached with not simple optical geometries.
            Optical waveguides are used as label‐free optical platforms for biosensing when the interactions with the biosensing layer occur through the cladding modes of the evanescent field that extends around the waveguide core in the fiber cladding. The interactions of the biomolecule with the biosensing layer induce changes in the refractive index surrounding the core that modulate the resonance peak of the cladding modes as a function of the biomolecule concentration. In the context of optical fiber waveguide biosensing, the most prevalent strategies encompass long‐period gratings, tilted fiber Bragg gratings, and fibers coated with a thin layer of metal oxide, which collectively facilitates lossy mode resonance.
          
          
            2.1.2.2
            Label‐Based Approach
            Fluorescence labels are widely used in in vitro biosensing for the detection and quantification of biomolecules, providing high sensitivity and specificity. These labels are fluorophores—molecules that absorb light at a specific wavelength and emit light at a longer wavelength—allowing researchers to track biological interactions in real time.
            Common applications of fluorescence labeling in biosensing include immunoassays, nucleic acid detection, and protein analysis. Fluorescent dyes, quantum dots, and fluorescent proteins such as GFP (green fluorescent protein) serve as reliable markers in these assays. Techniques like fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and FLIM further enhance detection accuracy by providing additional information about molecular interactions and environmental conditions.
            Fluorescent biosensors are extensively used in diagnostic platforms, including microarrays and lab‐on‐a‐chip devices, enabling rapid and precise disease detection. Moreover, the integration of fluorescence with advanced microscopy and flow cytometry allows for high‐throughput analysis of cellular and molecular processes.
            Despite their advantages, challenges such as photobleaching, background noise, and nonspecific binding must be addressed to improve assay performance. Ongoing research aims to develop brighter, more stable fluorophores and innovative labeling strategies to enhance the effectiveness of fluorescence‐based biosensing in biomedical applications (Figure 4).

          Treatment and Treatment Control
          Light‐based medical technologies have revolutionized modern healthcare by offering minimally invasive solutions for surgery, treatment and treatment control. Optical methods provide precise, targeted interventions, reducing patient recovery time while enhancing treatment efficacy. Advances in lasers, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and optical imaging have significantly improved patient outcomes across multiple medical fields.
          Laser surgery is one of the most prominent applications of light in modern medicine. Lasers provide precise cutting, coagulation, and ablation or fragmentation of tissues with minimal collateral damage. Various wavelengths are employed depending on tissue type and desired outcomes. For example, carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers are commonly used for soft tissue surgeries, while Nd:YAG and diode lasers are frequently employed in ophthalmology, dermatology, and oncology.
          One of the greatest advantages of laser surgery is its ability to minimize bleeding by sealing blood vessels as it cuts. This feature is particularly valuable in delicate procedures such as retinal surgery and neurosurgery. Additionally, robotic‐assisted laser surgery allows for highly accurate interventions, improving surgical precision and reducing human error.
          PDT is a widely used light‐based treatment, particularly in oncology and dermatology. PDT involves the administration of a photosensitizing agent that accumulates in diseased tissue. When exposed to specific wavelengths of light, the agent produces reactive oxygen species that selectively destroy abnormal cells while sparing healthy tissue. This approach has shown effectiveness in treating certain types of skin cancers, precancerous lesions, and macular degeneration (Figure 5).
          
            FIGURE 5

          In dermatology, intense pulsed light and laser therapy are used to treat conditions such as acne, vascular lesions, and pigmentation disorders. Similarly, low‐level laser therapy, also known as photobiomodulation, promotes tissue repair and reduces inflammation in conditions ranging from musculoskeletal injuries to chronic pain disorders.
          Furthermore, laser‐based techniques are increasingly employed in dentistry, where they facilitate cavity removal, gum disease treatment, and teeth whitening with reduced discomfort and improved precision.
          Optical imaging and sensor technologies as described above play a crucial role in monitoring treatment progress and ensuring therapeutic efficacy.
          Biosensing and bioimaging can be combined together offering outstanding performances as in the case of intracellular nanosensing with optical switches able to emit a fluorescent signal as a consequence of the interaction with intracellular biomolecules; for example, with this approach biomolecules such as RNA messengers can be detected in the cytoplasm and at the same time followed in their intracellular pathway; molecular switches can also be engineered to interact with specific portions of the RNA messengers blocking definite functionalities and acting as theranostic agents.
          Light‐based medical technologies have profoundly transformed surgical procedures, therapeutic interventions, and treatment monitoring. By offering precision, minimal invasiveness, and improved patient outcomes, optical methods continue to advance medicine across diverse disciplines. As research progresses, emerging innovations will further enhance the capabilities of light‐based technologies, paving the way for safer and more effective treatments in the future.

        International Congress on Biophotonics 2024—A Hub for International Experts in Optical Health Technologies
        From March 3 to 7, 2024, Jena served as a focal point for international experts in the field of biophotonics, with a particular emphasis on optical health technologies. The seventh edition of the International Congress on Biophotonics (ICOB 2024) brought together leading minds from science, technology, and medicine with representatives from the industry to discuss the future direction of this research field and to advance the implementation of light‐based technologies in clinical applications. The congress was organized by the Jena Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology (Leibniz‐IPHT).
        The event kicked off with Chemistry Nobel Laureate Stefan Hell on March 4. His pioneering work on light microscopy redefined the limits of spatial resolution, enabling profound insights into the nano‐world of living cells. This discovery opened new paths for biomedical research, from studying neurodegenerative diseases to exploring the mechanisms of cancer cells.
        The presentations at the ICOB 2024 emphasized the interdisciplinary nature of biophotonics as a pivotal field in the development of novel methodologies in medicine and healthcare, as well as for more precise environmental monitoring. The ICOB congress demonstrated the potential of innovative biophotonic approaches for the early detection and treatment of cancer and infectious diseases and presented successful examples of technology transfer.
        Biophotonic research is typically driven by unmet needs. The most important unmet needs that can be solved with biophotonic approaches are briefly summarized below, highlighting new application areas and also technological advances, as discussed in the corresponding sessions at ICOB.
      
      
        2.3
        New Applications of Biophotonics, New Technological Trends, Challenges, and Future Directions to Address Unmet Needs
        
          2.3.1
          Oncology
          In the field of oncology, biophotonic applications are driven by the critical need for early and accurate detection of tumors and cancerous growth, as well as for the development of effective treatment strategies, which include image‐guided surgery and treatment monitoring. Conventional diagnostic techniques frequently prove inadequate for achieving the discrimination between tumor and normal cells and tumor margin detection in radial and depth. Moreover, there is an urgent need for the development of new methods and approaches for rapid and reliable intraoperative tissue diagnosis, as well as tumor margin detection. Label‐free biophotonic techniques, including OCT, autofluorescence microscopy utilizing both fluorescence intensity and lifetime, PAI, higher harmonics generation, and linear and non‐linear Raman spectroscopy, represent the most significant approaches in this field. They offer high‐resolution imaging at the cellular level, facilitating the early detection and precise delineation of tumors, particularly when employed in a multimodal approach. These techniques facilitate accurate differentiation between malignant and benign tissues, thereby enhancing the possibility to detect the tumor margins and reducing recurrence rates. Biophotonic methods that require labels need to rely on labels that are already approved; otherwise, labels would require approvement of safety, efficacy, and quality like drugs.
          Another significant application in the field of oncology is PDT. This treatment entails the utilization of light‐sensitive pharmaceutical agents that are activated by specific wavelengths of light, thereby facilitating the selective destruction of cancer cells. PDT provides a minimally invasive alternative to conventional therapies, thereby reducing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Unfortunately, these agents also require drug approval. Moreover, the application of AI will help to analyze spectral data of complex biological matter.
        
        
          2.3.2
          Infectious Diseases
          The field of infectious diseases is characterized by a significant unmet need for the development of rapid and precise diagnostic methods. To successfully and rapidly treat infectious diseases, three unmet needs must be addressed: (i) determination of the immune response; (ii) rapid identification of the infection‐causing pathogen and, in the case of bacterial infections, its resistance pattern; and (iii) response to treatment. Biophotonics offers solutions through techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence‐based methods, which address these unmet needs. Biophotonic approaches can encompass the entire process chain, from sampling to the final diagnostic result. They have the potential to significantly reduce the critical parameter, namely time, to initiate a personalized, lifesaving therapy when compared to the gold standard, which is mostly culture‐based microbiology. By reducing the time required for diagnosis, biophotonics has the potential to enhance patient outcomes and contribute to the control of the spread of infectious diseases.
        
        
          2.3.3
          Cardiovascular Diseases
          Cardiovascular diseases represent a significant global burden in terms of morbidity and mortality. As with the aforementioned diseases, early detection and continuous monitoring are of vital importance for the prevention of severe events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Conventional diagnostic techniques may be perceived as invasive and uncomfortable by patients. In this context, biophotonic techniques such as OCT and PAI can provide non‐invasive, high‐resolution imaging of blood vessels and tissues, thereby facilitating the early detection of conditions such as arteriosclerosis.
          Furthermore, biophotonics plays a pivotal role in the guidance of cardiovascular and probe/catheter‐based minimally invasive surgeries. The capacity to image in real time during surgical procedures enables surgeons to accurately visualize blood flow and vessel morphology, thereby facilitating the precise placement of stents and other devices.
        
        
          2.3.4
          Neurodegenerative Diseases
          Additionally, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease pose considerable challenges with regard to early diagnosis and monitoring. These conditions are typified by insidious early symptoms and intricate pathologies that traditional imaging methods frequently prove unable to discern. Biophotonics provides researchers with powerful tools for studying these diseases at the molecular and cellular levels. Techniques such as two‐photon fluorescence microscopy and light‐sheet microscopy provide high‐resolution imaging of brain tissues, thereby enabling researchers to observe changes in neuronal structures and functions.
          Optogenetics, which employs light to regulate and observe neuronal activity, has facilitated a deeper comprehension of neural circuits and their involvement in neurodegenerative disorders. This technique enables the precise manipulation of specific neurons, thereby facilitating insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. The development of optical clearing methods that render tissues transparent has further enhanced the ability to study deep brain structures and connectivity.
          Biosensors can allow the detection of specific biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (e.g., tau protein, Amyloid β‐protein), the determination of which with very low limit of detection can offer the possibility of the identification of the disease at its very early stage.
        
        
          2.3.5
          Therapeutic Drug Discovery
          In order to develop new therapeutic agents and optimize existing treatments, drug monitoring discovery programs are addressing all of the above diseases. These programs routinely utilize biophotonic technologies for the assay of fundamental cell biology processes, mechanisms of action, and responses to drug candidates. Biophotonic techniques are ubiquitous in drug discovery, providing spectroscopic readouts of molecular processes in solution‐based assays and increasingly advanced automated microscopy readouts in high content analysis (HCA). Conventionally, drug discovery assays have utilized solution phase or “2D cell monolayers” because they are easily prepared for high throughput assays, transparent and highly amenable to optical techniques. However, there has been a recent surge of interest in assays utilizing more complex “3D” cell cultures, such as spheroids of cells that interact with each other and patient‐derived organoids that more accurately replicate human physiology when studying the responses of cells to drugs. The increased complexity of these 3D cell‐based disease models necessitates the development of increasingly sophisticated microscopy techniques and image data analysis pipelines.
          The measurement of the concentrations of the drugs after their administration is fundamental in many clinical applications, such as pulmonary infections, critical care medicine, neurology, and psychiatry. Narrow therapeutic ranges and variable pharmacokinetics from patient to patient impose a strict and frequent monitoring of the administrated drugs and the critical role of their dosage can define the alternative between life (efficacy) and death (either toxicity or subtherapeutic exposure). For example, in the case of transplanted patients, the dosage monitoring of immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporin A, tacrolimus, and mycophenolic acid) is a fundamental part of solid organ post‐transplant follow‐up with high levels generating side effects and low levels increasing the risk of rejection. Therapeutic drug monitoring is traditionally based on the measurement of the trough level, defined as the plasma level of a pharmaceutical product measured just before the next dose, but, in many cases, this is not sufficient and a frequent/continuous measurement of the administrated drugs is essential to follow exactly the pharmacokinetics individually and to determine efficiently the area under the plot of plasma concentration of a drug vs. time after dosage. Traditional laboratory methods such as chromatography do not consent to follow this strategy, and optical biosensors are becoming more and more essential with their potentiality of real‐time monitoring.
        
        
          2.3.6
          Well‐Being
          The field of biophotonics has expanded to encompass a range of applications in the domain of comprehensive health monitoring and well‐being. Wearable biophotonic sensors, such as those designed for noninvasive glucose monitoring, provide continuous health data that can be utilized for the management of chronic conditions like diabetes. These sensors utilize techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, NIR, and mid‐IR spectroscopy to quantify non‐invasively biochemical markers via the dermal route, offering a convenient alternative to traditional invasive blood tests.
          In the domain of personalized health, biophotonics facilitates the monitoring of a range of physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation, and hydration levels. Such real‐time data facilitates the maintenance of optimal health and the early detection of potential health issues. The incorporation of AI into these sensors facilitates enhanced data analysis, thereby providing actionable insights and personalized health recommendations, which are also useful for all other unmet needs.

These methods are indispensable for the surveillance of environmental health and the assurance of compliance with regulatory standards.
          In the context of water quality monitoring, biophotonics enables the detection of a range of pollutants, including heavy metals, pesticides, and microbial contaminants. These techniques provide data in real time, enabling prompt corrective action to avert environmental damage. Similarly, biophotonic sensors are employed for the monitoring of air quality, with the objective of detecting pollutants such as particulate matter and volatile organic compounds. In addition, light‐induced antimicrobial treatment can reduce contaminations (handrails, implants, contaminated surfaces, etc.). All this contributes to the creation of a healthier living environment.
        
        
          2.3.9
          New Applications: Further Topics

        The Leibniz Center for Photonics in Infection Research (LPI) (see https://lpi‐jena.de/en/), which was recently included in the German government's national roadmap, is an example of how these recommendations can be successfully implemented. In the context of the LPI, the integration of photonic methods into infection research will facilitate the emergence of novel diagnostic and targeted therapeutic light‐based approaches. Following the necessary approvals, these will be transferred directly to industrial production and clinical application. A key component of the LPI is the Technology Scout, who works with clinicians at the beginning of the value chain to identify optimal photonic solutions that have demonstrated efficacy in proof‐of‐concept studies for specific medical problems. The LPI can thus serve as a model for other medical problems, such as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases, with the goal of overcoming the “valley of death” of clinical translation in these areas as well. Certainly, other examples of exemplary institutions exist and could be mentioned as well (Figure 6).

Title: A Paradigm Shift in SSTI Management: The Multifunctional Role of Extracellular Vesicles

Abstract: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are becoming an urgent public health issue worldwide. The globe is facing a growing problem with drug-resistant germs, and current treatments are not quite cutting it. There is a real need for new therapies that can tackle these challenges more effectively. This brings us to an interesting question: Can extracellular vesicles (EVs) from different sources, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), immune cells, or even plants and animals, help in treating SSTIs, especially given the rise in drug resistance? Studies have shown that MSC-derived EVs are particularly noteworthy because they carry components such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that can work together to fight infections, boost the immune response, and aid in healing. These vesicles play a role in how our body interacts with infections, helping to clear bacteria, reduce inflammation, and promote tissue repair. We also see that EVs from plants and bacteria can directly fight off germs, while those from animals can support the healing process of skin. Although early studies have shown promise for EV therapies, there are still hurdles to overcome, such as ensuring consistent production and delivery. This review looks at the potential of EVs as powerful agents in managing infections and supporting healing, highlighting an exciting area of research in medicine.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are a diverse group of bacterial infections of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle planes [1]. They range from the mildest presentations (cellulitis) to more serious ones (necrotizing fasciitis) and are among the most common infections both in the community and in the hospital setting [2]. SSTIs are particularly prevalent among individuals with diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or compromised immunity [3,4] and are the third most frequent cause of emergency department visits [3].
      Globally, SSTIs have an estimated rate of 24.6 per 1000 person-years, with higher rates found in high-income nations such as the U.S. (77.5 per 1000 person-years) [5]. Hospitalization increased by 29% in the early 2000s, most frequently because of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus CA-MRSA [6,7]. Risk is age-, sex-, and socioeconomic-status-dependent, with highest incidence rates in the elderly and high-risk groups [5,6,7]. Hospital data estimate SSTIs contribute 7–10% to infection load [7], with unacceptably high incidences among diabetic patients—up to 86.5% in a study in Pakistan [8]. Resistance is also common, found in 47% of SSTIs in a Ugandan study on multidrug-resistant organisms [9] and over 64% in an Indian tertiary care hospital on Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter (ESKAPE) pathogens [10].
      Despite the fact that 70–75% of SSTI patients are treated in outpatient care, recurrence, antibiotic resistance, and failure of therapy impose a significant health burden [11]. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains a heavy burden, with prevalence of SSTI-associated in Asia ranging from 7.3% to 74% and similarly high elsewhere [12,13]. The emergence of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) has also made things challenging in both hospitals and communities [14]. SSTIs are more prevalent among men (60–70%) and occur most frequently in the 45–64-year age group [15], although rising hospitalization rates in younger adults indicate changing risk factors [16].
      In the face of mounting drug resistance and limitations of current treatments, novel approaches are gaining traction. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secretome of antimicrobial peptides and extracellular vesicles (EVs) have demonstrated promise with immunomodulatory and antimicrobial functions [17,18], notably against such pathogens as S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Clostridium perfringens [19]. EVs from MSCs, immune cells, bacteria, plants, and animals have bioactive cargo (miRNAs, proteins, lipids) to regulate inflammation, enhance tissue repair, and combat infection. Their direct application in SSTI treatment is yet to be fully investigated. This mini-review identifies the therapeutic use of MSC-derived and other biologically derived EVs for SSTI therapy, with emphasis on mechanisms of action, current evidence, and translational potential against antibiotic resistance. Figure 1 depicts global incidence trends, hospital burden, risk populations, and imperatives of antibiotic resistance and highlights emerging treatment platforms such as MSCs, EVs, and AMPs.
    
    
      2. Key Bacterial Pathogens in SSTIs
      SSTIs represent a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes and are caused by a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. Of these, the most frequently implicated are S. aureus and S. pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS), although the offending pathogen will generally differ based on infection, exposure, and host factors such as immune status and comorbid conditions.
      
        2.1. Streptococcus aureus
        S. aureus is the predominant and most common pathogen in SSTIs, presenting with conditions ranging from impetigo to necrotizing fasciitis and cellulitis [20,21]. Its ability to colonize the skin and mucosa, along with the predispositions offered by such conditions as diabetes or immunosuppression, may increase its occurrence. Of particular concern is methicillin-resistant S. aureus or MRSA, carrying the mecA gene that encodes PBP2a, which then confers beta-lactam resistance [22]. MRSA causes higher morbidities, treatment failures, and healthcare costs both in-community (CA-MRSA) and in-hospital (HA-MRSA) [23,24]. Treatment often consists of prolonged courses of antibiotics, and IV therapy and drug monitoring may be required in case of invasive infections [24]. Both MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus express numerous virulence factors, including adhesions proteins (fibronectin-binding proteins, EbpS, ClfA/B), the ability to form biofilms, immune evasion mechanisms (Protein A and capsular polysaccharides), and tissue-destructive toxins (α-toxin) [25,26,27,28,29,30,31]. CA-MRSA strains, such as USA300, often carry Panton–Valentine leukocidin (PVL), linked to tissue necrosis, and show hyperactive agr quorum-sensing systems that enhance toxin production [32,33,34]. Additional virulence and resistance genes carried on mobile genetic elements such as staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) and arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), aside from causing antibiotic resistance, enhance bacterial colonization, persistence, and virulence [35]. Wall teichoic acids and, in some strains, TSST-1 further amplify the pathogenicity of MRSA [36,37]. While MRSA is more often linked with adverse outcomes, some MSSA strains, such as ST398, are also highly virulent [38]. Clinical studies suggest higher morbidity and mortality with MRSA due to resistance and virulence synergy, though experimental data on relative virulence remains mixed, with strain variability and host factors playing significant roles [39,40,41]. Empirical treatment often includes clindamycin, doxycycline, TMP-SMX, or vancomycin depending on resistance and severity.
      
      
        2.2. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes)
        Streptococcus pyogenes is a key cause of SSTIs, particularly cellulitis and erysipelas. Cellulitis affects deeper, subcutaneous tissues, while erysipelas is more superficial, involving the upper dermis and lymphatics and leading to severe conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) [42,43]. Both present with redness, heat, and swelling, and erysipelas especially shows raised, well-defined borders. It can progress rapidly and often involves lymphatic streaking [42]. Meanwhile, noninvasive infections such as pharyngitis, impetigo, and scarlet fever are typically localized and transmitted via respiratory droplets or direct contact [43]. Postinfectious sequelae, including rheumatic fever and APSGN, arise from autoimmune or immune complex-mediated responses occurring weeks after the initial infection [44]. S. pyogenes exhibits a wide range of clinical manifestations categorized by infection type and serotype. Over 80 M protein serotypes determine strain-specific virulence, with Class I strains linked to rheumatic fever and Class II strains associated with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) [45,46]. The M protein is a key virulence factor that aids in immune evasion by inhibiting phagocytosis and forms the basis for strain typing [47]. It invades tissues rapidly through various virulence factors, including M protein, which inhibits phagocytosis; streptolysins and hyaluronidase, which promote tissue degradation; and superantigens, which trigger excessive immune activation [48]. Other key virulence factors include Streptolysin O (SLO), an oxygen-labile, immunogenic cytotoxin that forms pores in host cell membranes, causing lysis of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. It also induces production of anti-streptolysin O antibodies (ASO), used diagnostically. Meanwhile, streptolysin S (SLS) is an oxygen-stable, nonimmunogenic cytotoxin responsible for beta-hemolysis on blood agar and cytotoxic to host cells [49]. Pyrogenic exotoxins (SpeA, SpeB, SpeC) are superantigens that induce cytokine storms in diseases such as scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome; SpeB also has a role as a protease that breaks down host tissue [50]. Furthermore, streptokinase converts plasminogen to plasmin, which promotes fibrin degradation and bacterial spread [51]. Hyaluronidase and DNases also facilitate tissue invasion and NET evasion by degrading connective tissue and extracellular DNA, respectively [52]. Protein F and lipoteichoic acid enhance adherence to epithelial cells, enabling colonization, and C5a peptidase prevents neutrophil recruitment by degrading C5a [53]. Additional proteases, amylases, and esterases are involved in immune modulation, tissue destruction, and systemic dissemination, making S. pyogenes a highly versatile and invasive pathogen [54]. Treatment of severe infections involves high-dose intravenous penicillin in combination with clindamycin to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis and reduce toxin production.
      
      
        2.3. Clostridium perfringens
        Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic, spore-forming, Gram-positive bacillus that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of life-threatening soft tissue infection, primarily gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis) [55]. The bacterium frequently infects contaminated deep wounds, as in traumatic injury, crush injury, and surgical wounds, in which anaerobic conditions promote bacterial multiplication and spore germination [56]. The harm caused by C. perfringens is largely attributed to its powerful exotoxins, especially alpha-toxin (lecithinase), which disrupts cell membranes through phospholipid hydrolysis, causing extensive tissue necrosis, hemolysis, and vascular leakage [57]. Another major toxin, theta-toxin (perfringolysin O), forms pores in host cell membranes and causes vascular damage, myocardial depression, and circulatory collapse, contributing to systemic toxicity [58]. Treatment requires prompt and aggressive surgical debridement to remove necrotic tissue, along with high-dose intravenous penicillin to suppress bacterial growth [59]. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is often employed as an adjunct therapy, utilizing the oxygen-dependent metabolism of anaerobic bacteria to inhibit growth and enhance healing [60]. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are essential to maximizing results in clostridial infection patients.
      
      
        2.4. Others
        While S. aureus and GAS dominate the SSTI realm, there are other pathogens with significant roles under specific clinical conditions. Gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Aeromonas hydrophila are significant pathogens of SSTIs after exposure to freshwater. P. aeruginosa is endemic in water sources such as pools and hot tubs and can lead to folliculitis, wound infections, and severe burn wound infections with blue-green discharge and drug resistance due to biofilm production [61]. E. coli, especially pathogenic species such as O157:H7, can have the potential to cause SSTIs in contaminated freshwater systems, though more notoriously for gastrointestinal infection [62]. A. hydrophila, which is a common inhabitant of freshwater and brackish environments, is a causative agent of a spectrum of SSTIs, from cellulitis to necrotizing fasciitis, predominantly in water-exposed wounds. It secretes tissue-degrading enzymes and possesses increasing multidrug resistance and is thus an emerging pathogen in burn and trauma infections [63].
        Pathogens of animal bites such as Pasteurella multocida (most commonly from cats), Pasteurella canis and Capnocytophaga canimorsus (from dogs), and Eikenella corrodens (from human bites) can potentially produce rapidly progressing infections that extend from localized injuries to full-blown systemic disease [64]. C. canimorsus, a Gram-negative rod found in the oral flora of dogs and cats, typically produces symptoms 3 to 5 days after a bite or scratch [65]. Infection can promptly progress from nonsignificant local symptoms (swelling, erythema, blisters, pain, purulence) to systemic infection, sepsis, and potentially death, most notably in hosts who are immunocompromised such as asplenic individuals or those who have liver disease [66]. It may cause fulminant septicemia with shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple organ failure. Meningitis and severe sepsis are also seen in immunocompetent individuals [67]. Prompt wound cleansing in the initial stages and prompt antibiotic treatment (penicillin G or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations) are key to prevention. Pasteurella multocida, transmitted primarily through cat bites, is infamous for inducing spreading soft tissue infections with swelling, erythema, and pain within 24 h of the bite. It can produce cellulitis, abscess, and systemic infection if not treated [68]. Pasteurella canis and Capnocytophaga canimorsus in dog bites also cause rapidly progressing infections with the potential for systemic dissemination [69]. E. corrodens, a human oral flora organism, is implicated in human bite wounds and clenched fist injury. It causes virulent soft tissue infections that can progress rapidly without intervention [70].
        Vibrio vulnificus and Mycobacterium marinum are notable sea- and freshwater-borne pathogens that cause serious SSTIs, mostly in immunocompromised individuals [71,72]. V. vulnificus, a bacterium found in warm seawater, causes progressing wound infections and necrotizing fasciitis, typically acquired by exposure of an open wound or raw seafood ingestion [71]. It is highly fatal and requires immediate antibiotic treatment and surgery. M. marinum, present in aquarium water, causes chronic localized infection such as “fish tank granuloma” following trivial trauma to the skin [72]. It requires a prolonged course of antibiotic treatment and sometimes surgery. Prevention is by avoiding contact with infected water and wound care [73]. Table 1 shows the major bacterial pathogens responsible for SSTIs, including the common types of infections they cause, their principal virulence factors, known resistance mechanisms or notable strains, and key treatment considerations.
      
    
    
      3. Epidemiological Evidence of Antibiotic Resistance in SSTIs
      Emergence of antimicrobial resistance in SSTIs is becoming a global concern with regional and organism-specific variations. MRSA is the major resistant pathogen, accounting for 44% of SSTIs in Uganda [74] and having risen in Gabon from 3% over an 11-year period to 20% [75]. MRSA isolates were 94% resistant in Taiwan towards erythromycin and clindamycin but susceptible towards linezolid, teicoplanin, and vancomycin [76]. While in Europe the prevalence of MRSA is below 1% in some countries [77], in some parts of South America, Asia and the US, it is more than 60%, and it may be greater than 50% in some African regions [78]. In Malaysia, MRSA constituted 19.4% of blood isolates of S. aureus from 41 hospitals [79]. In US emergency-department-related SSTI cases, MRSA accounted for 54.8% of cases [80], whereas 4.5% of shelter residents were found to be the 2006 prevalence [81].
      Resistance among Group A Streptococcus (GAS) to macrolides and lincosamides is also increasing, with erythromycin resistance reported as high as 90% and clindamycin resistance up to 50% in some regions [82,83]. This geographic variability hinders empirical therapy, particularly for those allergic to penicillin [84]. A study conducted in Kuala Lumpur reported 42.1% of surgical site infection isolates as MDROs [85]. Clostridium perfringens shows resistance to multiple drugs including tetracycline, lincomycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and cefotaxime [86]. Additionally, 61% of Gram-negative SSTI isolates were ESBL producers [87], and 27% showed carbapenem resistance [88]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains challenging due to intrinsic and acquired resistance [89], while multidrug-resistant Aeromonas hydrophila strains have been found in both clinical and environmental settings, suggesting possible transmission routes [90]. These trends underscore the need for continuous surveillance, tailored empirical treatment, infection control, and antimicrobial stewardship to address the rising threat of resistance in SSTIs.
    
    
      4. Current Treatment for SSTIs
      Accurate diagnosis, early treatment, and stratified management based on the type and severity of the infection are the cornerstones for the treatment of SSTIs. Diagnosis is mainly clinical, based on signs such as erythema, edema, pain, pus drainage, and systemic signs of fever, which suggest a serious infection [91]. Wound cultures should be performed so as to steer antibiotic therapy. A 5-day course of antibiotic therapy is usually indicated for simple infections and may be extended if the patient is slow to respond [92]. Supportive care such as limb elevation, wound care, and hygiene education must also be given [93]. Other than abscesses, purulent SSTIs are usually treated with incision and drainage, while reserving antibiotics for patients presenting systemic symptoms, or those with immunosuppression or in cases of treatment failure [94]. Empiric oral options include TMP-SMX, doxycycline, or clindamycin; IV options include vancomycin or linezolid. Nonpurulent SSTIs (cellulitis) are mostly caused by streptococci and MSSA and are treated preferably with cephalexin or IV cefazolin; vancomycin is used if an MRSA infection is suspected or if there are allergies against beta-lactams [95]. Necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical emergency in which immediate debridement should be performed along with the institution of empiric IV broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin plus cefepime, or piperacillin-tazobactam) [96]. Clindamycin or linezolid may also be given for toxin suppression [97]. Animal bites are usually treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate, or doxycycline for those allergic to penicillin. Mild folliculitis can be managed with topical therapies, whereas extensive folliculitis might require systemic treatment [98]. Recurrence can be reduced by follow-up in 48 to 72 h, adjusting antibiotics as guided by culture, and addressing risk factors [99].
      With recent treatment advances, outcomes have improved, especially in resistant, toxin-producing, and polymicrobial infections. Newer agents such as delafloxacin and omadacycline span broad coverage, including MRSA and some ESBL-producers [100]. In addition, long-acting lipoglycopeptides, namely dalbavancin and oritavancin, allow for a once-weekly dosing schedule, rendering these drugs potentially viable candidates for outpatient treatment of SSTIs [101]; however, their exact role in the management of severe SSTIs still needs to be well elucidated. Clindamycin, linezolid, and tedizolid (a next-generation oxazolidinone with less side effects) remain important for toxin suppression in TS [102,103]. Empiric combination regimens, especially a combination of a broad-spectrum β-lactam (piperacillin–tazobactam or cefepime) with a toxin-suppression agent such as clindamycin or linezolid, are increasingly being employed for necrotizing SSTIs and have shown improved outcomes [104].
      Adjunctive therapies such as IVIG may possibly work against streptococcal toxic shock by neutralizing superantigens [105], whereas HBOT could be beneficial for necrotizing infections but should never delay definitive treatment [106]. Treatment options now focus prominently on PK/PD-based antibiotic dosing to maximize penetration into tissues with poor perfusion, with prolonged or continuous infusion of β-lactams and serum-level monitoring of drugs such as vancomycin being a good example in achieving high efficacy and low toxicity [107,108]. In parallel, regenerative strategies include the use of MSCs and their EVs. MSCs carry out immunomodulatory and tissue-repair functions, mainly being useful in chronic or ischemic SSTIs. In addition, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles deliver miRNAs, cytokines, and growth factors to injured tissues, which favor repair processes sans any risks connected with live cell therapies. Although this is mostly proof-of-concept and preclinical, these early translational studies imply that MSCs and EVs could become adjunctive therapies for complex drug-resistant SSTIs in the near future. Table 2 summarizes the clinical management strategies for various types of SSTIs, including first-line antimicrobial treatments, adjunctive therapies, and recent advances in pharmacological and regenerative approaches.
    
    
      5. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)
      EVs are cell-secreted, membrane-bound nanoparticles from nearly all cell types. Based on their cell origin, size, and biogenesis, EVs are broadly classified into small EVs (sEVs) and large EVs (lEVs) [109]. An understanding of how they are generated and how they choose their cargo is essential in determining their physiological and pathological functions, e.g., immunity, infection, and oncogenesis [110]. Exosomes or sEVs are small vesicles measuring 30–150 nm derived from the endosomal pathway. Exosome biogenesis begins with inward budding of the early endosomal limiting membrane, which creates MVBs that can either fuse with lysosomes to break down the cargo or fuse with the plasma membrane and expel intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) as exosomes into the exterior space [111,112]. Exosome formation occurs by two main routes: the ESCRT-dependent mechanism, where ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III complexes and core components such as TSG101 (ESCRT-I) and ALIX (ESCRT-III accessory protein) act sequentially to direct membrane budding and sorting of cargo; and the ESCRT-independent mechanism, which relies upon lipid raft domains and tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), where tetraspanins including CD9, CD63, and CD81 facilitate vesicle formation and cargo selection [113]. Regulatory proteins such as Rab GTPases (e.g., RAB27a/b, RAB11) regulate MVB trafficking and docking, whereas membrane fusion is regulated by SNARE proteins to allow exosome release [114]. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is also involved in the membrane dynamics and maturation of MVB. Exosomes are often identified by some molecular markers such as tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, CD81), ESCRT-related proteins (ALIX, TSG101), and other markers such as flotillin, HSP70, and HSP90 [115,116].
      lEVs, otherwise referred to as microvesicles or ectosomes, measure approximately 100 to 1000 nm in diameter, but some subpopulations such as large oncosomes measure more than 1 µm in diameter [117]. In contrast to small EVs (exosomes) of the endosomal route, lEVs are created through direct plasma membrane outward budding, and fission and MVBs do not play a role in their biogenesis. lEV production is typically evoked by a rise in intracellular calcium leading to cell membrane phospholipid asymmetry disruption and activation of flippases, floppases, and scramblases to induce membrane curvature [118]. Concurrently, calcium entry facilitates cytoskeleton remodeling via actin filament reorganization that enhances cell membrane protrusion and vesicle shedding. Small GTPases such as ARF6 and members of the Rho family are implicated in membrane traffic, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and selective cargo loading [119]. Microvesicle formation is generally not dependent on ESCRT machinery, although some ESCRT components may be implicated under specific conditions. Molecular lEV markers include Annexin A1, which in a calcium-dependent manner is a phospholipid binder and contributes to membrane curvature; ARF6, which controls cytoskeletal dynamics; and integrins, particularly in microvesicles from invasive or migrating cells [120]. The heterogenous lEV cargo is typically enriched with ribosomal proteins, factors involved in RNA processing, cytosolic enzymes, and signaling molecules and associated with inflammation, coagulation, cellular stress response, and cancer growth [121]. Table 3 shows the comparison of different types of EVs. Figure 2 shows the biogenesis and release of EVs.
      
        5.1. EVs in Promoting SSTIs
        In SSTIs, EVs are archetypal characters involved in infection dynamics, immune modulation, and inflammation of tissue. They carry a heterogeneous cargo of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which enable them to affect both host defense mechanisms and pathogen virulence processes [122]. In bacterial SSTIs, S. aureus releases cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (CMVs), also known as S. aureus-derived EVs (SA-EVs), and are loaded with virulence factors such as α-hemolysin, proteases, β-lactamases, and nucleic acids. These vesicles can traverse the epidermal barrier, activate keratinocytes, and initiate inflammatory cascades by cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, compromising the integrity of the skin and exacerbating infections such as impetigo and atopic dermatitis (AD) [123]. SA-EV secretion is induced in response to environmental stressors such as ultraviolet (UV) light and certain antibiotics, enhancing infection severity [124,125]. SA-EVs also contribute to AD by promoting antibiotic resistance through beta-lactamase delivery, disrupting the epidermal barrier via alpha-hemolysin and protein A, and inducing inflammation [126]. CMVs also mediate antibiotic resistance by transferring β-lactamases, disrupt the epidermal barrier via α-hemolysin and protein A, and promote inflammatory responses [127]. CMVs are also capable of regulating immune responses by inducing proinflammatory cytokines (CXCL8, TNF-α), neutrophil recruitment, and immune cell infiltration, both promoting pathogen clearance and tissue damage [128]. CMVs also enable intercellular communication between S. aureus populations to enable coordinated expression of the resistance and virulence genes [129].
        SA-EVs are also responsible for biofilm formation through enhanced hydrophilicity of the skin surface, enhanced bacterial colonization, and shielding of the pathogen against host immune systems. This biofilm-forming activity is the cause of chronic and recurring infections [130]. In chronic wounds, particularly polymicrobial biofilms such as diabetic foot ulcers, EVs from S. aureus and P. aeruginosa deliver quorum-sensing molecules and extracellular matrix components that reinforce biofilm maturation, modulate immune responses, and promote antibiotic resistance [131]. These mechanisms collectively delay wound healing and perpetuate infection chronicity, highlighting the critical role of bacterial EVs in SSTI pathogenesis and persistence. Membrane vesicles (MVs) carry proteins such as Staphylococcal protein A (SpA), which binds host IgG and blocks complement activation, helping bacteria evade immune clearance. They also induce proinflammatory cytokines via activation of innate immune receptors (TLR2), which can paradoxically contribute to tissue damage and facilitate bacterial spread [132]. The similar MVs also enable the transport of the various factors, such as ferritin and lipoproteins, responsible for iron acquisition. Iron is limited in hosts and is essential for bacterial growth [133].
        In addition, Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) facilitate tissue invasion during infections via several mechanisms based on delivering their virulence factors to host cells, activating host immune responses and aiding in the colonization and dissemination of bacteria [134]. OMVs are filled with numerous virulence factors, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), outer membrane proteins (OmpA), toxins (Shiga toxin and cholera toxin), enzymes, and small RNAs that are all delivered directly to host cells that can damage tissues, disrupt boundaries, and allow the bacteria to potentially invade deeper tissues without direct contact with the host cells [135]. OMVs from pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori and Porphyromonas gingivalis can both degrade mucin layer and tight junction proteins in epithelial cells, disrupting the physical barrier to promote colonization and invasion of tissues [136]. OMV-associated components such as LPS and outer membrane proteins activate pathogenic-associated pattern recognition receptors (TLR4), leading to the activation of signaling pathways (NF-κB, MAPK) that induce, for example, proinflammatory cytokines, promote activation of the inflammasome, and trigger pyroptosis. Inflammation can lead to damage to host tissues, promote vascular permeability, and provide an opportunity for bacteria to spread deep in tissues [137]. OMVs can modulate immune responses to the advantage of bacteria through delivery of factors that may lead to inhibition of immune clearance or even apoptosis of immune cells. An example of this is Neisseria gonorrhoeae OMVs that carry PorB protein to macrophage mitochondria, leading to apoptosis and therefore loss of immune function [138]. OMVs also carry factors associated with adhesion (Ail protein in E. coli; Ipa proteins in Shigella flexneri) and facilitate invasion [139,140]. OMVs can contribute to the formation of the biofilm matrix that can also facilitate persistence in tissues and provide resistance to host defenses and antibiotics [141].
        Fungal pathogens, including Malassezia sympodialis, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans, also release EVs [142]. For example, EVs from M. sympodialis contain allergens such as Mala s1 and s5–13, as well as nucleic acids that promote Th2-type allergic inflammation by inducing IL-4 and ICAM-1 expression in keratinocytes, thereby worsening diseases such as atopic dermatitis [143]. Lysophospholipase in EVs degrades sebaceous lipids, releasing irritating fatty acids that disrupt barrier integrity and increase permeability resulting skin barrier degradation [144]. A study demonstrated that EVs from Candida albicans play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SSTIs by carrying bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, enzymes, and RNAs, which promote biofilm formation, deliver virulence factors, and influence host cell behaviors such as proliferation and collagen deposition, potentially impairing wound healing [145]. Specifically, EVs stimulate cytokine production (IL-6, IL-4, IL-12, IL-10, TGF-β, TNF-α), contributing to local inflammation. During biofilm development, EVs enrich the extracellular matrix, shielding the fungus from antifungal agents and mediating drug resistance. This is evident in ESCRT-deficient mutants, where reduced EV release increases drug susceptibility [146]. Cryptococcus neoformans-EVs play a significant role in SSTIs by transferring virulence factors that guarantee fungal survival and host invasion. Vesicles interact with immune cells, particularly macrophages, which alter host responses and exacerbate inflammation. EVs can also guarantee fungal dissemination by impacting the host’s immune signaling. Experiments have shown that EVs impact fungal biology and host–pathogen interaction, resulting in skin lesions in cutaneous cryptococcosis [147]. Table 4 organizes the pathogenic roles of microbial EVs in SSTIs.
      
      
        5.2. EVs in Supressing SSTIs
        EVs play a pivotal role in modulating SSTI suppression because they have the dual capability to modulate immune response as well as stimulate tissue regeneration. Released by numerous cell types such as keratinocytes, immune cells, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and MSCs, as well as bacterial, plant, and animal cells, these nanoscale, membrane-bound vesicles harbor bioactive cargos such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs that allow them to modulate multiple biological processes that are essential for SSTI resolution [148,149].
        EVs derived from cells inhabiting the skin such as keratinocytes play a role in innate immune activation by regulating the functions of macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils. For instance, keratinocyte-derived EVs can carry immunoregulatory molecules such as anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), microRNAs (miR-146a, miR-21), and suppressive proteins that modulate the activation state of immune cells. These EVs can interact with macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells to dampen proinflammatory responses, especially after the resolution of an infection or during wound healing [150]. Keratinocyte-derived EVs also deliver AMPs, such as β-defensin 2 and S100A12, as well as chemoattractants including CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, and CXCL6, which contribute to immune cell recruitment, with broad-spectrum activity and direct antibacterial action on bacteria such as S. aureus [151].
        Keratinocyte-derived EVs also control local immunity by carrying cytokines and microRNAs that control inflammation, suppressing excessive immune activation while maintaining effective antimicrobial defense. Moreover, KC-EVs enhance skin barrier function by promoting keratinocyte proliferation and migration for re-epithelialization and restoration of barrier integrity after infection-induced tissue damage [152]. Keratinocytes stimulated with S. aureus enterotoxin B release EVs containing MHC molecules capable of enhancing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation, suggesting an immunostimulatory role in cutaneous defense [153]. A study also demonstrated that keratinocyte EVs have been shown to influence macrophage polarization, promoting a shift from the proinflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. M2 macrophages secrete IL-10 and TGF-β, which are critical for tissue repair, extracellular matrix remodeling, and suppression of immune overactivation. This transition is essential for preventing chronic inflammation and facilitating skin regeneration after injury [154]. Keratinocyte-derived EVs contain human β-defensin 3, which influences immune cell behavior, including macrophage polarization and dendritic cell activation. These vesicles not only inhibit microbial growth by directly targeting pathogens but modulate inflammatory signaling to limit tissue damage [155]. Furthermore, keratinocyte EVs facilitate intercellular communication essential for wound healing by promoting keratinocyte proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Keratinocyte-EVs are involved in skin homeostasis and wound healing and pigmentation. They carry proteolytic enzymes, such as cathepsin B and matrix metalloproteinase-1, and TGF-binding proteins, which activate fibroblasts to remodel the extracellular matrix and promote keratinocyte migration [156].
        Notably, fibroblast-EVs are an extremely heterogeneous cell population, the functional modes of which are regulated by the biological properties of the donor fibroblasts and the microenvironment. This heterogeneity is a reflection of the inherent diversity of fibroblast subtypes in different anatomical locations, and their ability to adapt dynamically to physiological and pathological stimuli, including infection, inflammation, and tissue injury [157]. Fibroblast-EVs enhance keratinocyte migration and protect against oxidative stress, underscoring their role in skin homeostasis and repair. Importantly, fibroblast-EVs from scleroderma patients exhibit dysregulated collagen-related miRNAs that enhance fibrotic responses, suggesting a contribution to disease pathogenesis [158]. For example, in the presence of SSTIs, PAMPs and proinflammatory cytokines can modulate fibroblast activity, leading to the release of EVs with modified cargo that may exacerbate or resolve inflammation. These infection-altered EVs could affect processes such as wound healing, immune cell recruitment, and matrix remodeling, ultimately impacting tissue regeneration and disease progression [159].
        Adipocyte-derived EVs have been reported to modulate inflammatory responses by managing cytokine release and the activation of immune cells. Vesicles have been reported to suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and promote the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. This immunomodulation is required in the process of suppressing collateral tissue damage and promoting a regulated healing response [160]. It can strengthen the host’s resistance to infection-related tissue deterioration. The indirect antimicrobial benefits of restoring vascularization, improving barrier function, and suppressing excessive inflammation are crucial in managing SSTIs and preventing chronic wound formation. Notably, adipose-derived stem cell EVs have been found to inhibit inflammatory mediator production and release, suggesting a therapeutic application in decreasing overactive or chronic inflammation in SSTIs [161] whereby adipose-derived stem cells EVs indeed stimulate ECM remodeling by modulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and deposition of collagen, critical processes for effective wound healing. These regenerative properties make Ad-EVs good candidates for wound therapy complicated by infection, ischemia, or diabetes [162].
        MSC-EVs are a new and hopeful approach to treating SSTIs that offer a cell-free therapeutic agent with a blend of regenerative, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial functions. MSC-EVs are nanoscale extracellular vesicles secreted by MSCs and are extensively loaded with bioactive molecules, including microRNAs, proteins, and lipids. These vesicles replicate most of MSC’s therapeutic actions but with stability, storage, and safety advantages, thus becoming a potential substitute for live-cell therapies [163]. Perhaps the most significant manner in which MSC-EVs exert their therapeutic activity in SSTIs is through immunomodulation by promoting macrophage polarization from a proinflammatory M1 type to an anti-inflammatory and tissue-healing M2 type [164]. This modulation, mediated predominantly by microRNAs miR-21 and miR-223, results in suppression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, thereby establishing a wound-healing environment for tissue regeneration [165]. MSC-EVs further directly induce proliferation and migration of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes leading to skin repair cell types and hence driving wound closure and re-epithelialization. They also assist in reducing the development of scars by regulating expression of collagen subtypes and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β isoforms, namely increasing type III collagen and TGF-β3 but inhibiting type I collagen and TGF-β1, the combined effect of which is antifibrotic and anti-scar tissue formation [166]. EVs also interact with key pathways such as Wnt that orchestrate wound healing and tissue remodeling. In addition, MSC-EVs play a key role in promoting angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling, which are essential events for healing the structural and functional integrity of the skin [167]. In preclinical in vivo models, particularly murine models, the therapeutic efficacy of locally administered MSC-EVs has consistently demonstrated the capacity to accelerate wound healing processes, including enhanced re-epithelialization, reduced scar width, and improved overall skin architecture [168]. Cumulatively, the combined therapeutic actions of MSCs and their EVs in SSTIs are multifaceted. MSCs act directly to improve tissue healing and immune response, while MSC-EVs provide a cell-free, yet effective, modality that heals by activating many molecular and cellular mechanisms. These findings identify the potential of MSC-EVs as an emerging treatment modality for wound infection control and patient outcome improvement in SSTIs, which necessitates further translational studies and clinical trials.
        Dendritic-cell-released EVs (DC-EVs) have complementary functions during soft and dermal tissue infections. Although traditionally recognized for their role in antigen presentation and immune surveillance, DC-EVs are now appreciated for their contribution to tissue repair processes, especially in the context of skin and soft tissue injuries [169,170]. It is likely that the most significant contribution of DC-EVs to wound healing involves the recruitment of MSCs to the wound site. DC-EVs naturally encapsulate and carry chemoattractant molecules such as osteopontin (OPN) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Such molecules create a chemotactic gradient that signals MSCs to migrate to the site of the wound [171]. MSCs are very important in wound healing because of their immunomodulatory capacity, secretion of proregenerative factors, and ability to enhance angiogenesis and tissue remodeling. Significantly, the effect of DC-EVs on MSC migration is dose-dependent, suggesting a tightly regulated mechanism by which increasing doses of EVs can increasingly enhance MSC recruitment. While the DC-EVs themselves appear not to directly influence MSC proliferation or differentiation, their ability to direct MSC homing toward damaged tissue is a crucial stepping stone for coordination of the initial stages of wound repair [172]. While the primary evidence is in their chemoattractant function, DC-EVs are also anticipated to play roles in controlling the immune microenvironment of the injury. Immune modulators such as DCs can produce EVs containing anti-inflammatory mediators or propolarizing mediators that provoke macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype, with a function in the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair. Although more direct studies of DC-EVs here are required, it is possible to draw analogies from EVs of other immune cells, which are known to influence macrophage function and wound healing [173].
        B cell-, T cell-, and macrophage-derived EVs play a significant role in immune modulation, inflammation, and repair of tissue. B cell-EVs are filled with MHC-I/II, CD20, and immune-regulatory proteins and can be stimulated by CD40, IL-4, or BCR activation to enhance EV release. These EVs can carry miRNA cargos (miR-155) and induce CD4+ T cell apoptosis, though their role in skin diseases such as bullous pemphigoid (BP) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains underexplored [174]. T cell-EVs contain TCR, CD3, FasL, and subset-specific miRNAs, which affect DC maturation, NK inhibition, B cell activation, and cytokine secretion; for instance, Treg-EVs suppress Th1 function, while CD8+ T cell-EVs induce tumor stroma apoptosis [175]. Macrophage-EVs are of the M1/M2 phenotype and rich in cytokines, Wnt proteins, and cholesterol and control recipient cell function and inflammation. Though they cause inflammation during chronic diseases, macrophage-EVs also promote healing of diabetic wounds by suppressing proinflammatory mediators. Overall, immune cell-derived EVs are emerging as major regulators of immunity and future therapeutic agents in inflammation, cancer, and skin regeneration [176].
        Neutrophil EVs play pivotal roles in innate immune reactions, inflammation, and tissue repair [177]. EVs, which are loaded with antimicrobial proteins, granule enzymes, and surface receptors, are increased in sepsis and inflammation and possess pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. They inhibit microbial growth, modulate platelet–neutrophil interaction, and initiate macrophage autophagy for enhanced pathogen elimination. Neutrophil-EVs can exacerbate inflammation by activating endothelial cells, breaking down extracellular matrix, and triggering keratinocytes in psoriasis or exert anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing cytokine production in NK cells, DCs, and macrophages, as seen in gout and cartilage protection [178]. They also regulate endothelial permeability and vascular remodeling: some EV cargos (S100A8/A9, MPO) undermine barrier integrity, while others (annexin 1) preserve it [155,156]. Because of their dual role, neutrophil-EVs are emerging as important regulators in inflammatory skin diseases, which must be investigated further [179].
        Endothelial-progenitor-cell-derived (EPC-EVs) are found to be effective wound healing mediators, particularly of diabetic wounds. EPC-EVs induce angiogenesis by promoting enhanced endothelial cell growth, migration, and tube formation, as seen in in vitro and in vivo models [180]. EPC-EVs promote the viability of epidermal cells such as HaCaT keratinocytes by triggering their proliferation, migration, adhesion, and survival even in high-glucose conditions. Mechanistically, EPC-EVs carry microRNAs such as miR-182-5p and miR-221-3p, which regulate tissue repair genes (miR-182-5p) inhibits PPARG for enhanced epidermal cell activity [181]. Moreover, EPC-EVs activate prominent signaling pathways such as Erk1/2 and RAF/ERK, which play a vital role in angiogenesis and tissue repair [182]. EPC-EVs also influence the level of extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, MMPs) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8), thereby creating an appropriate microenvironment for wound healing [183]. EPC-EVs have been locally applied in diabetic mouse models to accelerate wound healing, improve collagen alignment, reduce scar formation, and enhance neovascularization. These multifaceted effects render EPC-EVs a cell-free therapeutic candidate for augmenting healing processes in diabetic, chronic, nonhealing wounds [184].
        CMVs from Gram-positive bacteria help regulate soft tissue infections through a variety of mechanisms primarily involving regulation of the host immune response, engaging both innate and adaptive immunity, and facilitating bacterial–host interactions that can affect infection outcomes. CMVs may also stimulate innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells through pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). For example, S. aureus CMVs activate macrophages via TLR2, leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, which are essential for facilitating the innate immune response to infection [185]. CMVs derived from S. pneumoniae stimulate immune signaling though NF-κB in macrophages, which increases recruitment of immune cells and inflammatory signaling, contributing to the containment of infection [186]. CMVs derived from Listeria monocytogenes can also internalized in nonphagocytic pathways, resulting in autophagic and lysosomal pathways that contribute to the clearance of the pathogen [187]. Meanwhile, CMVs from Bacillus anthracis elicit robust IgM responses against toxin components from SSTIs, enhancing survival in infection models [188]. A study on OMVs from the gut commensal Parabacteroides goldsteinii (Pg OMVs) demonstrated that orally administered Pg OMVs can reach inflamed skin via the gut–skin axis and significantly reduce skin inflammation in psoriasis-like mouse models [189]. These OMVs suppressed epidermal hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration in skin lesions, effectively ameliorating skin and systemic inflammation. Local subcutaneous delivery of Pg OMVs also yielded similar immunosuppressive effects, suggesting their potential as a therapeutic agent for inflammatory skin diseases. OMVs from commensal gut bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis have been shown to promote the maturation of the immune system and enhance regulatory T cell activation, leading to increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production and prevention of inflammatory disease [190]. A study also explored EVs of S. aureus, Enterococcus spp., and Lactobacillus strains and found them to be protective against HIV-1 infection by virus–cell receptor blocking via steric hindrance and protein receptor shielding. While the study focused on mucosal environments such as the vaginal epithelium, the findings suggest that similar mechanisms may be applicable in skin tissues, where these EVs could contribute to barrier formation and immune modulation. Their ability to inhibit HIV-1 infection underlines a broader immune-protective function, supporting the potential of Gram-positive bacterial EVs as natural immunomodulators in both mucosal and cutaneous contexts [191]. Figure 3 compares the key features of bacterial extracellular vesicles derived from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
        Although certain strains of Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) are already known to be causative of inflammatory acne, recent studies show that EVs of certain phylotypes may have opposite, beneficial effects. Notably, extracellular vesicles of SLST H1 phylotype possess intense anti-inflammatory capacity and intense sebum production inhibition capability on in vitro skin models, as reported by Pol Cros et al. [192], which provides promising leads towards microbiome-directed therapies for acne and associated skin diseases. Likewise, Staphylococcus epidermidis EVs, a constituent of the commensal skin microbiota, have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in AD in re-establishing skin homeostasis. They have immunomodulatory activity by stimulating antimicrobial peptides human β-defensins 2 and 3 and suppress the growth of S. aureus, a key accelerator of AD. The vesicles modulate inflammatory gene expression, stimulate cell proliferation and migration, and enhance skin barrier integrity. Together, these behaviors reduce inflammation and induce a healthier and protective skin state [193]. Moreover, EVs from Lactobacillus plantarum were reported to enhance anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization, reversing the proinflammatory function of S. aureus EVs in AD [194], also bearing witness to the application of such vesicles in treating hyperinflammatory dermatoses such as eczema. Moreover, S. epidermidis EVs (str. ATCC12228) inhibited psoriasis-like inflammation through the induction of interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra), once more affirming the diverse and optimistic roles of bacterial EVs in the modulation of skin inflammation, as reported by Gómez-Chávez et al. (2021) [195].
        The medical field recognizes plant-derived EVs as potential therapeutic agents for SSTIs [196]. Biocompatible plant-derived nanovesicles contain different therapeutic components such as proteins and lipids along with RNAs and small metabolites, which demonstrate their therapeutic value. The natural stability and biocompatibility of plant-derived EVs make them valuable for both antimicrobial therapy and wound repair because they can interact with mammalian systems [197]. The antimicrobial nature of plant-derived EVs shows their effectiveness against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Through the use of mint-leaf-derived nanovesicles in hydrogels (MENV-HG) researchers confirmed their powerful antibacterial effects. The application of these hydrogels on infected skin models produced 99% healing within 10 days while significantly reducing local inflammation [198]. Dandelion-derived vesicle-like nanoparticles (TH-EVNs) block the harmful effects of S. aureus exotoxins. The nanoparticles work to repair wounds through their ability to stimulate keratinocyte proliferation and migration which drive essential skin regeneration processes [199]. In addition to antimicrobial activity, plant-derived EVs promote wound healing actively by modulating various phases of tissue regeneration. The regenerative function of PDVs functions through the four classical phases of wound healing: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Grapefruit-derived EVs (GEVs), for instance, are reported to promote keratinocyte proliferation and migration, increase angiogenesis, and decrease oxidative stress, all essential for efficient wound repair [200]. A novel study showed that exosomes from Flos sophorae immaturus encapsulated in hydrogel improved spinal cord injury recovery by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress [201]. EVs purified from Opuntia ficus-indica fruit (OFI-EVs) may also play a therapeutic role. OFI-EVs were not toxic, and they could reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in vitro. They inhibited proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells and stimulated the migration of fibroblasts, which reflected their activity in wound healing and made their use in treating chronic skin wounds valid [202]. Carrot-derived EVs were also found to induce IL-10 and Nrf2 activation to inhibit inflammation [203]; similarly, lemon-derived nanovesicles reduced ROS levels induced by H2O2 and UVB exposure by activating the AhR/Nrf2 pathway in dermal fibroblast cells [204].
        Animal-derived EVs are a promising class of bioactive nanocarriers for the improvement of wound healing. Bovine colostrum, the highly nutritious early milk secreted following parturition, is a potent source of regenerative factors, and its EVs have also been found to be very useful in tissue repair [205]. Kim et al. (2021) showed that colostrum-derived EVs (Colos EVs) cause dermal fibroblast proliferation, endothelial tube formation, and keratinocyte migration, which are important processes involved in wound re-epithelialization and neovascularization. These EVs are loaded with growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines that provide support for healing from the inflammatory phase to the proliferative phase [206]. Bovine milk is another rich and cheap source of EVs with regenerative and immunomodulatory capacity. These vesicles carry high concentrations of microRNAs (e.g., miR-148a, miR-21), growth factors (e.g., TGF-β and VEGF), and bioactive lipids that facilitate keratinocyte migration and ECM remodeling [207,208]. Milk-derived EVs were shown to suppress overinflammation and stimulate dermal cell proliferation and migration, leading to enhanced restoration of the epithelial barrier and decreased scar tissue formation. Their biocompatibility and nonimmunogenic nature also qualify them for use as topically applied therapeutics in the management of acute and chronic wounds [208]. Platelet-derived EVs are a subset of EVs released during platelet activation and aggregation. These vesicles contain a library of growth factors, including PDGF, TGF-β, VEGF, and chemokines, which are produced by platelets, serving important roles in hemostasis and tissue repair [209,210]. Esmaeilzadeh et al. (2024) demonstrated that PEVs can stimulate fibroblast proliferation, enhance angiogenesis, and modulate immune cell recruitment, creating a proregenerative microenvironment [211]. Of particular note, in chronic wounds such as diabetic ulcers, PEVs inhibited local inflammation and supported increased granulation tissue formation and re-epithelialization. With their native hemostatic and regenerative capabilities, PEVs hold significant promise for acute and chronic wound healing.
        Overall, sEVs play an important role in communication between cells. They carry microRNAs, proteins, and lipids that can change how our immune system reacts, influencing things such as how our body handles inflammation and wound healing. For instance, they help shift macrophages from a proinflammatory state to a healing state, which is essential for repairing tissues. They also encourage the movement of skin cells and promote the growth of new blood vessels, making them key players in the healing process. Furthermore, because the contents of sEVs reflect the condition of their source cells, they can serve as valuable biomarkers for diagnosis. On the other hand, lEVs, particularly those from platelets and endothelial cells, tend to drive inflammation and promote clotting. They release substances that ramp up inflammation and help trigger the body’s clotting responses during serious infections. lEVs also present antigens and attract other immune cells, which helps track the source of these vesicles. Table 5 organizes the diverse roles of EVs in SSTI management, while Table 6 presents how different types of EVs contribute to SSTI management through immunomodulation, antimicrobial cargo delivery, and tissue repair.
      
    
    
      6. Clinical Translation and Future Directions
      The therapeutic application of EVs, particularly those derived from MSCs, immune cells, and plant sources, offers exciting potential for treating SSTIs. These vesicles exhibit regenerative, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial properties that could revolutionize the management of both acute and chronic SSTIs. However, clinical translation remains in its infancy, hampered by scientific, technical, and regulatory challenges that must be addressed for broader implementation.
      Several early-phase clinical trials (NCT05243368, NCT04652531, NCT04134676) have begun to evaluate the safety and feasibility of EV-based therapies in wound healing, particularly in chronic and diabetic ulcers [212,213]. These studies underscore the promise of EVs in tissue repair, yet widespread clinical adoption is limited because of difficulties in scalable manufacturing, cargo heterogeneity, batch consistency, and delivery optimization [214]. Regulatory bodies emphasize purity, identity, and safety in EV research and use, especially as the discipline heads towards clinical and industrial use. EV purity is important to eliminate contaminants that can cause side effects, and EV identity characterization—what are they and where they originate from—is important considering the broad variety of biological activities of EV subtypes [215,216]. Safety testing is also necessary to make EV preparations free from toxic entities, enabling patient and user safety. Furthermore, for EV-based products to be viable at scale, they must be produced consistently and reproducibly within tightly regulated parameters. To support these ambitions, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) has released the MISEV (Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles) guidelines that offer a foundation for improving study quality, reproducibility, and adherence to regulatory expectations in EV research [217,218].
      To bridge the gap between preclinical research and clinical application, several key priorities must be addressed. First, a deeper mechanistic understanding of EV biodistribution, uptake, and cell-specific interactions is essential. Second, standardized, GMP-compliant production and quality control protocols are needed to ensure reproducibility and safety. Third, engineering approaches that allow for targeted delivery such as surface modification and cargo loading must be optimized to enhance therapeutic precision [219,220].
      The integration of nanotechnology-derived delivery systems such as hydrogels, microneedle patches, and nanocomposites with EVs or exosomes, is a promising method for enhancing therapeutic delivery, diagnostics, and tissue engineering. These delivery vehicles exhibit controlled and sustained release, enhanced biocompatibility, and targeted localization of EVs, thereby harnessing the full therapeutic potential. Hydrogels establish a hydrated, biocompatible environment that protects EVs while facilitating dynamic release [221]; microneedle patches create a noninvasive route for transdermal EV administration [222]; and nanocomposites enhance stability, targeting, and responsiveness to stimuli [223]. This integration facilitates uses such as drug delivery to cancer, real-time disease diagnosis, and regenerative medicine in wound healing or tissue regeneration. Future progress can include the development of intelligent, stimulus-responsive delivery systems, personalized EV-based therapeutics with low immunogenicity, and multifunctional theragnostic platforms, positioning EV-based delivery systems at the forefront of next-generation biomedicine [224,225]. In parallel, EV integration with advanced delivery systems such as hydrogels, microneedle patches, or nanocomposites could improve retention at wound sites and allow for controlled, localized release. Safety profiling remains another critical area, particularly regarding immunogenicity and the long-term effects of repeated administration in humans [226].
      Looking ahead, well-designed, multicenter randomized controlled trials are crucial to validate EV-based therapies for SSTIs. Furthermore, EVs may evolve into theragnostic tools, enabling both targeted treatment and real-time disease monitoring through biosensors or molecular imaging. This dual functionality could usher in a new era of personalized medicine for infectious and inflammatory skin conditions [227]. As the field advances, interdisciplinary collaboration across cell biology, materials science, clinical medicine, and regulatory affairs will be essential. With strategic research and innovation, EV-based platforms hold the potential to redefine the therapeutic landscape for SSTIs and overcome the escalating challenge of antimicrobial resistance [228].
    
    
      7. Conclusions
      SSTIs are becoming a bigger problem, especially with the growing number of pathogens that resist multiple drugs. Treatments currently available are not always effective. This review looks into a promising new option: EVs. These tiny particles could help in several ways, including fighting infections, boosting the immune system, and aiding tissue healing. EVs can come from various sources, such as MSCs, immune cells, bacteria, plants, and even animals. They have various functions, such as helping to change how immune cells work, regulating important substances in the body, breaking down biofilms, and encouraging new blood vessel growth. MSC-derived EVs are particularly interesting because they could be a way to treat tough SSTIs without using live cells. However, translation to clinical practice is still hindered by problems in standardization, delivery, scale-up, and regulatory approval. The path forward must include overcoming these challenges through technological innovation, clinical validation, and regulatory harmonization. EV-based therapies represent a promising adjunct or alternative to conventional antimicrobial therapies and may herald a paradigm shift in SSTI treatment, especially in the era of antimicrobial resistance.

Title: Adverse Effects and Precautionary Measures for Isotretinoin Use in Patients with Acne Vulgaris: A Single-Center Study

Abstract: Background: Oral isotretinoin is an effective treatment for refractory and moderate acne unresponsive to conventional therapies, considered the most effective option for such cases. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, concerns, and experiences of acne patients undergoing isotretinoin treatment in Qassim, Saudi Arabia, with a focus on commonly reported adverse effects. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2023 to February 2024 using a self-administered questionnaire. This study targeted male and female acne vulgaris patients from the Qassim region attending the outpatient dermatology clinic at King Saud Hospital (KSH). Results: A total of 131 acne patients participated. Of these, 97.7% had heard of isotretinoin, and 92.4% were aware of its side effects. The most common sources of information were colleagues, friends, or family (37.4%), followed by previous use (26%) and healthcare professionals (24%). The most frequently reported side effect was dryness (51.9%), followed by liver function changes (24.4%) and fetal abnormalities (13%). There was a significant association between educational level and knowledge of isotretinoin’s side effects (p = 0.003) and awareness of specific side effects (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Most acne patients had sufficient knowledge of isotretinoin and its adverse effects, with dryness being the most commonly reported side effect. The primary sources of information were non-medical, highlighting the need for health education to ensure informed and safe isotretinoin use.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Acne vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder [1]. Acne vulgaris affects approximately 117.4 million people worldwide [2]. An estimated 85% of individuals aged 12–24 are impacted by acne vulgaris [1,3]. In Saudi Arabia, some studies have reported a high prevalence of acne among adolescents and young adults, ranging from 56% to 71% [4,5,6]. A U.S. survey of over 1000 adults found that 43% of males and 51% of females self-reported acne in their 20s years. However, these rates declined by age 50 and older to 7% and 15%, respectively [7]. Acne affects all age groups but is commonly prevalent among adolescents by approximately 85% [2,3]. The prevalence of acne declines by age 50 and older to 7% and 15%, respectively [7]. Acne vulgaris is characterized by closed or open comedones, papules, pustules, or nodules [1]. Acne vulgaris primarily involves the face and trunk and may cause pain, redness, pigmentation changes, or scar formation [1]. The development of acne involves multiple factors, including increased sebum production, hormone dysregulation, stress, diet, microbial colonization with Cutibacterium acnes, follicular hyperkeratinization, and inflammation [1,8]. Although no standard grading system has been established for classification, a widely acceptable approach is to classify acne according to severity as mild, moderate, or severe [8]. Acne can cause a significant burden to individuals, as it is identified as the second most impactful skin disorder based on disability-adjusted life years [9]. It can also impact quality of life significantly to a similar extent as other chronic conditions such as asthma and arthritis [10]. Acne vulgaris can also lead to significant psychological consequences, including low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression [11,12].
      The mainstays of acne treatment have remained primarily unchanged over recent years [13]. Treatment options include topical and systemic therapies. The treatment regimen selection is based on several factors including the severity of acne, regions affected, patient preferences, potential adverse effects, and cost. Isotretinoin is derived from vitamin A and was introduced to the market in 1982 [14]. The mechanism of isotretinoin functions mainly by reducing the size of sebaceous glands and decreasing sebum production, with a half-life of 10–20 h [14]. Because of its significant risk of severe fetal malformations, isotretinoin use is strictly contraindicated in women of childbearing potential unless stringent contraceptive measures are implemented [14]. Oral isotretinoin stands out as one of the most effective therapies for moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris [8]. Oral isotretinoin is also used to manage mild to moderate acne refractory to topical and other oral therapy options [8]. The treatment dosage of isotretinoin depends on the severity of the acne. Treatment is generally initiated at a lower dose and can be adjusted based on the therapeutic response [8]. The two primary dosing strategies available include a standard regimen (0.5–1.0 mg/kg/day) and a low-dose regimen (<0.5 mg/kg/day) [8].
      A population-based study revealed that 64% of first isotretinoin prescriptions were given to patients who had not previously used other anti-acne medications [15]. This study shows that isotretinoin usage is predominant among individuals between 13 and 45 years, with 50% of the participants being female [15]. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced the iPLEDGE Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for all patients receiving isotretinoin in 2006 to prevent teratogenic risks [16]. Despite the strict regulatory measures in the iPLEDGE program, an estimated 150 fetal exposure to isotretinoin are reported every year [17]. Additionally, isotretinoin can lead to dermatologically adverse effects. A systematic review indicated that approximately 65% of all reported side effects were related to dermatologic conditions [18]. Additional adverse effects that required monitoring included hyperlipidemia, elevated liver enzymes, depression, photophobia, and headache [18]. This highlights the need for a comprehensive assessment of patients’ knowledge about isotretinoin side effects and its proper use.
      The majority of studies assessing isotretinoin in Saudi Arabia have primarily focused on evaluating the perceptions of the general public, investigating specific adverse effects, or assessing adherence to precautionary protocols. A study conducted on a sample of 3001 individuals from the general population in Saudi Arabia indicated that more than 50% had poor knowledge about the use of isotretinoin [19]. This is particularly concerning given the significant severity of the adverse effect profile associated with isotretinoin. Although one study included 356 dermatology clinic patients, participants in that research were recruited with the assistance of physicians and nurses and did not follow specific inclusion or exclusion criteria, which may have limited the accuracy and consistency of its responses [20]. In contrast, the present study targeted acne patients attending a dermatology clinic in the Qassim region, where a research team member was consistently present on-site to systematically recruit participants. This approach enhanced the reliability of patient-reported information and provides a novel perspective by capturing real-world experiences and awareness in a clinical setting. Additionally, we aimed to provide a more comprehensive survey of patients’ awareness of commonly reported adverse effects (e.g., teratogenicity, dryness, hepatotoxicity), adherence to precautionary measures, and experiences with the medication. By targeting acne patients directly, this study provides a focused evaluation of these critical aspects to help address gaps in patient education and counseling.
    
    
      2. Materials and Methods
      A cross-sectional study design was used to collect data from acne vulgaris patients through a self-administered questionnaire. This study was conducted in the dermatology outpatient clinics of a tertiary hospital in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia, from December 2023 to February 2024. This study obtained ethical approval from the Regional Research Ethics Committee of Qassim Province, which is registered under the National Committee of Bioethics (NCBE) with Registration No. H-04-Q-001. The reporting of this cross-sectional study follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines to ensure methodological transparency and completeness.
      The questionnaire used in this study was adopted after a review of previous studies published in the literature [20]. The questionnaire was then pretested on 10 patients with acne vulgaris to check the understanding and clarity of the questionnaire. The full questionnaire is included in the Supplementary Materials (Figure S1). The questionnaire consisted of 12 questions along with options for possible answers. This study specifically targeted patients in the Qassim region and implemented a rigorous methodology to enhance the reliability of the findings. A research team member was consistently present on-site at the dermatology clinic to systematically recruit patients with acne vulgaris and distribute the survey in person, thereby improving response accuracy and reducing selection bias.
      The respondents were asked to select the most relevant response to each question. The questionnaire collected demographic data, such as age, gender, marital status, and educational background. The survey then assessed patients’ familiarity with isotretinoin and their sources of information, whether from healthcare professionals, personal experiences, social contacts, or online sources. The questionnaire also evaluated patients’ understanding of isotretinoin’s common side effects, such as skin dryness, changes in liver function, and potential risks during pregnancy. This study addressed patients’ practical experiences with isotretinoin, including the most significant side effects patients encountered. Finally, this study further analyzed the responses based on gender and education to identify variations in knowledge, concerns, and experiences with the medication. This approach provided valuable insights into how demographic factors influence patients’ understanding and use of isotretinoin.
      
        2.1. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
        This study included acne vulgaris patients who were 15 years of age or older, had a documented current or recent history of using isotretinoin therapy within the past 12 months, and provided informed consent to participate, in accordance with the ethical approval granted by the Regional Research Ethics Committee. The minimum age of 15 years was selected based on epidemiological evidence indicating that individuals aged 15–29 years represented the primary group prescribed isotretinoin for acne treatment [21]. Additionally, patients younger than 15 years may have a limited capacity to provide accurate and reliable self-reported information regarding their treatment experiences and perceptions. The 12-month cutoff for recent isotretinoin therapy was determined based on practical considerations to balance recall accuracy with the need to capture experiences among patients who had recently completed treatment.
      
      
        2.2. Sample Size
        In this study, a convenience sample size of 131 patients was employed due to practical considerations and the availability of participants.
      
      
        2.3. Data Analysis
        The returned data responses were entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS, version 26, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive analysis was used for the categorical variables. The Chi-square test was used to find associations between the measured outcome and independent variables. A p-value of < 0.05 was used for any statistical significance associations obtained.
      
    
    
      3. Results
      
        3.1. Patients’ Demographic Characteristics
        A total of 131 patients participated and completed the survey, with 108 (82.4%) being females and 23 (17.6%) being males. The majority of the respondents were in the 23–33 age group, and 102 (77.9%) of the participants had a university-level education, as illustrated in Table 1.
      
      
        3.2. Patients’ Knowledge and Concerns About Isotretinoin
        A total of 128 respondents (97.7%) reported having prior knowledge about isotretinoin. Among those who were knowledgeable about isotretinoin, 108 (82.4%) were female, and 23 (17.6%) were male. The difference in knowledge between the genders was found to be statistically significant (p = 0.024). The most commonly reported sources of information were colleagues, friends, or family members, followed by acne patients with prior isotretinoin use, and then healthcare professionals. When patients were asked to identify the common side effects of isotretinoin, dryness was recognized by 68 patients (51.9%), followed by liver function changes, reported by 32 patients (24.4%), and fetal abnormalities, mentioned by 17 patients (13%). Regarding patient concerns, the most prominent issue associated with starting isotretinoin was the potential for side effects, reported by 88 patients (67.2%). This was followed by concerns about the duration of treatment, noted by 12 patients (9.2%), and pregnancy-related risks, mentioned by 5 patients (3.8%). Further details are outlined in Table 2.
      
      
        3.3. Patients’ Experience
        This study documented a range of side effects reported by patients, with skin dryness being the most frequently mentioned. Furthermore, the data indicates that 33 patients (25.2%) had not attempted any other treatment prior to initiating isotretinoin therapy. Additionally, 20 patients (15.3%) reported that they were not tested for liver enzymes either before or during the course of treatment. Additional details are provided in Table 3.
      
      
        3.4. Analysis of Knowledge, Concern Parameters, and Patients’ Experience with Isotretinoin
        This study assessed knowledge, concerns, and patients’ experience with isotretinoin based on gender and education groups. Significant differences were found in several areas. Female patients with acne were generally more knowledgeable about isotretinoin, with 107 females (83.6%) having prior knowledge compared to 21 males (16.4%) (p = 0.024). Additionally, 102 females (84.3%) had a general understanding of potential side effects compared to 19 males (15.7%) (p = 0.05). Regarding concerns when initiating isotretinoin, female patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of concern, with 79 females (89.8%) particularly concerned about potential side effects compared to only 9 males (10.2%) (p < 0.001). Furthermore, a statistically significant difference was observed in the prior use of acne medications, with 108 females (82.4%) being more likely to have used other treatments compared to 23 males (17.6%) (p = 0.012). However, no significant associations were identified between gender and the source of information, specific side effects known by the patients, and the most frequently reported side effects, as detailed in Table 4 and Table 5.
        Educational background also influenced the knowledge of side effects, as shown in Table 6. University-educated patients demonstrated a higher awareness (77.9%) compared to those with a school-level education (22.1%) (p = 0.003).
      
    
    
      4. Discussion
      This study assessed the knowledge, concerns, and experiences with isotretinoin among individuals with acne vulgaris. The findings were analyzed according to gender and education levels, providing critical insights into patient awareness and the use of this widely prescribed treatment for moderate to severe acne. A notable 97.7% of participants reported prior awareness of isotretinoin. However, the most frequently cited sources of information were non-healthcare professionals. The primary source of information identified in this study was colleagues, friends, or family members (37.4%), followed by previous users of isotretinoin (26.0%). Only 24.4% of participants received information from medical doctors or pharmacists. Similar results were observed in previous studies where nearly half of the patients relied on non-medical sources for information about isotretinoin [22,23]. These findings highlight a significant gap in counseling for patients with acne vulgaris, particularly those using isotretinoin. This gap is concerning given the well-documented risk profile of isotretinoin, including its pronounced teratogenic effects. This reliance on non-medical sources of information increases the likelihood of misinformation and the improper use of the medication, potentially leading to adverse outcomes. In this study, 92.4% of participants perceived themselves as generally knowledgeable about the potential side effects of isotretinoin. This result aligns with other studies that have shown acne patients often consider themselves well informed about isotretinoin [24,25]. However, our findings indicate that only 3.8% of participants recognized the teratogenic risks associated with its use, raising concerns about the sources of information patients rely on. The evidence suggests that poor adherence with contraceptive recommendations and prevention protocols among patients, pharmacists, and prescribers remains a global issue, which can lead to detrimental consequences such as unintended pregnancies and severe fetal abnormalities [26].
      Healthcare providers should ensure equitable access to information and counseling for acne patients, particularly those prescribed isotretinoin. The high levels of burnout reported among dermatologists and pharmacists in various settings may contribute to reduced patient counseling and the inconsistent reinforcement of precautionary measures related to isotretinoin use [27,28]. In this study, female patients demonstrated significantly better knowledge of isotretinoin and its side effects than male patients with acne. Specifically, 83.6% of female participants were aware of isotretinoin, compared to only 16.4% of males (p = 0.024). Additionally, 84.3% of females had a general understanding of the medication’s potential side effects, such as dryness and liver function changes, whereas only 15.7% of males had similar knowledge (p = 0.05). This disparity may be attributed to female patients having more opportunities to access information about isotretinoin or being more proactive in seeking such information. The sample’s overrepresentation of university students and female participants may have influenced the results. University students are likely to demonstrate greater baseline knowledge, higher exposure to health education, and more proactive attitudes toward health-related topics compared to the general population. Similarly, female respondents tend to exhibit elevated health-seeking behaviors and utilization of health information, potentially leading to more aware or educated responses [29]. Consequently, these demographic biases may limit the generalizability of the findings to populations with a lower educational attainment or different gender distributions, highlighting the need for caution in broader interpretation.
      This study also investigated side effect experiences among acne patients using isotretinoin. The most commonly reported side effects were skin dryness (45.8%) and dryness of the eyes and nose (34.4%). This is consistent with other studies that showed dryness being the most common adverse effect experienced with isotretinoin [23,25,30]. While these are well-documented side effects of isotretinoin, their high prevalence among the participants highlights the importance of educating patients on how to manage these adverse effects, such as using moisturizers and eye drops. Interestingly, 7.6% of patients reported no side effects, indicating variability in the tolerance to the medication.
      Liver function monitoring is a key parameter of isotretinoin therapy due to its potential hepatotoxicity. In this study, 55.7% of patients reported undergoing liver function tests before starting isotretinoin and continuing them every three months during treatment, while 29% reported testing only before starting treatment. However, 15.3% of patients did not undergo any liver function testing, raising concerns about adherence to monitoring protocols. Another study by Imam et al. showed that an even higher percentage of participants, namely more than half of their participants, did not undergo liver function tests before isotretinoin therapy [30]. These findings highlight the need for healthcare providers to emphasize the importance of regular testing and follow-up to ensure the safe use of isotretinoin.
      In conclusion, while this study demonstrates a high awareness of isotretinoin, significant gaps remain in knowledge, particularly among male patients, regarding the side effects and the importance of monitoring during treatment. Gender differences suggest that female patients are more engaged and concerned about the risks associated with isotretinoin use. However, further education and counseling are still needed, particularly regarding the teratogenic effects of isotretinoin.
      
        Strengths and Limitations of This Study
        This study is one of the few to specifically assess the knowledge, concerns, and experiences of acne patients using isotretinoin, as well as the common side effects encountered. However, it has several limitations. First, this study relied on a cross-sectional design and self-reported data, which limits the ability to infer causality and may introduce social desirability bias. This potential bias may have led participants to respond to questions about their knowledge and practices in a way they believed was expected. Second, patients’ knowledge and behaviors regarding isotretinoin may change over time, which is an inherent limitation of the cross-sectional design. Third, the study population was predominantly female and highly educated (university students), introducing a potential selection bias that may limit the representativeness of the findings to the broader acne patient population. Fourth, this study had a relatively small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Finally, although similar studies have been conducted in other countries, differences in cultural context, healthcare systems, and patient education practices may limit the direct comparability of the findings.
        Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable insights and guidance. Our study specifically targeted acne vulgaris patients, which allowed for a more accurate representation of the sample. In contrast to prior investigations conducted in the general population or via online surveys, our approach ensured that only patients with clinically confirmed acne vulgaris who were receiving isotretinoin participated. The patients were recruited directly from dermatology clinics to strengthen the relevance and reliability of the findings for real-world clinical settings. Additionally, this offers important insights for health authorities in Saudi Arabia, highlighting the need to strictly enhance monitoring protocols for isotretinoin. Furthermore, this study emphasizes that healthcare providers should not assume that patients’ knowledge is always reliable, as their sources of information may not be accurate. Future studies could incorporate additional assessment methods, such as structured interviews or focus groups, to complement self-reported questionnaires and provide more in-depth insights. Additionally, future research should employ more rigorous sampling methods and larger sample sizes and consider multiple healthcare settings from different regions to improve the generalizability of the results.
      
    
    
      5. Conclusions
      This study highlights that the majority of acne patients demonstrate an adequate level of knowledge regarding isotretinoin and its adverse effects. The most frequently reported side effects were dryness of the skin, eyes, and nose. However, patients with acne require further counseling, particularly concerning the teratogenic risks and the importance of monitoring parameters during treatment. The primary sources of information about isotretinoin were non-medical, including colleagues, friends, or family members, followed by personal prior use and healthcare professionals such as physicians and pharmacists. A significant association was observed between patients’ educational levels and their knowledge of isotretinoin’s side effects, as well as their understanding of specific adverse reactions. This study also revealed significant associations between gender and both knowledge of isotretinoin and concerns about initiating treatment.

Title: Comparison of Polyphenolic Content and Bioactivities Between Extracts from the Living Plants and Beach Deposits of the Submerged Brackish Water Angiosperm Ruppia maritima

Abstract: Bioactive extracts from living plants (LR) and beach deposits (NR) of the submerged brackish water angiosperm Ruppia maritima were examined for their antioxidant activity and anticancer potential. LR extract scavenged effectively free radicals with IC50 values of 38.00 μg/mL (DPPH•), 12.00 μg/mL (ABTS•+), 281.00 μg/mL (OH•), and 53.00 μg/mL (O2•), and exhibited reducing activity with an RP0.5AU value of 37.00 μg/mL. NR extract retained a significant part of LR extract’s antioxidant activity by scavenging free radicals with IC50 values of 180.00 μg/mL (DPPH•), 60.00 μg/mL (ABTS•+), and 164.00 μg/mL (O2•), and exhibited reducing activity with an RP0.5AU value of 107.00 μg/mL. Importantly, NR extract (IC50 value: 60.00 μg/mL) exhibited much higher inhibitory activity than LR extract (IC50 value: 1100.00 μg/mL) in XTT assay. HPLC analysis revealed that both R. maritima extracts contained phenolics, such as chicoric acid, quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside, p-coumaric acid, 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxicinnanic acid, trans-ferulic acid, and rutin hydrate, possessing antioxidant and/or anticancer activity. Thus, the present study showed for the first time that R. maritima extracts from either LR or NR are a promising source of bioactive compounds having beneficial properties for human health.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Marine angiosperms (also known as seagrasses) and submerged brackish water angiosperms exhibit a dominant role in the structure and function of coastal and transitional ecosystems [1,2,3]. Submerged brackish water angiosperms, such as those of the genus Ruppia (family Ruppiaceae), tolerate a wide range of salinity values, and so they are entirely restricted at low intertidal elevations to permanent and ephemeral brackish lagoons, salt marshes, and sheltered shallow bays [2,3,4]. Ruppia maritima Linnaeus is the most prevalent brackish water angiosperm species of Ruppia genus [5]. R. maritima is a common species in European coastal lagoons, especially Mediterranean [4,6,7,8,9].
      Since ancient times, seagrasses were used as food and in traditional medicine to treat skin diseases, fever, muscle and stomach pain, insect bites, and burns, as well as aphrodisiac, vasoprotective, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and contraceptive agents [10,11,12]. These activities of seagrasses are attributed to both their primary bioactive components (e.g., fibers, proteins, sulfated polysaccharides, acids, fats, and oils) [13,14], and secondary metabolites (e.g., polyphenols, alkaloids, and steroids) [11,15,16]. Possible bioactive compounds have been isolated from R. maritima [17], but their activities have not been fully investigated.
      Seagrasses, and specifically submerged brackish water angiosperms, like R. maritima, are exposed to various biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic stresses, due to the excessive diversity and complexity of their ecosystems [4,18,19,20], which may lead to reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction [16,21,22]. Subsequently, ROS overproduction stimulates enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules in plant cells [18,21,23,24,25,26]. (Poly)phenolic compounds possessing antioxidant activity, such as chicoric acid and flavonoid derivatives of quercetin and isorhamnetin, have been identified in R. maritima [17]. However, its extracts’ effects against free radical scavenging have never been assessed previously. Bioactive compounds from seagrasses have also exhibited anticancer activity [16,27,28]. However, extracts from R. maritima have not, so far, been investigated for their anticancer properties.
      It is worth noting that not only the extracts from living plants, but also those from their beach deposits consisting of decomposing plants (e.g., P. oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa) that wash up on shores, contain minerals, (poly)phenols, carotenoids, tannins, active carbohydrate enzymes, lignocellulose degradation enzymes, and other natural derivatives, with antioxidant, antiviral, antifungal, antidiabetic, vasoprotective, and anticancer properties [16,29]. From ancient Egypt until today, seagrass beach deposits have been used in medicine to treat different pathological conditions such as pain, skin diseases, acne, hypertension, and inflammation [30]. Seagrasses have high resistance to decay [31] and their bioactive compounds (e.g., phenolics) are preserved during their deposition on shores [32].
      Seagrasses and submerged brackish water angiosperms, due to their significant ecological importance, are protected by international conventions [3,33,34], and thus there is a great need to protect and preserve their habitats [35]. In Mediterranean countries, there is still no legislative framework that strictly prevents the removal of seagrass beach deposits from shores [16]. However, at the initiative of the municipal authorities, dead plant material of seagrasses (mainly of P. oceanica and C. nodosa) is often removed from coasts, unplanned and at high cost, and disposed of in landfills as waste. Thus, the possibility of utilizing marine and brackish water angiosperms’ beach deposits to produce high added value products possessing beneficial properties for human health, such as antioxidant or anticancer properties, is of great importance. Since, it may also lead to their proper utilization and management.
      Thus, the aim of the present study was to prepare extracts from living plants (LR) and beach deposits on shores, also referred to as ‘necromass’ (NR), of the submerged brackish water angiosperm R. maritima, and identify their (poly)phenolic compounds. In addition, we used the collection area of R. maritima in ‘Monolimni’ Lagoon (Evros River Delta) as a ’case study’ to estimate the total quantity of phenolic compounds that can be produced from NR. Apart from phenolics, we compared the protein content between LR and NR plant material as an indication of the degree of NR decomposition. Moreover, we assessed the extracts’ free radical scavenging activity against 2,2-diphenyl-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH•), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS•+), superoxide (O2•−), and hydroxyl (OH•) radicals, as well as their reducing activity. In addition, we evaluated ROS levels and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like and ascorbic peroxidase (APX)-like, in both LR and NR plant materials to determine whether these measurements could correlate with the tested extracts’ antioxidant activity. Furthermore, we examined LR and NR extracts for their ability to inhibit the growth of human colon cancer cells. To date, no other study has examined extracts from either LR or NR of R. maritima for their bioactivities.
    
    
      2. Results and Discussion
      
        2.1. Oxidative Stress, Antioxidant Enzyme Activity, and Protein Content of Ruppia maritima Living Plant (LR) and Beach Deposit (NR) Samples
        The excessive diversity of seagrasses and submerged brackish water angiosperms leads to exposure to various biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic stresses, and thus to ROS overproduction and stimulation of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules [19,24,25,26,36]. As a result, oxidative stress contributes to the activation of antioxidant mechanisms, which neutralize or prevent the production of free radicals, and repair the affected molecules [16]. Thus, we assessed the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production and activity of the antioxidant enzymes SOD-like and APX-like in both LR and NR leaf samples of R. maritima, as an initial indication of the plant’s antioxidant potential. Moreover, the protein content was compared between the two samples to determine the degree of NR degradation.
        Specifically, the assessment of the intracellular H2O2 levels expressed as the value of the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF), was used as an indicator of oxidative stress [24,25,26]. The results showed that the CTCF values of LR and NR leaf samples of R. maritima did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) and were 1,009,977 and 1,292,208, respectively (Figure 1D–F). Thus, oxidative stress existed in R. maritima LR and it slightly changed after plant abscission (i.e., in NR samples). Like H2O2 levels, there were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) in the activity of SOD-like and APX-like between LR and NR samples (Figure 1A,B). In particular, SOD-like activity was 91.89 and 144.10 U/mg of protein in LR and NR samples, respectively (Figure 1A), while APX-like activity was 6.93 and 6.58 U/mg of protein in LR and NR samples, respectively (Figure 1B). Thus, as expected, since oxidative stress did not differ between LR and NR samples, their antioxidant response was also similar. Moreover, protein content in the LR sample (18.33 mg/g wet weight) was not significantly different (p > 0.05) from that of the NR sample (17.09 mg/g wet weight) (Figure 1C), indicating that there was not significant decomposition of the NR sample until the collection time. This observation was consistent with other studies demonstrating that marine angiosperms are highly resistant to decay [31].
      
      
        2.2. Determination of (Poly)phenolic Composition of LR and NR Extracts from Ruppia maritima
        As a response to oxidative stress, seagrasses produce secondary metabolites (e.g., phenolic compounds), which, in turn, contribute to the bioactivities of the produced extracts [14,16,37]. Thus, we performed quantitative and qualitative analyses of phenolic compounds in both LR and NR extracts from R. maritima (Figure 2). From the 12 individual phenolic compounds analyzed, both LR and NR extracts contained the following compounds, in decreasing order regarding their amount: chicoric acid, quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside, p-coumaric acid, rutin hydrate, sinapic acid (i.e., 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid), trans-ferulic acid, trans-cinnamic acid, and caftaric acid (Table 1; Figure 2).
        The quantity of the individual phenolic compounds as mg/g of d.w. was similar between LR and NR extracts. Moreover, taking into account their extraction yield (i.e., 28% for LR and 10.3% for NR extract) (Table 1), the total phenolic compounds determined as mg/g of d.w. of the initial plant samples were only 2.4-fold higher in the LR sample compared to the NR sample (Table 1). In P. oceanica leaves, a significant loss of the total phenolic content (from 100- to 120-fold) and in the number of the individual phenolic compounds has been observed during its deposition on coasts [16,38]. Obviously, this occurred in P. oceanica due to the long period that the dead leaves remained on the shore [16,38]. Thus, the relatively low loss of phenolic compounds, from R. maritima NR samples compared to LR samples, may be attributed to the likely short time (about 48 h) that the former were remained on the shore before their collection. Other studies have also exhibited that seagrasses’ phenolic compounds are preserved after their deposition on shores [31]. Phenolics are not easily biodegradable because they are toxic to most microorganisms and therefore exhibit antimicrobial activity [39]. However, the phenolic compounds found in seagrass beach deposits may be affected by several biotic factors (e.g., microbial degradation) and abiotic factors (e.g., UV sunlight and temperature) [40,41,42]. Specifically, under aerobic conditions, microbial degradation of phenolics occurs through their oxygenation into catechols as metabolic intermediates, followed by ring cleavage at either the ortho or meta position [40]. Under anaerobic conditions, phenolics’ biodegradation proceeds through carboxylation, followed by dehydroxylation and dearomatization [40]. Common bacteria and yeasts capable of efficiently decomposing phenolic compounds include strains of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, and Candida [39,43]. In general, due to the limited number of studies on seagrass-associated microbiomes, the interplay between seagrasses and their microbiomes in the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds requires further investigation [44]. In addition, the extent of phenolic compound degradation depends on reactions with hydroxyl or superoxide ion radicals, and is influenced by sunlight (i.e., UV and visible light) and other environmental conditions (e.g., pH) [42]. Another factor influencing the chemical composition of seagrasses is the desiccation process [45,46], although this requires further investigation for R. maritima. It should be noted, however, that intertidal macrophytes including Ruppia species generally have a higher tolerance to desiccation and thermal stress than other macrophyte species [45]. Moreover, in our study, R. maritima NR was exposed to temperature and UV/solar radiation conditions likely similar to those experienced by the living plants. The lagoon was very shallow (i.e., 50–70 cm), and thus a large part of the living plants floated at the water surface and was directly exposed to the air.
        Chicoric acid was the most abundant phenolic in both LR and NR extracts, with values of 41.09 and 45.4 mg/g d.w. of extract, respectively. In a previous study, chicoric acid was also reported as the most abundant phenolic compound of extracts from R. maritima and R. cirrhosa [17]. Specifically, the amount of chicoric acid was close to our values and ranged from 27.9 to 30.2 mg/g of d.w. in R. maritima extracts, and from 10.6 to 29.2 mg/g of d.w. in R. cirrhosa extracts [17]. It is noteworthy that chicoric acid is considered a high value-added nutraceutical, due to its beneficial properties for human health [47]. Specifically, chicoric acid has been reported to exhibit antioxidant [48], anti-inflammatory [49], antiviral [50], and anti-aging [51] properties, as well as activity against gastrointestinal diseases [49]. Moreover, it may regulate glucose and lipid metabolism [52], thus possibly exerting prevention against diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. However, the availability of chicoric acid is limited, and so there is the need to discover new sources of it [53]. Moreover, DellaGreca et al. [54] detected in R. maritima plants some other phenolic compounds, which were not determined in the present study. In extracts from Cymodocea nodosa and P. oceanica collected from the Mediterranean Sea, chicoric acid was also found in high amounts ranging from 3.19 to 18.52 and from 0.004 to 12.78 mg/g d.w. of extract, respectively [14,16,38,55,56,57]. It should be noted that all of the above phenolics identified in our R. maritima LR and NR extracts have also been found in extracts from the living leaves of P. oceanica seagrass [16,56,57]. However, only chicoric acid, p-coumaric acid, trans-cinnamic acid, trans-ferulic acid, and quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside were found in extracts from P. oceanica’s beach casts [16,38,57]. In extracts from living plants of C. nodosa, among the above substances, chicoric acid, caftaric acid, p-coumaric acid, quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside, and trans-cinnamic acid were detected, whereas in its beach deposit extracts, only chicoric acid remained [10,14,58].
        The phenolic profile of the above seagrass species is similar and relatively simple, with only one or two phenolic compounds dominating. This may be due to the fact that these organisms reproduce mainly through vegetative reproduction, thus limiting genetic inconsistencies [57]. Additionally, although seagrasses colonized the marine environment from terrestrial angiosperm ancestors, no fundamental modifications have appeared in their phenolic profiles [58].
      
      
        2.3. Antioxidant Activity of LR and NR Extracts from Ruppia maritima
        R. maritima LR and NR extracts were examined in vitro for their antioxidant capacity. The results showed that both LR and NR extracts scavenged DPPH• with IC50 values of 38.00 and 180.00 μg/mL, respectively (Figure 3). Moreover, both extracts scavenged ABTS•+ (IC50 values: LR 12.00 μg/mL vs. NR 60.00 μg/mL) and O2•− (IC50 values: LR 53.00 μg/mL vs. NR 164.00 μg/mL) (Figure 3). Remarkably, in OH• scavenging assay, only the LR extract exhibited an IC50 value, which was equal to 281.00 μg/mL (Figure 3). It was remarkable that both extracts exhibited more potency in ABTS•+ assay than DPPH• assay, since their IC50 values were lower in the former assay. The ability of the tested extracts to scavenge O2•− and OH• is significant. Both of these free radicals are produced in living organisms through a number of biochemical and physiological processes, and their overproduction may lead to oxidative stress and subsequently to different diseases [59]. Ascorbic acid, the positive control of these assays, as a pure compound, had much lower IC50 values than the tested extracts (ascorbic acid could not be tested only in O2•− assay because it can reduce NBT) [60] (Figure 3). However, in OH• scavenging assay, LR extract had scavenging activity comparable to that of ascorbic acid (Figure 3).
        In addition, we assessed the reducing activity of both extracts. As known, reducing capacity is an indicator of antioxidant activity, since free radicals are neutralized after receiving electrons [61]. Thus, in reducing power (RP) assay, LR and NR extracts exhibited RP0.05AU values of 37.00 and 107.00 μg/mL, respectively (Figure 3).
        The observed antioxidant capacity of the tested extracts could be attributed to their phenolic compounds identified by HPLC, since most of them have been reported to possess antioxidant activity. For example, several studies have demonstrated chicoric acid, the most abundant of the identified phenolics, to act as a free radical scavenger and protect cells from oxidative stress [62,63,64]. Quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside has also been reported to scavenge ABTS•+ and DPPH• radicals and possess reducing activity [65]. Spectroscopic analysis has also revealed that p-coumaric acid effectively scavenged ABTS•+ and DPPH• radicals and exhibited reducing activity [66]. Furthermore, several cell culture [67] and in vivo studies [68] have shown p-coumaric acid to protect from ROS-induced harmful conditions. In addition, rutin hydrate has been demonstrated to scavenge, with high potency, ABTS•+ and DPPH• radicals [69]. Nićiforović et al. [70] reported sinapic acid scavenged DPPH• and O2•− radicals, and protected different tissues, such as gastric [71], nervous [72], testicular [73] and renal [74] tissues, from oxidative stress-induced damage.
        Since lower IC50 or RP0.05AU values indicate higher antioxidant capacity, all the above antioxidant assays clearly demonstrated that the LR extract possessed stronger antioxidant activity than the NR extract. Specifically, the LR extract had from 2.9- to 5.0-fold lower IC50 values than the NR extract in the antioxidant assays. As a rule of thumb, in in vitro antioxidant assays such as those used in the present study, differences in IC50 greater than 2-fold are generally considered biologically meaningful in the literature. However, the IC50 values of the NR extract indicated that the beach deposits of R. maritima retained a significant part of the antioxidant potency of the living plant. Obviously, differences in chemical composition between LR and NR extracts accounted for their different antioxidant activity. However, our results did not show great changes in the (poly)phenolic composition between the two extracts. Thus, the present results suggested that not only the tested phenolics, but also other bioactive compounds, contribute to the antioxidant activity of R. maritima extracts. Moreover, there was no significant difference in either oxidative stress (i.e., H2O2 production) or antioxidant enzyme levels of R. maritima LR and NR samples before they were used for extraction. However, since LR and NR extracts exhibited different antioxidant activity, H2O2, SOD-like, and APX-like levels cannot be suggested as reliable indicators of the antioxidant capacity of the produced extracts.
        Interestingly, the present study is the first to examine the antioxidant activity of extracts from either living plants or beach deposits of R. maritima. Enerstvedt et al. [17] isolated a crude extract from living leaves of R. cirrhosa using a method similar to ours. However, they also prepared a purified extract by applying the crude extract to a resin column. The crude extract of R. cirrhosa had an IC50 value of 152.9 μg/mL in DPPH• assay, while the purified extract had a value of 31.8 μg/mL [17]. The antioxidant potency of the purified extract of R. cirrhosa was close to that of our R. maritima LR extract. Furthermore, the fact that the R. cirrhosa crude extract had antioxidant potency similar to that of our NR extract provided further evidence that the beach deposits of R. maritima retained significant antioxidant activity. Moreover, in one of our previous studies [16], extracts from beach cast leaves of P. oceanica exhibited much lower antioxidant activity compared to the R. maritima NR extract. For example, in DPPH• and ABTS•+ assays, extracts from beach-cast leaves of P. oceanica had IC50 values of 2850 and 660 μg/mL, respectively [16].
      
      
        2.4. Inhibitory Activity of LR and NR Extracts from Ruppia maritima Against Cancer Cell Growth
        In addition, we examined the LR and NR extracts from R. maritima for their inhibitory activity against colon cancer cell growth. The results showed that both extracts dose-dependently inhibited human colon cancer LS174 cell viability (Figure 4). Specifically, the LR extract exhibited a significant reduction in cell viability, by 39% at 250.00 μg/mL, while at 2000.00 μg/mL the cell viability was reduced by 80% (Figure 4). The NR extract demonstrated a significant decrease in cell viability, by 22% at 30 μg/mL, while at 250 μg/mL the reduction in cell viability was 90% (Figure 4). The IC50 values of LR and NR extracts against colon cancer cell growth were 1100.00 and 60.00 μg/mL, respectively (Figure 4). The IC50 value of the positive control, doxorubicin, was 9.13 μg/mL (Figure 4). Intriguingly, while the LR extract was more potent than the NR extract in all antioxidant assays, the latter exhibited about 18-fold higher inhibitory activity against cancer cell growth than the former. In cell proliferation assays, such as XTT assay, differences in IC50 values greater than 2-fold are considered biologically meaningful. This result suggested that the R. maritima extracts’ bioactive compounds accounting for the inhibition of cancer cell growth were different from those responsible for the antioxidant activity.
        To examine the selective cytotoxic activity of the tested extracts against cancer cells, their cytotoxicity was also assessed against normal cells, specifically human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The results showed that the LR extract had a significantly higher IC50 value in MSCs than LS174 cells (IC50: 1700.00 vs. 1100.00 μg/mL, respectively; Figure 4). Similarly, the NR extract exhibited a significantly higher IC50 value in MSCs than in LS174 cells (IC50: 280.00 vs. 60.00 μg/mL, respectively; Figure 4). Specifically, the selectivity index (SI), (i.e., the ratio of the IC50 in cancer cells to the IC50 in normal cells) was 1.5 for the LR extract and 4.7 for the NR extract. An SI greater than 2 is generally considered indicative of significant selectivity in cancer cell inhibition [75]. Thus, the present results indicated that, the NR extract in particular may exert selective inhibitory activity against colon cancer cell growth.
        Among the identified phenolics, chicoric acid was the most abundant in R. maritima extracts. Plant extracts rich in chicoric acid have been demonstrated to possess anticancer properties [76,77]. For example, extracts derived from the terrestrial plants Linum numidicum, Linum trigynum, and Taraxacum officinale, which were rich in chicoric acid, inhibited the growth of liver, prostate, and breast cancer cell lines [76,77]. A number of studies have also shown that p-coumaric acid exerted cytotoxic effects on human epidermoid, melanoma, gastric, glioblastoma, and colorectal cancer cells [78,79,80,81,82]. Specifically, p-coumaric acid inhibited colon cancer cell growth through induction of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis by downregulating the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 proteins and upregulating the pro-apoptotic BAX protein. Moreover, p-coumaric acid caused cell cycle arrest by downregulating cdc2/cyclin B activity [83]. In addition, sinapic acid has been shown to inhibit human prostate, pancreatic, and colon cancer cell lines [84,85,86]. Regarding human colon cancer cells, sinapic acid induced apoptosis through an increase in the pro-apoptotic cleaved caspase-3 and BAX proteins [86].
        However, the quantities of the above phenolics did not change significantly between the LR and NR extracts, while the NR extract exhibited higher inhibition of cancer cell growth. Thus, apart from the identified phenolics, other NR extract’s bioactive compounds may have also attributed to the cytotoxicity against cancer cells. The processes of R. maritima leaf abscission and subsequent drying, as well as the existence of distinct degradation metabolites, might lead to the production of metabolites having cytotoxic properties against cancer cells. Interestingly, microbial metabolites of polyphenols have been reported to enhance their bioactivities [44].
      
      
        2.5. Case Study for the Quantification of the Bioactive Extract Produced by Ruppia maritima Beach Deposits in the Collection Area
        Submerged brackish water angiosperms, such as R. maritima, in coastal and transitional habitats, are of significant ecological importance. Moreover, the present findings indicated that extracts from living R. maritima plants contain significant amounts of (poly)phenolic compounds (Table 1). Thus, living R. maritima plants can be utilized to produce extracts exhibiting beneficial bioactivities for human health [87]. For example, since R. maritima’s polyphenolic extracts exhibited antioxidant activity, they could be used as food supplements or incorporated into functional foods to protect from oxidative stress [87,88]. In addition, R. maritima extracts, due to their antioxidant activity, could be used in cosmetic products aimed at protecting from UV-induced oxidative stress, which leads to skin aging [89]. Moreover, seagrass extracts with antioxidant activity and rich in chicoric acid, such as those from R. maritima, have been shown to maintain skin elasticity through promotion of collagen synthesis, and to prevent signs of aging [89]. Finally, R. maritima extracts may be used to develop nutraceuticals for treating oxidative stress-induced diseases and prevention from cancer [90]. Natural compounds are often renewable resources and tend to exhibit lower toxicity and fewer side effects compared to conventional drugs [90]. Since these extracts are suggested for product development, it is worth noting that they retained their tested bioactivities after three years of storage at −20 °C. Of course, further studies are needed to investigate, for example, the bioavailability or potential adverse effects of the tested extracts. So far, available data on these issues come from the literature and concern their main identified compounds (i.e., chicoric acid, quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside, and p-coumaric acid). Thus, pharmacokinetic studies on chicoric acid have demonstrated its bioavailability to be approximately 1.5% after oral administration of extracts containing 2% of chicoric acid in rats [91]. Chicoric acid’s bioavailability may be enhanced by encapsulation in nanomicelle formulations [92]. Quercetin-3-O-glucoside is absorbed by humans via specific transporters in the small intestine [93]. p-Coumaric acid exhibits efficient absorption and metabolism in animal models, with preliminary evidence suggesting similar bioavailability in humans [94,95]. Chicoric acid, quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside, and p-coumaric acid are generally considered safe for human consumption. However, like any bioactive compound, they may have potential adverse effects such as allergies, gastrointestinal disturbances, nephrotoxicity, and drug interactions, particularly at high doses or in sensitive individuals [53,96,97,98].
        Moreover, there should be acceptable management programs exerting the least possible impact on R. maritima ecosystems. Another option could be the development of cultivation methods for R. maritima. Moreover, the present results suggested that R. maritima beach deposits, after taking into account acceptable management programs, could be used for (poly)phenolic compounds’ production, since significant amounts of these compounds remain after plants’ deposition on coasts.
        The collection area of the Monolimni Lagoon, located in the estuary of the Evros River (northeastern Aegean Sea, Greece), was used as a ‘case study’ to estimate the total amount of NR extract and the individual phenolic compounds that can be produced. In this area, along a 100 m shoreline, the volume of R. maritima beach deposits was calculated to be about 7.0 m3. Thus, R. maritima beach deposits were calculated to be 94.28 kg Kg wet weight (or 56.39 kg d.w., after drying at 50 °C). Given that the NR extraction yield was 10.3% (Table 1), the amount of NR extract that could be produced corresponds to 5.81 kg, containing a total of 438.71 g d.w. of the seven phenolic compounds quantified by HPLC (Table 2). The amount of the individual phenolic compounds that can be produced in this area is presented in Table 2. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, there are no management regulations for R. maritima beach deposits. However, in management programs of seagrasses, such as those for P. oceanica, up to 20% of its beach deposits is usually allowed for collection [16]. If the management programs for P. oceanica were also applied for R. maritima beach deposits, the total amount of R. maritima NR extracts that could be used from the collection area would be 1.16 kg. Similarly, the individual phenolic compounds that could be used would correspond to 20% of their estimated production, as presented in Table 2.
      
    
    
      3. Materials and Methods
      
        3.1. Sampling of Living Plants and Beach Deposits of Ruppia maritima
        We collected plants of the submerged brackish water angiosperm R. maritima Linnaeus in early July 2022 from a depth of 60 cm from the ‘Monolimni’ Lagoon (40°46′ N, 22°03′ E) of the Evros River Delta (northern Aegean Sea, Greece). The ‘Monolimni’ Lagoon occupies an area of approximately 1.12 km2, connects to the sea through a 15 m wide opening, and is permanently flooded. In the collection period, the composition of the vegetation in the inner part of this lagoon was homogeneous, consisting mainly of R. maritima plants (Figure 5A) and the macroalga Gracilaria bursa-pastoris. In this area, the perennial population of R. maritima grows from April to October and reproduces during summer, in the innermost part of the permanent Monolimni Lagoon [4]. Like other perennial Ruppia populations growing in the Mediterranean area, plant decomposition is observed after early to mid-summer, and then from early or mid-autumn onwards, leading to beach deposits on the shores [4].
        We collected R. maritima living plant samples (LR) (Figure 5A,B) using a 20 cm diameter acrylic corer that penetrated the sediment to a depth of 30 cm [4]. The plant samples were then transported to the laboratory in containers with brackish water. The plant leaves used in our study presented the following phenological characteristics: leaf length 8.8 ± 0.3 cm, leaf width 0.98 ± 0.01 mm, number of leaves per shoot 2.67 ± 0.07, number of shoots/m2 3500 ± 10, and leaf biomass 25.5 g d.w./m2. Moreover, the roots of the plants had the following phenological characteristics: orthotropic rhizome biomass 3.5 ± 1.8 g d.w./m2, plagiotropic rhizome biomass 8.6 ± 1.7 d.w./m2, root biomass 3.5 ± 0.4 g d.w./m2, orthotropic rhizome internode length 3.9 ± 0.2 cm, plagiotropic rhizome internode length 0.8 ± 0.07 cm, and root length 5.1 ± 0.3 cm.
        Beach deposit NR material consisting of whole R. maritima plants washed up on the shore was also collected from the study area (Figure 5C,D). In July 2022, in the collection area of the R. maritima beach deposits, the volume and the total mass of NR material that washed up on the shores were estimated along a 100 m coastline. Field observations in the days preceding the sampling day and on the sampling day (7 July 2022) indicated that the plant deposits remained deposited for less than 48 h. During this period, the air temperature ranged between 18 °C and 31 °C (mean 26 °C) and the day length was approximately 14 h. The length of the collection area’s coastline was 100 m and the width (i.e., the distance between the lowest and highest point of the NR deposition on the coast) was 2 m (mean value) (Figure 5C). The height of the NR measured from the coast level was 4 cm (mean value) (Figure 5C).
        In addition, ten samples of NR were collected using a metal frame of 40 × 40 cm. After collection, the samples were dried in an oven at 50 °C for two days. The drying temperature at 50 °C was chosen because, according to the literature, it does not appear to affect phenolic composition or their bioactivities [44,99]. For example, the ideal drying temperatures for plant material to retain polyphenols and flavonoids and their antioxidant activity have been reported to range from 55 to 70 °C [99]. Moreover, Ameen et al. [44] reported that the best extraction conditions for seagrasses are usually achieved by maintaining temperatures between room temperature and 60 °C. In addition, in the marine angiosperm P. oceanica, heat treatment at 60 °C for a short duration (i.e., two days) was found to be more effective for recovering phenolic compounds compared to five days at 37 °C [38]. After drying, the plant material’s weight was assessed. Based on the above measurements, we estimated the mass of the NR material along a 100 m coastline used as a ‘case study’ area. Finally, taking into account the extraction yield percentage of NR extract and the amount of each phenolic compound in it, the amount of the NR extract and each phenolic compound that could be produced in the ‘case study’ area were estimated.
      
      
        3.2. Imaging of Hydrogen Peroxide Production in Leaves from Living Plants (LR) and Beach Deposits (NR) of Ruppia maritima
        We assessed the H2O2 production in R. maritima living leaves (i.e., LR) of different ages (juvenile, intermediate, and adult leaves; n = 9) originating from 3 bundles, as well as in leaf material (n = 9 leaf pieces) from R. maritima beach deposits (i.e., NR), as described by Kevrekidou et al. [16] (see also Supplementary File S1). The samples were observed under a Zeiss AxioImager Z.2 fluorescence microscope equipped with an MRc5 Axiocam. The cell fluorescence intensity was calculated with Image J software version 1.54 software (U. S. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) values were calculated according to the following equation:CTCF = integrated density − (area of selected cell × mean fluorescence of background readings)(1)
        Their mean values were calculated from 81 measurements for LR leaves, namely, three regions per leaf × three segments (apex, middle, base) per leaf × 9 leaves, and from 27 measurements for NR material (i.e., three regions per leaf piece × 9 leaf pieces).
      
      
        3.3. Assessment of the Activity of the Antioxidant Enzymes SOD-like and APX-like and Protein Content in Leaves from Living Plants (LR) and Beach Deposits (NR) of Ruppia maritima
        Three deep-freeze (−80 °C) leaf samples of both LR and NR materials were ground in liquid nitrogen. Each sample (100 mg wet weight) was treated in triplicate with 3 mL of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 0.1 mM of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 2% w/w of polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP), then centrifuged at 16,500 × g for 30 min at 4 °C.
        The protein content (mg/g w.w.) was measured spectrophotometrically using a PharmaSpec UV-1700 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan), according to the Bradford [100] method (see also Supplementary File S1).
        SOD-like activity (U/mg protein) was measured, as proposed by Beyer and Fridovich [101] (see also Supplementary File S1), and APX-like activity (U/mg protein) was measured according to Nakano et al. [102] (see Supplementary File S1). The activity of both enzymes was determined using a PharmaSpec UV-1700 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). The protein content of the samples was also used to normalize the values of SOD-like and APX-like activities.
      
      
        3.4. Preparation of Ruppia maritima Extracts
        We prepared the extracts from R. maritima living plants (LR) and beach deposits (NR), as previously described [16] (see also Supplementary File S1). The weight of the dried powder was measured to determine the percentage yield of the extraction process, using the following equation:Extraction yield (%) = [dry extract (g)/dry seaweed (g)] × 100(2)
        The extracts were kept at −20 °C until further use.
      
      
        3.5. Assessment of Phenolic Coompounds in Ruppia maritima Extracts
        The individual phenolic compounds in the LR and NR extracts were determined by UHPLC-DAD analysis as described previously [16] (see also Supplementary File S1). Identification and quantification of the individual phenolic compounds in all samples were based on the following standards: caftaric acid (purity > 97%, Sigma-Aldrich), chicoric acid (purity > 98%, Glentham, Corsham, UK), quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside (purity > 99%, Extrasynthese, Genay Cedex, France), caffeic acid (purity 99%, J&K Scientific, Shanghai, China), (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (purity 95%, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, NE, USA), p-coumaric acid (purity 98%, Sigma Aldrich), trans-ferulic acid (purity 99%, Sigma Aldrich), sinapic acid (purity 98%, Sigma Aldrich), rutin hydrate (purity > 94%, Sigma Aldrich), trans-cinnamic acid (purity 99%, Sigma Aldrich), hesperidin (purity 95%, Sigma Aldrich), and 4′,5,7-trihydroxyflavone (purity 97%, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, NE, USA) (see Supplementary File S1 for details). Subsequently, the standards were diluted in methanol at concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 200.00 mg/L to construct calibration curves (Supplementary File S1), and analyzed at 280, 270, 328, and 318 nm. The phenolic content of the extracts was analyzed at 7.0 mg/mL in methanol. Moreover, considering the extraction yield (%) of each extract, the phenolic compounds were also quantified in mg/g of d.w. of the initial LR and NR materials.
      
      
        3.6. Free Radical Scavenging Activity of Ruppia maritima Extracts
        We evaluated the ability of the extracts to scavenge free radicals in vitro using DPPH•, ABTS•+, OH•, and O2•− assays. All free radical scavenging assays were performed accordingly to one of our previous studies [103] and are described in detail in Supplementary File S1. In all assays, we evaluated the percentage of radical scavenging capacity (RSC) of the tested samples according to the following formula:RSC (%) = [(Acontrol − Asample)/Acontrol] × 100(3)
where Acontrol and Asample are the absorbance values of the control and the sample, respectively. The IC50 value, representing the concentration at which 50% of the free radical scavenging occurred, was calculated using a four-parameter logistic regression model with the ‘Quest Graph™ IC50 Calculator’ (AAT Bioquest, Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA) [104]. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control for the free radical scavenging activity. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and was repeated on at least three different occasions.
      
      
        3.7. Reducing Power (RP) Activity of Ruppia maritima Extracts
        Reducing power was assessed according to one of our previous studies [103] and is described in detail in Supplementary File S1. The RP0.5AU value, indicating the extract concentration that caused an absorbance of 0.5 at 700 nm, was determined using a four-parameter logistic regression model with the ‘Quest Graph™ IC50 Calculator’ [104]. Ascorbic acid was used as a positive control. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and was repeated on at least three different occasions.
      
      
        3.8. Cell Culture Conditions
        The human colon LS174 cancer cell line was obtained from ATCC company (Manassas, VA, USA). Human MSCs were obtained from the Wharton Jelly of umbilical cords from term-gestation newborns after birth, with consent obtained from the parents in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, as previously described [105]. LS174 cancer cells were cultured in normal Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibko, Paisley, UK). DMEM contained 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 units/mL of streptomycin (Gibko, Paisley, UK). MSCs were cultured in normal Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), high-glucose with stable glutamine and sodium pyruvate (BioWest, Miami, FL, USA), plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The cells were cultured in plastic disposable tissue culture flasks at 37 °C in 5% CO2.
      
      
        3.9. XTT Assay for Assessing the Inhibitory Activity of Ruppia maritima Extracts Against Cancer Cell Proliferation
        We assessed the inhibition of LS174 cancer cell proliferation using the XTT assay kit (Roche, Munich, Germany), which was performed according to one of our previous studies [103] (see also Supplementary File S1). For comparison purposes, we also tested extracts’ cytotoxic activity in normal human MSCs cells. The data were expressed as a percentage of inhibition using the following formula:Inhibition (%) = [(O.D.control − O.D.sample)/O.D.control] × 100(4)
where O.D.control and O.D.sample indicated the optical densities of the negative control and the tested extract, respectively. The IC50 value was calculated using a four-parameter logistic regression model with the ‘Quest Graph™ IC50 Calculator’ [104]. The anticancer drug doxorubicin was used as positive control. The experiment was conducted in triplicate and repeated at least three times.
      
      
        3.10. Statistical Analysis
        The results are expressed as mean ± standard error (mean ± S.E.) or mean ± standard deviation (mean ± S.D). For the free radical scavenging and XTT assays, the statistical analysis was based on one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s T3 test for multiple pair-wise comparisons. For CTCF values, antioxidant enzyme activities, and protein content, the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test was applied to determine the significant differences in the measured variables, as the primary analysis on both raw and log-transformed data indicated unequal variances. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. SPSS software (version 27.0; SPSS) was used for all statistical analyses.
      
    
    
      4. Conclusions
      The present study demonstrated for the first time that an extract from the living plants (i.e., LR) of the brackish water angiosperm R. maritima possesses significant antioxidant activity, although its inhibitory activity against colon cancer cell growth was not too strong. Since R. maritima ecosystems have significant ecological importance and are protected by international conventions, the collection of living plants to obtain bioactive extracts is recommended providing that acceptable management plans without adverse impacts are applied to its ecosystems. Alternatively, the development of cultivation methods for these plants is proposed for their sustainable exploitation. Additionally, the present results suggested for the first time the use of R. maritima beach deposits (i.e., NR) as an alternative source of the plant’s bioactive compounds. This approach would be less environmentally invasive than the use of the living plants, while always considering sustainable management programs for seagrass beach deposits. Thus, the results showed that R. maritima NR extract retained a significant antioxidant potency compared to the LR extract. Surprisingly, the R. maritima NR extract exhibited much better inhibitory activity against colon cancer cell growth than the LR extract. Moreover, chemical composition analysis by HPLC showed that both R. maritima LR and NR extracts contained phenolics such as chicoric acid, quercetin-3-O-glucopyranoside, p-coumaric acid, trans-ferulic acid, sinapic acid, rutin hydrate, trans-cinnamic acid, and caftaric acid, all of which are known to possess antioxidant and/or anticancer activity.
      Thus, the present findings indicate that R. maritima extracts from either LR or NR are a promising source of bioactive compounds that could be used for developing products beneficial to human health.

Body: 1
      Introduction
      Currently, there is growing attention to skin rejuvenation because of the increase in people's life expectancy [1]. Skin aging is a complicated process that includes intrinsic (chronological) aging and extrinsic aging (e.g., sun, gravity, sleeping positions, and smoking). In both types of aging, there is a decrease in elastin, collagen, and loss in hydration leading to dryness and atrophy, with fine wrinkling in the skin [2, 3]. Fibroblasts, the predominant population responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, are the primary cause of skin senescence [4, 5].
      So far, researchers have extensively studied skin rejuvenation and proposed strategies for reducing skin aging, one of which is nanotechnology. Recent research shows that Fe3O4@CQDs significantly reduce ROS and inhibit pro‐inflammatory cytokines like TNF‐α and IL‐1β, addressing oxidative damage and aging pathways [6, 7]. Studies indicate that nanotechnology enhances cosmetic effectiveness by increasing capture efficiency, controlling drug release, improving physical stability, increasing moisturization, and enhancing ultraviolet (UV) protection [8].
      As more people become interested in natural cosmetics, Oleuropein, a phenolic substance found in olive leaves (
Olea europaea
), has been shown to have multiple skin advantages in clinical studies [9, 10, 11]. This secoiridoid has a special ability to change how different mechanisms of skin aging interact, such as oxidative stress, inflammasome activation, and the degeneration of the ECM [12, 13]. Studies show that it is able to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower the levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines including IL‐1β and IL‐6, and boost collagen production through pathways that are mediated by VEGF [14, 15]. Oleuropein increases collagen synthesis and inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade skin collagen and elastin [10, 11].
      Also, studies have shown that vitamin C is one of the compounds that affects skin rejuvenation. Vitamin C neutralizes free radicals and increases collagen, but Oleuropein does better in the role of removing ROS [16] while also inhibiting IL‐1β and caspase‐1‐mediated inflammasome activation, which is associated with both oxidative stress and inflammation [16]. Oleuropein is stable in formulations, unlike vitamin C, which degrades quickly [17]. Based on research, Retinol enhances skin texture but induces inflammation and necessitates the avoidance of UV exposure, whereas Fe3O4@CQDs decrease inflammation without impairing barrier function, and their magnetic targeting minimizes systemic exposure [18, 19]. In contrast to hyaluronic acid or niacinamide, which disperse widely, Fe3O4@CQDs improve spatial accuracy by concentrating active ingredients in photoaged or inflammatory regions [8, 20, 21].
      Another strategy for decreasing skin aging is exosomes, which have recently attracted significant attention as a therapy for skin rejuvenation [22]. Exosomes, a category of skincare agents, are increasing in popularity in the cosmetics industry because of their therapeutic and rejuvenating characteristics. They contain proteins, lipids, nucleic acids like microRNAs, and other compounds, which promote healing, hydration, and skin health. Exosomes can be modified by manipulating the culture medium or cell content and can repair skin damage such as sunburn and acne scars. They also contain bioactive compounds that protect the skin from environmental influences and minimize dark spots [23, 24, 25, 26]. On the other hand, microRNAs are one of the most major molecules present in exosomes [27]. MicroRNAs have been shown to have various activities in skin aging after differentially expressed microRNAs were identified based on the results of microRNA sequence analysis [28].
      Recent clinical trials and research have shown that both unmodified and modified (engineered) exosomes, particularly those sourced from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and fibroblasts, are efficacious in skin rejuvenation, wound healing, and enhancement of barrier function [29, 30, 31]. Also, exosome‐based creams represent an innovative method in cosmetic dermatology, proving efficacy in skin rejuvenation, hydration, pigmentation correction, and wound healing [31, 32].
      Research findings suggest that multiple signaling pathways play a role in the process of skin aging. Insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a key protein that stimulates keratinocyte growth [4]. Many downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and MAPK, are phosphorylated as a result of IGF1 activation of the insulin‐like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) [33]. IGF1 activates the PI3PK/AKT pathway, prevents dermal fibroblasts from UV‐B‐induced programmed cell death, and promotes cell survival via the MAPK pathway [34]. Also, epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a mitogenic polypeptide. It can activate and multiply myofibroblasts through the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways [35, 36]. EGF has a bright future in cosmetic antiaging applications because it plays an important role in upregulating fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in the skin [37].
      The present study aimed to utilize modified exosomal content with treated Oleuropein and Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein to modulate the expression of genes (IGF1, IGF1R, EGF, COL1A1, and ELN) and microRNAs (hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, hsa‐let‐7e‐5p, and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p) related to IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K pathways on the HFFF2 cells (in vitro) in order to reduce the aging process in the skin.

Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein Synthesis
        Fe3O4 (Cas No 1309‐37‐1; US Research Nanomaterials Inc., USA) nanoparticles (1 g) and d‐glucose (0.5 g: a compound of carbon origin) were suspended in 60 mL of distilled water, and the suspension was sonicated for 30 min. Subsequently, using the hydrothermal method, the suspension was incubated at 180°C for 5 h to synthesize Fe3O4@CQD in the Hydrothermal Autoclave. Thereafter, the synthesized Fe3O4@CQD was separated by centrifugation at 2000 g for min. After washing with water and ethanol, the samples were dried using a freeze dryer. In the following, 1 g of dried Fe3O4@CQD and 0.1 g of Oleuropein (32619‐42‐4; Sigma‐Aldrich, Germany) were suspended in 50 mL of distilled water and stirred by a shaker for 24 h to make Fe3O4@CQD/Oleuropein. Finally, the Fe@C/Ole NPs were gathered, washed, and dried using a freeze dryer.

          The synthesized Fe@C/Ole and functional groups of the particles were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy. The assay was carried out using an FTIR (SHIMADZU, Japan) device in a wave range of 500–4000 cm−1. X‐ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to assess the physical phase and crystal structure of Fe@C/Ole (CuKα, radiation, λ = 0.154056) at a scanning speed of 2° per minute (2θ range from 10° to 80°). Additionally, the size range, morphology, and aggregation level of the synthesized Fe@C/Ole were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (TESCAN MiRa3).

        Cell Culture
        Human umbilical cord mesenchymal cells (hUC‐MSCs) were cultured according to Maleki et al. method [38]. Also, the fibroblast cell line (HFFF2) was purchased from the National Cell Bank of Iran (NCBI; Pasteur Institute, Tehran, Iran). Cell culture was performed using LG‐DMEM (Biosera, France), 10% FBS (Gibco, USA), Pen/Strep 100 μg/mL (Biosera, France), and then hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were incubated in 96% humidity containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were subcultured respectively after 80% and 90% confluency using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Gibco, USA).
      
      
        2.3
        Cell Viability Assay (MTT Assay)
        hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells suspensions were seeded in a 96‐well culture plate, and after incubation for 24 h, hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were treated with a gradient concentration of Fe@C/Ole (0–1000 μg/mL) and Ole (0–2000 μg/mL). The plates were incubated for 24 and 48 h. Next, the medium was removed, and MTT (2‐(4,5‐dimethythiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added. After incubation for 4 h, the contents of the wells were removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the wells (the assay was repeated three times). The IC50 and IC25 were calculated by measuring the absorbance of the formazan crystals at a wavelength of 570 nm (Awareness Microwell Plate Reader Chromate 4300, USA).

          2.5.1
          Exosomes Isolation
          The cell culture supernatants were collected and transferred into centrifuge microtubes after 24 h of treatment with Fe@C/Ole and Ole. We extracted exosomes from exosomes isolated from cell cultures by ultracentrifugation using optimized protocols (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). In summary, the supernatants were centrifuged in the following order: 300 g, 2000 g, 10 min each, at 4°C, and 10 000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatants obtained were ultracentrifuged at 100 000 g for 90 min at 4°C. Next, the pellets were resuspended in PBS and ultracentrifuged at 100 000 g for 90 min at 4°C. Finally, the pellets were resuspended in 500 μL of PBS and stored at −80°C.

            Isolated hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes (500 μL) and HFFF2‐derived exosomes resuspended in PBS were lysed in a lysis buffer. After centrifuging at 12 000 g for 12 min at 4°C, the supernatant containing protein was extracted and stored in a freezer at −20°C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay. Quantified proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Thermo Scientific, USA) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA (Roche, Germany) for 2 h and then incubated with primary antibodies against CD63 (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐5275), CD9 (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐18 869), and β‐actin (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐47 778) for 18 h. After washing, the membranes were incubated for 1:15 h 15 min with a secondary anti‐rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐2357). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used to detect the bands, and ImageJ software was used for analysis.

        Flow Cytometry (Exosome Toxicity Investigation)
        Cells were harvested and stained with DAPI 10X (4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole). All tests were performed in triplicate. The cell cycle and apoptosis progression were measured using an automated multicolor Flow Cytometry system. Flow Cytometry results were evaluated using FlowJo software (version 10). Flow Cytometry was used to measure the apoptosis rate in the HFFF2 cells treated with hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes and HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups. The HFFF2 cells were treated with two different concentrations of exosomes: 5.71 μg/mL (Bradford assay concentration) for HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups, and 6.088 μg/mL (Bradford assay concentration) for hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups.

        Physicochemical Properties of Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein
        The FT‐IR spectra of Fe3O4, Ole, Fe3O4@CQD, and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole are shown in Figure 1. The functional groups of the synthesized nanoparticles were identified. The strong band at 3350–3500 cm−1 confirmed the O‐H stretching bond of the phenolic part of Ole and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole. The peaks at approximately 500–600 cm−1 correspond to Fe‐O bonding, confirming the presence of Fe3O4 in the structures of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CQD, and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole. Fe3O4@CQD and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole exhibited a C=O stretching band at 1710 cm−1, signifying the presence of Fe3O4‐CQD. C–H stretching vibration signals were observed at 2920 cm−1. The characteristic vibration of the carbonyl groups in the Ole molecule was responsible for the signals observed at 1720 cm−1. The signal appeared at 1597 cm−1 as a stretching vibration and 1386 cm−1 as a bending vibration belonging to the functional groups C = C and O‐H, respectively. These results indicated the presence of Ole in Fe3O4@CQD/Ole (Figure 1A). The XRD pattern of Oleuropein attached to magnetite nanoparticles. All the signals in this pattern match the information from the standard XRD pattern of magnetite nanoparticles and confirm the crystallinity of the nanoparticles (Figure 1B). Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a spherical spinel structure showed signals at (311), (220), (440), (511), (422), and (400). The absence of (110) (2θ = 21.220) and (104) (2θ = 33.150) signals indicates that neither goethite (α‐FeOOH) nor hematite (α‐Fe2O3) phases were formed in the samples. Additionally, the binding of Oleuropein does not change the structure of Fe3O4@CQD; a broad peak is observed between 2θ = 12–28, which pertains to the overlap between Oleuropein and Fe3O4@CQD (Figure 1B). The morphology and size of the nanoparticles were determined using field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FE‐SEM) technique. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the sample revealed a range of particle sizes, ranging from 30 to 80 nm. Therefore, the image illustrates that the particles of the sample ingredients exhibited a high degree of homogeneity and possessed a consistent, symmetrical, and uniform distribution (Figure 1C).

        Viability Percentage (MTT Assay)
        Fe@C/Ole was evaluated as a conductive particle in terms of cell viability (Figure 3A), and the IC50 for the HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs was 484.52 and 511 μg/mL, respectively. Cell treatment was performed using IC25 ≃ 250 μg/mL, although cell growth inhibition was also observed in this treatment.
        
          FIGURE 3

        The effects of different concentrations of Ole on the viability of HFFF2 and hUC‐MSCs were studied (Figure 3B). The amount of the IC50 was estimated at 1035.4 μg/mL for the HFFF2 cells and 977.43 μg/mL for hUC‐MSCs; cell treatment was performed utilizing IC25 ≃ 500 μg/mL for cell treatment as an effective concentration. In summary, the results showed that Ole has cell inhibition and toxicity in very high concentrations (IC50 ≃ 1000 μg/mL), whereas Fe@C/Ole has them in low concentrations (IC25 ≃ 500 μg/mL).

          The exosomes isolated size from hUC‐MSCs treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and the control group were 68.8 ± 4.82, 58.3 ± 4.49, and 41.3 ± 3.03 nm, respectively, and the exosomes isolated size from HFFF2 cells treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and the control group were 67.3 ± 4.80, 42.6 ± 3.04, and 35.5 ± 2.82, respectively in the DLS analyses (Figures S1 and S2; Table 1). Z‐potential of the isolated exosomes was found to be −21.8 and −21.3 mV, which indicates the stability of exosomes in hUC‐MSCs treated with Ole and HFFF2 treated with Ole, respectively (Figure S3).

          Western Blot Analysis
          In the western blot image, protein bands with a size of 26 kDa indicated exosome membrane protein CD63 (Figure 4A,B). The protein CD63 was present in the Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups in both the hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells. Furthermore, the presence of protein bands at 24 kDa implies the existence of the exosome membrane protein CD9, as depicted in Figure 4C,D. We detected CD9 protein in the hUC‐MSCs, HFFF2 cells, and control group.

          The Relative Gene Expression Treated With Fe@C/Ole and Ole
          In the ANOVA test, significant differences were observed between the treatments (Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control) in the HFFF2 cells, in terms of the relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes (p ≤ 0.05). Also, in the hUC‐MSCs, there was a significant difference in the relative expression (p ≤ 0.05) of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A, and ELN genes between the treatments. In contrast to other genes, no significant difference was observed in the relative gene expression of EGF in the hUC‐MSCs between the treatments (Table S3).
          The HFFF2 cells exhibited significant upregulation in the expression of the IGF1 (fold change: 3.14), IGF1R (5.3), COL1A1 (2.11), ELN (3.17), and EGF (3.5) genes in response to Ole treatment compared to the control group. Additionally, Fe@C/Ole treatment upregulated the expression of the IGF1R (2.03), ELN (1.94), and EGF (2.76) genes compared with the control group; however, there were no significant changes in the IGF1 and COL1A1 genes in the Fe@C/Ole group compared with the control group (Figure 5A). This trend of gene expression changes was similar in hUC‐MSCs, although, as mentioned, the EGF gene was not significant, and, unlike the HFFF2 cells, the COL1A1 gene was upregulated in the Fe@C/Ole treatment (Figure 5B).

          The Relative Gene Expression in Exosome‐Treated HFFF2 Cells
          According to the qRT‐PCR data and analysis of variance, there was a significant difference between HFFF2‐derived exosomes and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control treatments in terms of the relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes (p ≤ 0.05) in HFFF2 cells (Table S4).
          The findings indicated that the relative expression levels of IGF1 (2.6, 6.14), IGF1R (3.02, 6.11), COL1A1(3.73, 4.25), ELN (2.5, 3.25), and EGF (4.06, 4.14) were strongly upregulated in the HFFF2 cells treated with HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes with Ole compared to the control group, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Also, the results showed that the relative expression levels of IGF1 (3.4, 5.62), IGF1R (3.9, 6.02), COL1A1 (2.24, 3.32), ELN (2.4, 3.4), and EGF (3.61, 4.12) were significantly upregulated in the HFFF2 cells after the treatment of HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes with Fe@C/Ole compared to the control group, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Overall, the effects of HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes were similar; however, the effect of exosome treatment on gene expression was more significant than that of direct treatment with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to the control group.

The results showed that hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs were significantly downregulated, whereas miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated in HFFF2‐derived exosome content, as well as in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosome content treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to the control (Figure 7A,B).

The present study evaluated the amounts of different microRNAs in HFFF2 cells treated with HFFF2‐derived exosomes and in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes in comparison to the control. The results indicated that the hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs were downregulated in HFFF2 cells between the treatments. In contrast, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated between treatments in HFFF2 cells (Figure 8A,B).

          Expression Correlation of microRNAs

          Our investigation demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the expression levels of specific microRNAs in modified exosomal content and the associated alterations in HFFF2 cells treated with these exosomes. This finding supports the concept that exosomal miRNAs are conveyed to recipient cells and influence their gene expression.
          The study examined expression correlation of several microRNAs, including hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p, in HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to exosomes of HFFF2 cells that were treated with exosomes derived from these cells. Significant positive correlations were consistently observed for these microRNAs in exosomes and exosomes of HFFF2 cells, indicating a robust influence on HFFF2 cellular responses. These results highlight the critical role of exosomes in intercellular communication and the regulation of gene expression within recipient cells (Table S7).

        The Flow Cytometry analysis results showed no significant variations in the viability percentage between HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, or the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 9). Flow Cytometry analysis of cell death data, including late apoptosis and necrosis, revealed no significant differences between exosome treatments. However, the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole significantly increased early apoptosis (p ≤ 0.05); on the other hand, there were no significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in early apoptosis between the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Ole and the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 9).

      Discussion
      Previous research has revealed that the IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways are involved in skin rejuvenation [34, 35, 36, 37]. For these signaling pathways, we selected to investigate growth factors and their receptors, including the IGF1, IGF1R, and EGF genes, as well as the COL1A1 and ELN genes, which are primarily involved in skin renewal. Conversely, microRNAs modulate gene expression in the skin aging process. Research has identified multiple microRNAs linked to skin aging, which also target our chosen genes, notably the hsa‐miR‐29, hsa‐miR‐34, and hsa‐let‐7 families [49]. Research has shown that IGF1 is regulated by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [39] and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [40]; IGF1R is targeted by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [41], hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [42], hsa‐let‐7d‐5p [43], and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p [43]; EGF is regulated by hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [44]; COL1A1 is targeted by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [45], hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [46], and hsa‐let‐7d‐5p [47]; and ELN is regulated by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [48].
      Aging causes an increase in MMPs and a reduction in Collagen (COL1A1) and Elastin (ELN) levels [50, 51]. Thus, enhancing the production of Collagen (COL1A1) and Elastin (ELN) can effectively mitigate the effects of aging and promote rejuvenation [51, 52]. This study revealed that Ole and Fe@C/Ole (slow release) treatments increased COL1A1 and ELN mRNA levels in HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs that support the hypothesis of skin rejuvenation through treatments, as MMP9 (nonreported) has the ability to degrade collagen and elastin. Results were anticipated given the proven efficacy of Ole in many signaling pathways, including IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K [13, 53]. The effect of Ole can be attributed to its antioxidant effects, as well as its influence on the expression of growth factors such as IGF1 and EGF [10, 54, 55]. Generally, in our study, Ole treatment upregulated the expression of IGF1, EGF, and IGF1R, but IGF1 was not significant in Fe@C/Ole treatment (Figures 5 and 6). To date, reports have shown that antioxidant treatments, such as Ole, quercetin, and resveratrol, increase the expression of IGF1, EGF, and IGF1R genes [56, 57].
      The nanocomposite structure can improve Ole's stability and activity by preventing degradation in biological fluids. This is crucial for maintaining therapeutic levels during treatment [58]. Ole's effect on enhancing these growth factors and their receptors has been examined by targeting the MAPK signaling pathway [53, 59], which supports the rejuvenation process by inhibiting MMPs and promoting the production of COL1A1 and ELN (Figure 11). Furthermore, previous studies have highlighted Ole's ability to activate the PI3K signaling pathway and its significant antioxidant effects [60]. This pathway is known for its antioxidant properties; by increasing the expression of antioxidant cascades within the cell's nucleus and mitochondria, it actively inhibits the aging process [61]. Additionally, reducing MMP activity and blocking inflammatory pathways—such as those involving prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), nitric oxide (NO), and interleukin 6 (IL‐6)—promotes the synthesis of collagen (COL1) and elastin (ELN) (Figure 11).

      In fact, our investigation involved treating HFFF2 cells with exosomes derived from both HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs, all of which had been pre‐treated with either Ole or Fe@C/Ole. This approach led to an observable increase in the expression of several key genes: IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF (Figure 11). This outcome aligns generally with findings from direct Ole therapy, with the notable exception of the EGF gene's response in hUC‐MSCs. Interestingly, whereas direct treatment of HFFF2 cells with Fe@C/Ole did not significantly alter the expression of IGF1 and COL1A1 and similarly for EGF and IGF1 in hUC‐MSCs, a significant upregulation was observed when these cells were instead treated with exosomes originating from HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs that had undergone Fe@C/Ole pre‐treatment. This suggests that the reduced toxicity of Fe@C/Ole when delivered via exosomes appears to have notably increased gene expression within the exosomes themselves, a significant improvement compared to direct application. Utilizing modified exosomal content offers distinct benefits over conventional treatments. Primarily, these modified exosomes do not trigger the body's antibody and antigen systems, thus avoiding an immune response. Secondly, their internal components are directly influenced by the initial treatment, as these exosomes are typically derived from living cells [22, 62]. Furthermore, both Ole therapy and Fe@C/Ole application substantially altered the makeup of the exosomes, leading to observable changes in their modified content. Exosomes also exhibit remarkable anti‐inflammatory properties, which contribute to accelerated healing, a reduced risk of EGF complications such as post‐inflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring, and improved results in photo rejuvenation by enhancing collagenases and promoting the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts [63, 64].
      On the other hand, this investigation focused on microRNAs linked to genes involved in the IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways. We assessed how Ole and Fe@C/Ole treatments affected the levels of exosomal microRNAs in HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs, given their known association with growth factors and genes critical for skin rejuvenation. The findings indicated that a 24‐h treatment influenced the expression levels of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs in exosomes. The changes in Ole and Fe@C/Ole treatments resulted in the downregulation of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs in exosomes derived from HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs. Downregulation of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs as interfering RNAs justified the upregulation of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF gene expression (Table 2). These observations were corroborated by the expression of the aforementioned genes within HFFF2 cells, subsequent to their treatment with HFFF2‐derived exosomes that had undergone pre‐treatment with Ole and Fe@C/Ole (Figure 6). This research demonstrates a clear alignment between the microRNA levels found within the exosomes and those present in the HFFF2 recipient cells influenced by these exosomes. Consequently, modified exosomal content, produced through Ole and Fe@C/Ole therapy, emerges as a practical substitute for directly treating cells. These tiny vesicles hold considerable benefits when compared to traditional topical facial applications, positioning them as a more effective therapeutic choice [65, 66].
      Unexpectedly, overexpression of hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p in exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole and also exosomes of HFFF2 cells that were treated with exosomes derived from these cells indicates a complex role in skin aging responses. It enhances skin repair by promoting cell turnover and healthier epidermal layers, regulates oncogene‐suppressing pathways to prevent skin deterioration, and induces apoptosis to clear damaged cells, supporting new cell generation. Additionally, it modulates genes vital for tissue repair, boosting collagen and elastin synthesis for improved skin youthfulness. These effects collectively enhance skin self‐renewal, underscoring its potential in antiaging research [67, 68, 69, 70].
      This study provides novel insights into the regenerative properties of modified exosomal contents, indicating that Ole and Fe@C/Ole in exosome‐based therapies hold great promise for skin rejuvenation. In addition, this study offers important insights into the effects of Ole and Fe@C/Ole on cellular mechanisms, and it is important to understand that the experiments were performed in vitro using cell lines. Applying these findings to in vivo conditions, such as human skin, could require more studies. The intricacies of the human body, including factors such as skin thickness and blood circulation, may affect the efficacy and potential side effects of Ole or Fe@C/Ole‐based treatments.

      Conclusion
      The research findings indicate that the use of modified exosomal content with Ole and Fe@C/Ole (slow release) treatment is a more effective method for transferring substances and biomolecules that are effective in the molecular mechanisms of skin rejuvenation than the use of effective substance treatment alone in vitro. This method can ultimately increase collagen and elastin gene expression while reducing interfering microRNAs in their respective genes.

Title: Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Association with Ulcerative Proctitis: Surgical Management in a Refractory Case to Topical and Systemic Treatment

Abstract: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a challenging dermatological condition, can be described as a chronic, painful, follicular, occlusive disease that is characterized by painful nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts generally located in the intertriginous skin areas. This disorder places a considerable burden on affected individuals and often leads to significant impairment in quality of life for those grappling with its persistent and recurrent nature. We present the case of a 20-year-old male patient known to have ulcerative proctitis and diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2020, for which he underwent various topical and systemic treatments, with periods of remission and recurrent flares without managing to obtain complete remission of HS. In our dermatology service, the patient underwent two surgical unroofing procedures combined with punch debridement, with the wounds being allowed to heal by secondary intention. This choice of treatment delivered great results with favorable outcomes, without recurrence of the lesions, proving to be an effective method for managing HS. By presenting this case, we underline the role of surgical procedures in managing HS, and our desire is to emphasize the importance of comprehensive understanding of this enigmatic and complex condition for more effective management strategies in patients with refractory disease.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Hidradenitis suppurativa, also known as acne inversa [1], stands as a dermatological enigma characterized by the chronic and debilitating nature of its inflammatory skin lesions. HS is a chronic follicular occlusive disease affecting the follicular portion of the folliculopilosebaceous units (FPSUs), characterized by the development of painful nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts, that places a considerable burden on affected individuals [2]. This disorder primarily affects the intertriginous areas, such as the axillae, groin, and buttocks, and often leads to significant impairment in quality of life for those grappling with its persistent and recurrent nature [3].
      The epidemiology of HS is a dynamic landscape, with estimates suggesting a prevalence of approximately 1% in the general population [4]. However, this prevalence might be underestimated due to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis, underscoring the need for heightened clinical awareness. HS typically emerges in early adulthood, presenting a peak onset in the second and third decades of life. The gender predilection is notable, with a higher prevalence in females, although the disease’s severity may be more pronounced in males [5].
      The pathogenesis of HS involves a multifaceted interplay of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. Current evidence suggests a polygenic inheritance, with mutations in genes associated with inflammation, innate immunity, and the follicular epithelium contributing to disease susceptibility. Dysregulation of the immune response, particularly involving the interleukin pathway, plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory cascades observed in HS [6].
      The probable instigating factor for the initial formation of HS lesions is follicular occlusion, which stems from the proliferation of ductal keratinocytes, resulting in follicular hyperkeratosis and blockage. It is suggested that associated factors within this process are the hormones and nicotine, which have a negative impact on the follicular epithelium. The resulting anoxia within the follicular duct, induced by follicular epithelial hyperplasia, contributes to the disturbance of the usual terminal differentiation of follicular keratinocytes, obstructing the follicular passage and subsequent follicular rupture [7]. 
      The occlusion of hair follicles, subsequent inflammation, and bacterial colonization contribute to the formation of abscesses and sinus tracts characteristic of HS lesions. Skin tunnels that have been firmly established ultimately emerge onto the surface of the skin, undergoing persistent inflammation. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, and poor diet further exacerbate the disease, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the disease’s pathophysiology [8]. Furthermore, several studies indicate a correlation between HS and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [9], both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) [10], as they exhibit some similarities to HS regarding clinical manifestations, genetic predisposition, and immunological characteristics.
      Regarding its clinical manifestation, hidradenitis suppurativa unfolds with painful, inflamed nodules that may progress to abscesses and sinus tracts. These lesions predominantly manifest in intertriginous areas, including the axillae (most common site), inguinal area, inframammary, and perianal regions. The formation of skin tunnels, clusters of exposed comedones (referred to as tombstone comedones), and scarring are outcomes observed in cases of recurring or persistent disease. The disease course is generally marked by recurrent flares and remission periods, which contribute to its chronic nature [11]. 
      Disease onset typically occurs post-puberty, often in the second and third decades of life, and there is a correlation between the earlier onset of HS and a more extensive and widespread disease [12]. Furthermore, diagnosis of the condition is often delayed, especially in cases categorized as ‘mild’ and intermittent, the primary inflammatory nodules being commonly misdiagnosed as furuncles [13]. On top of that, the lack of a specific diagnostic test demands a meticulous clinical assessment for the diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa. The diagnosis relies on the presence of typical lesions, typical topography, and chronicity and recurrences [2]. Diagnostic criteria, including the Hurley staging system and the International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4), aid in categorizing disease severity and guiding treatment decisions. 
      The Hurley clinical staging system is commonly employed to categorize patients with HS into three levels of disease severity: Stage I: formation of abscesses (single or multiple) without skin tunnels or cicatrization/scarring; Stage II: recurrent abscesses accompanied by skin tunnels and scarring, with single or multiple lesions widely separated; and Stage III: widespread or nearly widespread involvement, or the presence of multiple interconnected skin tunnels and abscesses across the entire affected area [14]. The majority of HS patients typically fall under stage I disease [15].
      IHS4 represents a validated instrument for dynamically evaluating the severity of hidradenitis suppurativa. IHS4 is determined by tallying the number of nodules (multiplied by 1), abscesses (multiplied by 2), and draining tunnels (multiplied by 4). A cumulative score of 3 or below indicates mild disease, 4–10 denotes moderate severity, and 11 or higher indicates severe HS [16]. By incorporating these criteria, IHS4 offers clinicians a standardized framework for assessing and monitoring HS severity, facilitating improved treatment decisions and patient management strategies.
      Managing hidradenitis suppurativa necessitates a nuanced, multimodal approach, reflecting the chronic and relapsing nature of the disease. Lifestyle modifications, encompassing weight loss and smoking cessation, emerge as foundational pillars of disease management [17]. The severity of the disease has a significant impact on the approach to treatment. 
      In milder cases (Hurley stage I), therapy aims to reduce the burden of the disease (i.e., to limit the development of lesions and inhibit the progression of the disease) and to improve acute, symptomatic lesions. The treatment consists of topical and systemic antibiotics that target bacterial colonization, mitigating inflammation [18]. Although the initial therapy in these cases consists generally of oral tetracyclines, topical clindamycin is occasionally considered and might serve as a viable initial approach for individuals with mild disease. Oral antiandrogenic medications and metformin represent supplementary treatment choices that can be employed independently or in combination with antibiotics. Further measures for managing symptomatic inflamed nodules encompass intralesional corticosteroid injections, punch debridement (partial unroofing), and the application of topical resorcinol [19].
      A spectrum of interventions comes into play for moderate to severe disease (Hurley stage II or III). Oral antibiotic therapy, intralesional corticosteroid injections, systemic immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies—the latter targeting specific inflammatory pathways—showcase efficacy in controlling disease progression. Furthermore, surgical options, including drainage of abscesses, surgical unroofing, and excision of involved tissue, prove beneficial in refractory cases, although necessitating carefully weighing risks and benefits [20].
      In this case report we present the case of a 20-year-old male known to have ulcerative proctitis and diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2020, for which he underwent two surgical interventions of incision and drainage in another service, various topical treatments (clindamycin 1% solution, resorcinol 15% cream and topical antiseptic washes), and systemic treatments (oral doxycycline), with periods of remission, recurrent flares and persistent worsening of symptoms in recent months. This case report will outline the surgical treatment options chosen, the decisions made, and the subsequent outcome for our patient. By presenting this case, our intention is to underscore the significance of possessing a thorough understanding of this intricate condition. Such understanding is pivotal in devising more effective management strategies, especially for patients grappling with refractory disease.

      In 2015, the patient received a diagnosis of mild ulcerative proctitis and underwent a four-week treatment regimen of topical mesalamine at a daily dose of 1 g, leading to subsequent remission of the disease. Since then, there has been a single episode of disease relapse, effectively managed with topical mesalamine without the necessity for ongoing maintenance therapy.
      The onset of HS symptoms occurred three years before. Since then, the patient has undergone a range of treatments: two surgical interventions of incision and drainage in another service, various topical treatments (clindamycin 1% solution, one application per day, resorcinol 15% cream, one application per day, and topical antiseptic washes) and systemic treatments (oral doxycycline 50 mg once daily for three months), with periods of remission and recurrent flares, without managing to obtain the complete remission of the disease.
      At the current presentation, the dermatological clinical exam reveals typical lesions of HS located in both of the patient’s axillae. In the left axilla, we observed two skin tunnels, one inflammatory nodule, and a thick, linear, rope-like band of scarring (Figure 1a). On the other hand, in the right axilla, we described one solitary skin tunnel and two deep-seated inflamed nodules with minimal scarring (Figure 1b). Following the extent and severity of lesions, the patient was classified as having Hurley stage II disease and an IHS4 score of 15. 
      In instances where the prevention of new lesions proves unsuccessful and medical therapy for established and growing lesions is ineffective, surgery becomes the acknowledged approach for managing hidradenitis suppurativa. Considering this, in the current context of our patient’s presentation, we opted for the surgical management of the axillary lesions.
      Initially, we conducted the surgical treatment of lesions localized in the left axilla under localized anesthesia using lidocaine 1% (Figure 2a). We performed the surgical unroofing of two skin tunnels (Figure 2b) and the punch debridement of one inflammatory nodule (Figure 2c). The punch debridement procedure utilized a 5 mm circular punch instrument to excise the isolated inflammatory nodule, along with a minimal amount of surrounding tissue. 
      In the context of the surgical unroofing technique, the procedure commenced with the delineation of the affected area followed by local anesthesia administration (adrenaline was utilized to prolong the duration of action). Due to the absence of a discernible sinus tract opening, a surgical entry point was established through the overlying skin. A guiding probe was introduced through the surgical entry point and meticulously navigated along the entire length of the sinus tract. Subsequently, an incision was made along the probe’s trajectory, resulting in the detachment of the upper portion of the sinus tract. The entire roof of each tract was meticulously excised, and both the base and margins were explored for concealed entrances to other tunnels. Cellular debris at the base of the tract was debrided, along with any superficial scar tissue and granulation tissue, thereby aiding in the elimination of the biofilm lining the tunnel. Superficial curettage resulted in a uniform, bleeding lesion bed at the subcutaneous level.
      After the procedures, the wounds were allowed to heal by secondary intention (Figure 2d), using just some dressing pads with a silicone wound contact layer. Following the intervention, the patient was prescribed a course of antibiotic therapy consisting of Cefuroxime 500 mg, taken twice daily for a duration of 5 days. The patient was given detailed instructions regarding the wound care regimen to be followed at home, which involved gently cleansing the area with an antiseptic solution, followed by the application of a moist dressing containing a neutral ointment, and sealing with a superabsorbent silicon-lined dressing. The patient diligently followed this home care protocol for 2 weeks. After the follow-up assessment, we advised the patient to apply another ointment with antibacterial and scar-reducing properties, containing silver sulfadiazine. 
      The patient attended follow-up appointments at two weeks (Figure 3a) and four weeks (Figure 3b) post operation, demonstrating a favorable progression of the lesions with no indication of inflammation or infection.
      Subsequently, we performed the surgical management of the lesions localized in the right axilla, performing the surgical unroofing of one skin tunnel and the punch debridement of two inflammatory nodules (Figure 4a), leaving the wounds to heal by secondary intention (Figure 4b). The patient attended follow-up appointments at two weeks (Figure 4c) and four weeks (Figure 4d) post-operation, also showing a favorable evolution. Six months post intervention, the patient is in total remission without any new HS lesions in the axillary region or any other areas. 
    
    
      3. Discussion
      Several risk factors have been statistically established as contributing to the development of hidradenitis suppurativa. Factors such as genetic susceptibility, mechanical stresses on the skin, obesity, smoking, dietary habits, and hormonal influences are frequently mentioned as potential contributors linked to the onset or worsening of HS. Our case diverges, as the patient lacked any of these factors mentioned. He was a non-smoker with a normal BMI, maintained a healthy dietary habit, and had no familial history of genetic susceptibility to the condition.
      Most notably, our patient was known to have mild ulcerative proctitis, diagnosed in 2015 and, at presentation, in clinical remission after the treatment with topical mesalamine. Several studies indicate a correlation between hidradenitis suppurativa and inflammatory bowel disease [9]. Earlier research suggested that the association between HS and IBD was present only in Crohn’s disease [21], with no apparent link to hidradenitis suppurativa in ulcerative colitis [22]. However, this notion has since been disproved, as subsequent studies are increasingly revealing a correlation between HS and ulcerative colitis as well. The most recent study is that of Bingzhou Bao et al., in 2023; theirs was a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study proving a robust causal relationship between IBD of both subtypes (CD and UC) and HS [23]. Concerning the pathophysiological aspect, there is some evidence indicating that IBD and HS share common clinical manifestations [24], genetic predisposition, and immunological profiles [22]; however, further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of the causal connection between IBD and HS.
      As far as treatment is concerned, our patient underwent a variety of interventions to manage the disease. He reported having undergone two surgical procedures involving incision and drainage in another service but experienced a swift recurrence of the lesions. Currently, it has been demonstrated that the customary practice of incision and drainage (I&D) for individual nodules is deemed ineffective and unsuitable for managing hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) [25]. I&D offers only temporary relief, and as it fails to address the actively growing tissue, lesions treated in this manner often experience recurrence [26].
      Our patient was classified as having Hurley stage II disease. In this stage of HS, the primary therapeutic strategy to reduce the disease burden involves using oral antibiotics, typically oral tetracyclines or a combination of oral clindamycin and rifampin [27]. Our patient had previously undergone a three-month course of oral doxycycline at a daily dosage of 50 mg, yielding no substantial improvement in the lesions. Typically, doxycycline is prescribed at a recommended dosage of 100 mg, administered once to twice daily [28]. The suboptimal response to the treatment observed in our patient could be attributed to the lower dosage employed during the course. 
      On the other hand, for the treatment of acute, symptomatic lesions, additional interventions are necessary that may consist of intralesional corticosteroid injections [29], punch debridement, unroofing [30], and topical resorcinol [31]. For our patient, intermittent use of topical resorcinol 15% cream was employed to address newly inflamed nodules, resulting in temporary alleviation of pain; however, unfortunately, upon discontinuation of the medication there was a rapid recurrence of symptoms. In our case, the various topical and systemic treatments resulted in periods of remission and recurrent flares without obtaining a complete remission of the disease. In this instance, there are alternative medical treatment options to consider, including biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors like adalimumab [32] and infliximab [33], the interleukin (IL) 17A inhibitor secukinumab [34], and oral acitretin (for patients not of childbearing potential) [27]. However, these treatments were not deemed necessary in our case as the lesions were localized, and the patient was considered suitable for surgical management of the disease.
      A diverse array of surgical techniques are employed in the treatment of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. These methods can be customized based on factors such as disease stage, defect size, bacterial contamination level, anatomical location, and the consideration of scar placement and potential for revision. The most-used surgical techniques are punch debridement with a 5 to 7 mm punch biopsy instrument and surgical unroofing, which involves removal of the superficial portion of the lesion [35] followed by closure by secondary intention [36]; these techniques were also used in our case. For more severe cases, extensive excision may be necessary to address a region affected by chronic or widespread hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage III) when conservative medical and surgical interventions prove ineffective [37]. 
      In our case, the surgical intervention yielded outstanding results. At the moment, more than six months post surgical treatment, the patient remains free of any recurrence of lesions. This affirms the effectiveness of surgical methods as an impactful approach for managing moderate-stage hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage II). This strategy proves particularly advantageous for patients with inflammatory nodules and skin tunnels that do not respond to traditional topical or systemic therapies.
    
    
      4. Conclusions
      Based on a thorough case analysis, the patient under consideration exhibited no apparent common risk factors for developing HS, with the only noteworthy association being the diagnosis of ulcerative proctitis. This correlation underscores the complexity of the disease and highlights the interplay of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors in the development of this disorder. Despite being unresponsive to initial topical and systemic therapy, the patient responded remarkably well to the surgical management of the disease. The present case underlines the importance of surgical procedures in managing moderate-stage hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage II). This comprehensive exploration, spanning the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, staging, diagnosis, and most of all the surgical treatment of HS, underscores the importance of thoroughly understanding this complex condition for a more effective management strategy, especially in patients with refractory disease. As we navigate the intricacies of HS, a better patient-centered approach emerges, promising improved outcomes and enhanced quality of life for those grappling with this enigmatic condition.

Title: What Patients Don’t Say and Physicians Don’t Ask: A Needs Assessment in Myasthenia Gravis Integrating Patient and Healthcare Professional Perspectives

Abstract: IntroductionMyasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare, autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by unpredictable fluctuating muscle weakness. This unpredictability makes effective patient–healthcare professional (HCP) dialogue essential for optimal diagnosis and management, with communication as a key component of shared decision-making (SDM). We designed a needs assessment to understand the differences between HCP and patient communication needs and perspectives on the impact of MG.MethodsA mixed-methods approach was utilized, comprising a survey and semi-structured interviews with HCPs and patients with MG. Quantitative data from the survey were extracted and analyzed to understand trends of knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward patient–HCP dialogue and SDM in MG. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using principles of thematic analysis to identify perspectives on the impact of MG and challenges in communication.ResultsCompleted survey data were collected from 47 HCPs and 122 patients. There were discrepancies and areas of alignment in the priorities each group placed on knowledge, skills, and attitudes in MG management. Patients valued HCPs’ listening skills and knowledge of treatment history, whereas HCPs prioritized knowing what matters to a patient with MG, including providing support to the patient and their family/carer. Both groups agreed on the necessity of a compassionate and informed approach to care. Interviews (10 HCPs; 10 patients) revealed key themes, including the multifaceted way in which symptoms impact patients’ lives and challenges patients face while communicating their experiences.ConclusionThis needs assessment indicated general alignment between patients and HCPs on MG symptoms; however, notable disparities were found in relation to the perceived impact of these symptoms on patients’ lives, and communication. While some HCPs expected patients to volunteer information on symptoms and MG-related challenges, patients expected their HCPs to ask. This highlights a need for improved communication strategies, which will foster SDM approaches.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40120-025-00751-9.

Body: Key Summary Points
      

Why carry out this study?
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease that causes muscle weakness, leading to significant social, professional, and emotional strain due to the unpredictable fluctuations of symptoms.The study investigated whether there are gaps in the communication needs of both patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) that could be limiting patient–HCP dialogue and shared decision-making (SDM) in the management of MG.To the best of our knowledge, existing needs assessments in MG include either the patients’ perspective or the HCPs’ perspective; this study uniquely incorporated both to define a learning intervention that aims to increase HCP empathy, enhance patient–HCP communication, and improve SDM practices.
What was learned from the study?
Though HCPs are knowledgeable about MG and its symptoms, there are differences in how patients and HCPs perceive the impact of these symptoms on patients’ daily lives; these differences lead to suboptimal patient–HCP communication, experiences and outcomes.Our findings revealed critical evidence and actionable insights that can directly inform and enhance HCP training, ensuring it promotes more effective communication and collaboration between HCPs and patients with MG. Integrating patient and HCP perspectives of how symptoms impact patients’ daily lives may serve as a model to enable more empathetic, personalized care.

    
    
      Introduction
      Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune neuromuscular disease characterized by damage at the neuromuscular junction and impaired synaptic transmission [1–3]. The condition causes patients to experience fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue, which impair the ability to carry out activities of daily living [4, 5]. The unpredictability of these fluctuations often makes it difficult for patients to plan daily activities and contributes to emotional, professional, and social strain. Patients can feel frustrated and isolated by their MG [6, 7], and this makes effective and empathetic patient–healthcare professional (HCP) dialogue essential for optimal disease diagnosis and management [7, 8].
      Research has demonstrated that, by actively listening and empathizing with their patients, HCPs are in a better position to acknowledge the nuanced ways in which MG affects their lives [7, 8] and to maintain adaptive dialogue [9]. Empathetic communication assists in creating an environment where patients feel encouraged to discuss the full spectrum and impact of their symptoms [7, 10]. Further, inadequate communication can have detrimental effects on early and accurate disease diagnosis. It can lead to misunderstandings that prevent patients from sharing their experiences or expressing concerns. This, in turn, can create long-term challenges in disease management for both patients and HCPs [11]. Effective communication is a key component of shared decision-making (SDM), aligning disease management choices with patients' values and ensuring that decisions are patient-centered and collaborative [12, 13]. Studies have consistently shown that patients who are actively involved in their own care tend to experience better health outcomes and greater satisfaction with their treatment [14–16].
      This publication reports Phase 1 of the three-phase ENGAGE educational pilot program. ENGAGE was conducted between July 2022 and December 2023 across Denmark, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (USA) and encompassed a needs assessment conducted with HCPs and patients with MG (Phase 1), a virtual reality (VR) educational intervention (Phase 2) and an outcome evaluation (Phase 3). The ENGAGE educational pilot program was designed to explore whether immersive learning using VR is an effective educational tool for neurologists to bridge the sense of disconnect between patients and HCPs. The program aimed to increase HCPs’ understanding of the patient experience, thereby improving patient–HCP dialogue and SDM in MG. The design of the VR learning intervention and the outcomes of the ENGAGE program (Phases 2 and 3) will be reported in a separate publication.
      This needs assessment aimed to elucidate the commonalities and disparities between patient and HCP perspectives on the impact of MG symptoms on patients’ daily lives and how effectively symptoms and their impact are communicated. By uniquely featuring both HCP and patient perspectives, this needs assessment sought to enhance the relevance of educational content and was a crucial step in designing the immersive educational intervention for HCPs involved in the management of patients with MG.
    
    
      Methods
      
        Study Design
        The three-phase ENGAGE program design is presented in Fig. 1. The purpose of the needs assessment (Phase 1) was two-fold: (1) to gather information on MG symptoms and their impact on patients’ daily lives from both patient and HCP perspectives, and (2) to provide benchmark data for the outcome evaluation. The study design was presented at the 9th Congress of the European Academy of Neurology 2023, and the 15th Annual European Continuing Medical Education Forum 2022, demonstrating the framework that guided the program’s development [17, 18].Fig. 1Study design of ENGAGE. HCP healthcare professional, MG myasthenia gravis, UK United Kingdom, USA United States of America, VR virtual reality
        The needs assessment followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of surveys and semi-structured interviews with both HCPs and patients. This pilot was led by a steering committee, which consisted of four patients, some of whom were representatives of patient organizations, and five MG specialist physicians. The survey was distributed via physician and patient members of the steering committee. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with HCPs and patients with MG, all of whom were selected with the help of the steering committee. Target recruitment numbers were 80 HCPs and 80 patients for completion of the survey, and 10 HCPs and 10 patients for participation in the interviews.
      
      
        Measurements
        The survey consisted of two parts; part one comprised six questions, starting with an open-ended question exploring the skills and knowledge necessary for SDM. Participants were presented with a list of 24 pre-defined domains covering essential SDM-related knowledge, skills, and attitudes, and were asked to select all options that they felt were essential to achieve effective SDM. Participants then rated readiness across each of these 24 domains on a 10-point Likert scale from 1 (no ability) to 10 (expert ability). Patients rated their HCP's readiness, while HCPs rated their own readiness (Supplementary Material). This component of the survey was used to inform the content of the immersive learning application and detect differences and commonalities between patients and HCPs. Part two of the survey consisted of questions drawn from the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF); items were selected from the original Huijg et al. (2014) 79-item questionnaire [19]. The items were tailored to the context of MG and patients’ experiences with patient–HCP dialogue and SDM in clinical settings. In total, 31 items representing 14 TDF domains were included. The TDF component of the survey was intended to serve as a baseline data point for the outcome evaluation survey that was distributed among HCPs after participation in the immersive learning experience.
        In addition to survey data, qualitative data on MG symptoms, challenges, and barriers to patient–HCP dialogue were collected through interviews with HCPs and patients with MG. The interviews were conducted using a discussion guide tailored to fit the needs of HCPs and patients within the context of MG. The questions in the discussion guide were established based on prior literature research on MG and its symptoms [7, 20], alongside a review of relevant articles published online (e.g., MG forums, blog and web posts with patient stories and patient stories featured on public social media accounts). Overall, with the help of the qualitative interviews, data were collected on: (1) the patient journey living/working with MG; (2) the most common and most troublesome symptoms of MG; (3) the most significant challenges of living with MG; (4) challenges in patient–HCP dialogue; and (5) best practices of engaging with patients and managing MG. The results of this needs assessment were then reviewed by the steering committee members. The insights gained upon completion of the data analysis formed the basis of designing the VR learning intervention (Phase 2), which will be published separately.
      
      
        Data Analysis
        Quantitative and qualitative data for the needs assessment were analyzed separately. Quantitative data from the survey were extracted to understand trends of knowledge, skills, and attitudes toward patient–HCP dialogue and SDM within the context of MG. Quantitative survey data were collected via Qualtrics (www.qualtrics.com), downloaded from the platform and then analyzed using SPSS Statistics 26.0. Data cleaning consisted of removing responses with more than 50% of the data missing. Categorical responses were represented as proportions, with ratings used to capture subjective assessments with greater nuance. The quantitative data results were used to illustrate common trends among HCPs and patients in terms of domains relevant to patient–HCP dialogue (e.g., knowing about the patient and their symptoms, the impact of these symptoms, the patient’s ideal treatment outcomes, and worries and concerns, as well as aspired qualities to foster adaptive dialogue).
        An artificial intelligence-assisted service (www.otter.ai) was used to transcribe the qualitative interviews. Interview data were then analyzed manually by the researchers using thematic analysis [21]. In our analysis, a hybrid coding approach was employed [22], beginning with a deductive framework that outlined key organizing themes based on theoretical expectations [23]. This approach allowed broad themes to be established, while also enabling an inductive process that helped refine subthemes as new insights emerged from the data [24, 25]. For instance, while many subthemes were identified a priori, others, like symptoms resulting in shame for some patients, surfaced as we iterated through the interview material. To simplify presentation of the most significant differences between HCPs and patients, quotes were subsequently reorganized around specific symptom types and key categories.
        HCP and patient interviews were initially coded manually by the researchers on a case-by-case basis illustrating occurring themes by extracting indicative quotes for reference. Once this step had been completed, interview data from HCPs and patients were condensed into one coding sheet allowing for a holistic picture of emerging themes and respective quotes. A count of occurrences by subtheme was also performed to allow depiction of the relevance of occurrences to create realistic content for the VR experience that resonated with both stakeholder groups alike.
      
      
        Ethical Consideration
        Institutional Review Board approval for the overall ENGAGE program, including this needs assessment, was granted by the University of Warwick, UK (Ethical Application Reference: HSSREC 41/22-23). The needs assessment was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Surveys were designed in accordance with both the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation. Informed consent was captured from the participants prior to their participation in the interview, and survey data were captured anonymously, password protected, and stored on a secure server. Interviews were conducted following consent from participants. Primary data were only available to essential members of the research team at LLH Concepts unless explicit consent was received from the respective participant. Participants consented to the publication of their insights.
      
    
    
      Results
      
        What Patients Don’t Say, and Physicians Don’t Ask
        In total, 55 HCPs and 133 patients with MG agreed to participate in the survey, of whom 47 HCPs and 122 patients provided responses. Respondents were from Denmark, Germany, the UK, and the USA. Among the HCPs who responded and completed the demographic section of the survey (N = 47), 59.6% (n = 28) were neurologists or neuromuscular specialists and 10.6% (n = 5) were nurses, including specialist nurses. Other HCP respondents included physiotherapists (2.1%; n = 1), alternative practitioners (10.6%; n = 5) and ‘Other’ (17.0%; n = 8). Responses from two HCPs had more than 50% of their data missing and were excluded from part one; 71 patients completed all required sections and were included.
        Analysis of the survey data from part one exploring HCP and patient perceptions of the impact of various MG symptoms on patients’ daily lives revealed that there were significant discrepancies as well as areas of strong alignment in the priorities each group placed on certain knowledge, skills, and attitudes in the management of MG (Fig. 2). The most notable discrepancies were that patients placed a much higher value on ability of the HCP to listen to them, have knowledge of their medical and treatment history, and engage them in discussions about their preferences and personal knowledge of the illness. On the other hand, HCPs prioritized knowing what matters to a person living with MG, providing support to the patient and their family/carer, offering suggestions for future and family planning, and asking what might interfere with treatment. The strong alignment on patience, sharing treatment information, understanding the impact of MG, and empathy showed that both parties agree on the necessity of a compassionate and informed approach to care.Fig. 2Survey data comparison (patient versus HCP)—importance of knowledge, skills, and attitudes. The reported categories individually represent types of knowledge, skills or attitudes. Categories are ordered from least aligned to most aligned between HCPs and patients; difference > 50% (red), difference ≥ 10%–50% (yellow), difference < 10% (green).

        The comparison of HCPs’ self-assessments with patient ratings revealed both disparities and alignment in their perceptions of knowledge, skills, and attitudes (Fig. 3). Differences were particularly apparent in areas where HCPs underestimated their performance, such as knowledge of the patient’s treatment history and appreciating the patient’s medical history. HCPs rated themselves highest in showing empathy and being a good listener, reflecting confidence in their interpersonal skills. Notably, HCPs and patients were closely aligned in areas such as appreciating how patients feel about their illness and treatment, having a good understanding of how the illness impacts a patient’s life, and sharing information on treatment options and outcomes.Fig. 3Survey data comparison (patient versus HCP)—rating of HCP readiness*.

        Key Symptoms and Challenges That Characterize Patient Experience in MG
        A total of 20 semi-structured interviews were carried out (10 HCPs and 10 patients with MG). The qualitative data from these interviews revealed significant complexities in patient–HCP interactions in MG. Key themes that emerged included the variability and multifaceted way in which symptoms impact patients’ lives, the challenges patients face in fully communicating their experiences, and the vital role of specialist HCPs, including specialist nurses, physiotherapists, and psychologists, in bridging these gaps, particularly in the areas of mental health and emotional support. There was strong alignment between HCPs and patients in recognizing the importance of understanding how MG affects patients' lives.
        
          MG Symptoms and Challenges—The HCP Perspective
          A full juxtaposition of HCP and patient perspectives on MG symptoms and challenges is presented in Table 1. HCPs noted specific symptoms that need to be addressed in a patient consultation, covering the most common symptoms of MG: ocular, bulbar, respiratory, and muscle fatigability, particularly in the limbs. HCPs stated that patients consistently mentioned fatigue as a prevalent and troublesome symptom of MG. As a result, HCPs highlighted the need to differentiate between fatigue and muscle fatigability. Many HCPs emphasized the risk of hospitalization as a particular concern when there is a risk of myasthenic crisis.Table 1Juxtaposition of MG symptoms and challenges from HCP and patient perspectivesAspectPerspectiveSupporting quoteOcular symptomsHCPHCPs highlight ptosis (drooping eyelid), diplopia (double vision) and other visual impairments as common concerns in patients with MG“Patients could present with double vision […], many of them simply have blurred vision. Patients describe this in such a variety of ways; some say that they must make an exaggerated effort to focus their vision on something, which is exhausting, or they feel a certain pressure on the eye.”PatientPatients often report on their symptoms in conjunction with how these symptoms add complications to their daily lives (e.g., how symptoms affect their appearance and confidence in social settings)“I didn't want to complain more about the suffering that seemed to relate only to my aesthetic. […] But at the same time […] it's a symptom that affects also my work because, of course, when I had to go to my shift I had to talk to people”"Then I also had double vision and then I couldn’t do the work any longer […] I saw the rows of teeth double.”Muscle fatigabilityHCPMuscle weakness, especially in the limbs and bulbar muscles, is a significant focus for HCPs, as it can impact mobility, independence and daily function“[…] the problem with fatigue is that it's also used in myasthenia to refer to a very specific sign in which weakness worsens with exercise, and it's often termed fatigable weakness. So, patients hear us talk, ‘you've experienced chronic fatigue’, [but] to try to understand that symptom is really difficult.”PatientPatients experience progressive muscle weakness in their limbs, arms and other areas, which restricts their ability to walk, move and complete daily tasks independently“[…] I could only walk with walking sticks. [Now] I am also dependent on a wheelchair, and I am practically unable to walk any longer. [I] was getting continuously worse […] so there is the weakness of the arms, difficulty speaking, my lung volume got really bad also.”“I love to cut my husband’s hair. And just that was becoming impossible.”Bulbar symptomsHCPHCPs are particularly concerned about dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and dysarthria (speech issues), as they significantly impair a patient's ability to eat and communicate“[…] within the first year or so, they can develop, slurring of speech and difficulty in swallowing. […] once they have passed that acute stage […] patients will mainly complain of the swallowing and speech problems as and when they develop relapses.”“I would say the more serious symptoms. […] the ones that I get most concerned about are swallowing troubles and breathing troubles, because that's what's going to land people in the hospital.”PatientPatients find swallowing and speech difficulties very frustrating, impacting their ability to engage in conversations and enjoy meals with others“[…] sometimes like, at nighttime, I can wake myself up because of stopped breathing and swallowing. Like I… I choke on my own saliva and stuff like even lying down at night. And that's quite horrible when that happens. And bending over can really affect my breathing, with my diaphragm not fully working.”FatigueHCPFatigue is one of the most challenging symptoms for HCPs to differentiate, as it can either be a result of muscle weakness or psychological factors, and it requires careful assessment“So, one of the first things patients usually flag is that they are exhausted/fatigued, they are always completely drained. This is something we describe as 'fatigue' and this is something we have to differentiate from exhaustion that stems from muscle weakness.”PatientPatients emphasize how fatigue affects their daily life and social activities, causing exhaustion after even minimal exertion, which reduces their quality of life"[…] So the one thing that’s a real handicap is that I need a lot of sleep and I get less out of my day […] I simply can’t do some things. Like for example some people my age go out in the evenings, but for me that’s either not possible anymore or I can start the next day only in the afternoon then.”Respiratory issuesHCPHCPs express major concern over respiratory issues, as they can lead to hospitalization or the need for mechanical respiration in severe cases“Even the controlled patients when they have stress, surgical or pregnancy, being in labor that sort of things they are at risk of being ventilated.”PatientPatients fear respiratory complications, noting the decline in lung function and the necessity of assistance with breathing“[I] was getting continuously worse […] so there is the weakness of the arms, difficulty speaking, my lung volume got really bad also now in hospital [sic], swallowing, I am often choking. I once had a really bad choking fit which weakened me even more.”Mental healthHCPHCPs acknowledge that depression and anxiety are prevalent comorbidities in patients with MG, adding an extra layer of complexity to care, but they often feel unequipped to manage these psychological aspects[Relating to one HCP’s patient]: “One of my patients […] his double vision lasted for a bit longer and he became suicidal, because he cycles about 150 miles a week and he held a very high, top managerial job, a young chap. And double vision was completely upsetting his life, because he couldn't cycle.”PatientPatients may not directly express concerns about depression or mental health challenges, however the emotional toll of MG becomes evident in how they describe the impact of the disease and its symptoms (e.g., limiting their ability to work, minimized opportunities for a fulfilling social life)“I was employed by a large international law firm […] and I was actually about to become the first female partner for that particular office. And then […] I realized I'm gonna have to resign, I can't keep going. […] that was devastating. And it also felt I've worked so hard to get to it, and it all came crashing down.”Age/gender-related challengesHCPHCPs highlight that younger patients often have a harder time accepting their diagnosis due to concerns about treatment side effects, such as weight gain from steroids or reproductive health issues related to immunosuppressants“Age and sex are clearly relevant. So, for example, a female patient should be considering reproductive history and also reproductive plans, that's going to turn out to be really important in that group. What medications do they… can they take? Are they able to take given the contraindications and so on?”PatientYounger patients often resist treatments due to fears of side effects (e.g., weight gain, acne), adding another challenge to coping with the disease itself. For younger women, the illness is often reported as affecting them in different ways, as it may interfere with their plans to have children, and symptoms can worsen during their menstrual cycles“[E]specially in the first day before my period and during the period I have a very bad worsening of symptoms, but just for the days.”“[F]or example they mentioned about me being a young woman and flagged that pregnancy might become a topic one day.”Daily living and independenceHCPHCPs aim to prevent MG crises but recognize that even with treatment, the disease can severely limit a patient's ability to live independently, affecting their ability to work and engage in daily activities[Relating to one HCP’s patient]:
“So due to [symptoms] they are also at higher risk of having a fall, they cannot drive anymore, but even as a pedestrian or cyclists they are not fully able any longer, they can't read anymore, they can't work and are constantly depending on help.”PatientPatients often report a loss of independence, with some needing to reduce work hours or rely on others for assistance, which they find difficult to accept“I moved back in with my parents, which is a very surreal situation to […] being that child again, if you like, no matter what you just revert to somehow your childhood self in some ways, when you live with your parents again, but I needed a lot of help.”Communication and trustHCPHCPs express concern over communication issues, as some patients omit critical information due to stress or mistrust, leading to incomplete symptom reporting and a more challenging diagnosis and treatment process“I think we as doctors have an idea of what information we want to get out of a patient for every visit. […] and I am very tempted to say 'Tell me this, tell me this, tell me this' […] But what I have learned to do is to just have people talk […] And then it's better for the relationship because patients feel heard rather than me just checking a list.”“If you ask them directly, they will also say 'Yes I have difficulty going down the stairs so I try to stay most of the time downstairs' […] So you need to ask 'Are you back to your normal life? Is this what you want? Are you happy with how things are?’ and often if there is a husband or a wife they will say 'No I think he doesn't really help out in the house and when he comes home from work, he is always tired.'”PatientSome patients feel dismissed or not heard by their physicians, leading to frustration and a sense that their individual needs are not being addressed“…because I was looking at my medical history. I had a lot of other symptoms. They were like screaming myasthenia gravis, and she, she knew about it, but she doesn't miss so I thought OK, maybe it's not? […]”“[…] [I]t didn’t seem to me he had any interest to look at a patient as an individual, I think he followed a bit of a cookie-cutter approach, and he was simply not willing to look at an individual patient and take time to understand what is this person’s specific situation.”"[…] a major issue was communication. I simply had the feeling that this physician didn’t understand what I was telling him about my condition. […] that was a situation where I thought I’m just not in good hands there.”Treatment and side effectsHCPHCPs are aware of the toll that side effects, such as weight gain and increased fatigue from treatments like steroids, have on patients, and they strive to guide patients through these challenges as best they can“[Patients] don't want to go on steroids, because they don't want to put on weight and they don't want to have acne […] and they don't want to go on immunosuppressive therapy because they are interested in their reproductive health […] so it's a real challenge for them to accept the disease and then to accept the side effects.”PatientPatients feel the need for clearer communication about how treatments will affect them, expressing concerns over side effects and the time it takes for medications to work effectively. Many patients feel overwhelmed by the uncertainty of how long it will take for treatments to show results, or whether they will be effective at all“I think I need to have the doctor take that time to tell me OK, what is actually going to happen? And tell me how I am supposed to take the medicine and which kind of side effects they see the most.”“The other thing that I tell people is with MG you need to be patient, because some of the treatments don't work overnight. However, you also need to be assertive, and if something isn't working, ask for another option.”Uncertainty and fluctuations in symptomsHCPHCPs find it difficult to track the progression of MG due to the unpredictable and fluctuating nature of the symptoms, making it challenging to monitor patients’ responses to treatment consistently"A lot of questions, a lot of uncertainty, especially when it concerns younger patients, because it affects so many areas of their lives, their social life, their working life, also communication with employers.”PatientPatients experience unpredictability in their symptoms, causing significant stress as they cannot plan their daily activities or anticipate how they will feel from one day to the next“So for about six, seven weeks, I would go every Friday to this ophthalmology clinic […]. And they would do these tests. And they would always show different results. So what they got was that it was fluctuating.”Coaching and emotional supportHCPSome HCPs acknowledge that they may lack the skills needed to provide adequate emotional support to patients, recognizing that treating MG requires more than just managing physical symptoms—it involves helping patients navigate complex emotions“The thing that I personally struggle with is probably the mental health element […] obviously I've had a bit of training, but I'm not a clinical psychologist.”PatientPatients frequently express the need for more emotional and psychological support from their healthcare providers, especially in terms of managing side effects and coming to terms with their diagnosis“What I would find useful is to be given a plan, for example to be told “OK listen, we will keep going with this until then and either it will starting working by then, but if not we will do this and that.” This would give you a bit of a perspective, because I find it really hard to being presented with this void of “Let’s wait and see” because I find that too unspecific.”"I think I need to have the doctor take that time to tell me OK, what is actually going to happen? And tell me how I am supposed to take the medicine […]? Which kind of side effects are the side effects that they see the most?”HCP healthcare professional, MG myasthenia gravis
          HCPs reported depression as a frequent comorbidity in patients with MG, reflecting the psychological impact of the disease. However, HCPs may lack expertise in dealing with such comorbidities, which may require collaboration with clinical psychologists, psychiatrists or HCPs in other specialties. Additionally, many HCPs reported challenges supporting patients diagnosed at a younger age. Due to the chronic nature of the disease, these patients need more help accepting their diagnosis and incorporating the disease into their daily routines than those diagnosed later in life.
          HCPs were aware that a comprehensive appreciation of the symptoms within the context of patients' daily lives is necessary, but they often lacked the time or skills to address these aspects. Accurately recording complete information about symptoms was sometimes difficult. While not explicitly queried, stress, shame, lack of trust and insufficient consultation time were mentioned in HCP interviews as factors that may explain why listening to patients and fully understanding their medical history can be challenging. Keeping abreast of a patient's MG journey also proved challenging. Inconsistencies in collecting data about patients' well-being and their response to treatment may lead to unnoticed declines in health, emphasizing the need for improved communication between patients and HCPs. Several HCPs mentioned that utilizing tools such as symptom monitoring devices or apps that send patients prompts to monitor and report their symptoms could help address this problem. In overcoming these multifaceted challenges, HCPs play a pivotal role in enhancing the overall care and well-being of patients.
        
        
          MG Symptoms and Challenges—The Patient Perspective
          In their interviews, patients reported a range of known MG symptoms, including dysphagia, dysarthria, ocular symptoms, and muscle weakness (Table 1). Patients who reported respiratory issues were concerned that these symptoms would reoccur or worsen in future. Fatigue and the need for increased rest were also prevalent among those interviewed. The most challenging aspect of the condition as communicated by patients was the impact of muscle weakness on their independent daily living, including participation in social and leisure activities. Additionally, patients reported concerns about the impact of MG on their work and ability to sustain financial independence. This included worries about decreased productivity, mobility issues impacting their commute and whether employers would be understanding of their illness. Many found themselves forced to reduce working hours or cease working altogether.
          The struggle to maintain a normal life post-diagnosis is a common experience among patients. Notably, symptoms such as ptosis and facial drooping have an aesthetic impact, raising concerns about others' perceptions. While comorbidities were not directly discussed, some patients alluded to the broader implications of living with a chronic illness, including its effects on mental health and overall well-being, emphasizing the strain it puts on planning and engaging in various activities. Furthermore, side effects from medication complicated the pursuit of hobbies.
          Establishing effective communication with HCPs emerged as another prominent hurdle. Some patients recounted experiences of unhelpful interactions; for example, sometimes HCPs appeared disinterested in listening to symptoms and other times challenged or misinterpreted reported symptoms. Some patients failed to mention issues like ptosis, assuming it was 'only' cosmetic or expecting the HCP would ask if it mattered. Additionally, some patients, like one who felt sad about no longer being able to run marathons, hesitated to share their true feelings, believing they should be content with the treatment's results. This led to missed opportunities for adjustments to disease management, as HCPs assumed the patients were satisfied and did not inquire further—only discovering these needs by chance. Although both groups mentioned HCP–patient communication as an important aspect of patient care, different points were made. Patients shared mixed reports on experiences with their HCPs, with some HCPs being a very positive force in their care and others leaving the patients feeling unheard. HCPs noted the challenges that can arise in HCP–patient communication and the fact that trust, the ability of patients to communicate their symptoms and needs, and HCPs’ skills to ask the right questions are all important for SDM.
          Enhancing the HCP's empathy and appreciation of MG was seen as a potential remedy to improve accurate reporting of symptoms by patients. The prolonged and sometimes life-threatening symptoms endured before receiving an MG diagnosis contribute to the patients' struggles. While acknowledging the rarity of MG, patients expressed concerns about the delayed referral to specialty HCPs. The lengthy diagnostic process underscores the need for expedited access to specialized care. A significant source of concern arose from the potential side effects of medications used to manage MG. Patients often grapple with the dual burden of coping with the physical symptoms of the disease, while simultaneously navigating the adverse effects of their prescribed medications.
          An additional consideration in disease management is patients’ apprehension about side effects, including weight gain from steroid use. Patients emphasized the need for better assistance in planning treatment, including information on how long it might take for medication to take effect, while at the same time receiving reassurance on how to best navigate side effects.
        
        
          Differences in how Patients and HCPs Report on Symptoms and Challenges
          Patients and HCPs were generally aligned on the symptoms prevalent in MG. However, patients focused more on the impact these symptoms have on their daily lives, including their ability to work, maintain independence, and participate in social activities, than did HCPs (Table 1). Additionally, patients expressed concerns about the aesthetic aspects (e.g., concerns about what others may think). In contrast, HCPs prioritized symptom monitoring based on clinical parameters to manage the risk of hospitalization and to prevent patients from deteriorating to a myasthenic crisis. This difference in focus explains the varying priorities of patients and HCPs when it comes to managing symptoms and challenges. Key challenges for HCPs included distinguishing between muscle fatigability and fatigue, addressing comorbidities such as depression, and the uncertainty surrounding symptom fluctuations.
          While patients were keen on finding the best treatment to improve their condition, they were also concerned about medication side effects such as weight gain and increased fatigue. Additionally, patients struggled with the uncertainty of how long it will take for medications to work and whether they will be effective at all. HCPs were aware of patients' worries about side effects and often found themselves needing to coach and support patients through their treatment journey, with some HCPs feeling inadequately skilled to provide this level of support. Due to the uncertainty of MG, its chronic nature, and the resulting impact on quality of life and well-being, younger people in particular require careful monitoring. Effective communication with HCPs and trust issues remain key challenges for patients.
        
      
    
    
      Discussion
      Rare autoimmune diseases like MG require lifelong management [1], with collaboration between patients and HCPs needed to minimize the disease's impact on patients' lives. Our approach, which aimed to provide a greater understanding of HCP and patient communication needs in the management of MG, was novel, integrating both HCP and patient perspectives and critically comparing their views to obtain a more accurate understanding of MG symptoms’ impact on patients' lives. This research indicated that patients and HCPs are generally aligned on the most challenging symptoms of MG; however, assessments of these symptoms and their severity can vary significantly. HCPs often focus on clinical indicators, rather than patients' personal experiences and the subtle ways in which these symptoms affect patients’ daily lives.
      Patients prioritize maintaining an independent and fulfilling life, striving to continue their professional activities and hobbies despite their disease. Symptoms that patients feel may seem minor to some HCPs can significantly impact a patient’s quality of life (e.g., ptosis). Hence, HCPs should take extra time to thoroughly explore the full impact of symptoms on patients, creating a safe environment for patients to express themselves openly and honestly. Our data suggest that, while HCPs feel confident in their interpersonal skills, there is a gap in how they perceive their knowledge and information-sharing abilities compared with patients’ impressions. The expectation that patients will communicate what matters to them may result in important questions not being asked by HCPs. The nature of questions asked can have a strong influence on the HCP’s perception of the disease impact and thus how it is managed [7]. Equally, HCPs seemed to overestimate their listening skills compared with patients’ perceptions, suggesting that a greater awareness of the importance of listening to patients is required; patients may avoid voicing issues if they feel that the HCP is not interested. HCPs noted the challenges that can arise in patient–HCP communication and highlighted trust, the ability of patients to communicate their symptoms and needs, and the skill of the HCP to ask the right questions as important for SDM and patient care. This research reinforces that there is an ongoing need for patient and HCP education to improve communication about how patients’ symptoms impact their daily lives and goals, and the perception of what classes as successful SDM. Patients shared reports on the quality of their care, and HCPs confirmed that an unmet need remains for patients living with MG. This research also illustrates that there is a need for consensus among HCPs on the overall care of patients with MG to comprehensively improve outcomes for all patients and to elevate the standard of care in MG.
      This needs assessment adopted a patient-centric approach, by engaging both patients and HCPs, building on insights from previous phenomenological studies [7, 26, 27]. HCPs provided their responses from a broad perspective based on the MG population and subpopulations that they care for, and patients reported on their individual and personal perspectives. By integrating the voice of patients as well as of HCPs, who were the target learners in the ENGAGE pilot program, this needs assessment went beyond traditional educational design practice, which typically assesses only the learner’s perspective. This deep understanding of patient and HCP needs in MG allowed the VR experience to be designed in a way that truly reflected the experiences of patients and addressed the educational needs of HCPs, including those identified by patients.
      Limitations of this needs assessment have been identified. Participating patients and HCPs were identified by the steering committee. To recruit patients, the committee distributed invitations to members of their respective patient organizations. HCPs from participating hospitals who were involved in the ENGAGE educational program were invited to participate. While this ensured a level of expertise and engagement, it may have introduced selection and inclusion bias. When considering the implications of this needs assessment, it is important to reflect on the participant numbers. Although significant efforts were made to maximize response rates, target HCP response rates (80 HCPs) were not met. To avoid potential bias and low response rates, future studies could employ broader recruitment strategies, such as random sampling or open calls for participation. Further, although the study was conducted in four countries, it was only conducted in English, which may impact its generalizability.
      
        Outlook and Future Research
        This study highlighted a significant disconnect between patients with MG and HCPs regarding the disease's impact on patients’ daily lives, communication challenges, and the effectiveness of SDM. Actively involving patients in the development of educational interventions bridges this gap, fostering better understanding and alignment between patient needs and HCP perspectives. For instance, the operationalization of Patient Advisory Councils, as described by Nielssen et al. [28], demonstrates how structured patient engagement can improve healthcare delivery by aligning interventions with patient priorities, while offering practical lessons for sustaining such initiatives. Additionally, Ferra et al. [29] emphasized the success of participatory advisory boards in mental health research, highlighting their value in shaping research agendas and ensuring patient-centered outcomes.
        Other approaches to enhance patient–HCP communication, such as innovative telemedicine services, could supplement subjective perceptions with measurable, objective parameters, thereby providing HCPs with a more comprehensive overview of patients’ symptoms and response to treatment [30].
      
    
    
      Conclusions
      To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first HCP and patient co-led, co-authored needs assessment that examines the alignment between HCP and patient perspectives on the impact of key symptoms of MG on patients’ daily lives, patient–HCP communication challenges, and SDM in MG. This study revealed that informed and compassionate care is essential in managing MG and directly impacts patient outcomes. For example, understanding how symptoms affect patients’ daily lives builds trust and improves treatment adherence. Without this, patients may feel misunderstood, compromising their well-being and the effectiveness of care. We hope that it will enhance the recognition and appreciation of the impact of MG and inspire future approaches to HCP educational interventions, SDM, and patient outcomes.

Title: Application of Microwave Ablation Combined With Chai Hu Qing Gan Tang in the Treatment of Idiopathic Granulomatous Mastitis

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the efficacy of microwave ablation (MVA) combined with Chai Hu Qing Gan Tang (CHQGT) for idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM).
Methods: 480 patients were divided into the CHQGT combination group (CHQGT + MVA), corticosteroid combination group (glucocorticoids + MVA) and control group (glucocorticoids), with 160 cases in each group. Data on patient information, treatment effects, adverse effects and breast appearance were collected. Network pharmacology was used to identify the effective active ingredients and target information of CHQGT. The Gene Cards database was used to obtain the relevant targets of IGM, and the drug-component–common target relationship network was constructed using Cytoscape 3.9.1 software.
Results: All treatment groups showed significant differences in Visual Analog Scale score, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, mass size and the total effective rate (p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in the rate of excellent breast shape between the three groups after treatment (p < 0.001), with the rate higher in the CHQGT liver decoction combined with glucocorticoids treatment group compared with the control group. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions and recurrence rate between the three groups within 2 years after treatment (p < 0.001), with the incidence of adverse reactions and recurrence rate higher in the control group than in the glucocorticoid combination and CHQGT decoction combination groups. Network pharmacology identified 199 active ingredients and 23 drug-disease targets of CHQGT. The molecular docking results showed that the main active components screened had good binding activity with their corresponding target proteins.
Conclusion: The combination of CHQGT and MWA is comparable in overall therapeutic efficacy to the combination of glucocorticoids and MWA. However, the CHQGT and MWA combination is superior in reducing lump size, alleviating patient pain and accelerating recovery.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM), also known as granulomatous lobular mastitis, is a rare benign inflammatory disease of the breast, first described by Kessler and Wolloch in 1972 [1, 2]. The histological characteristic of IGM is noncaseating granulomatous inflammation, centered on the breast lobules, with or without microabscesses [3]. The disease typically presents as a unilateral, firm tender mass with sizes ranging from 0.5 to 10 cm, with overlying skin inflammation, while sometimes it may also manifest as a nontender mass or pain alone [4]. Nipple retraction, sinus formation and axillary lymph node enlargement can also be observed [5, 6]. The most common symptoms of IGM reported in the literature are breast mass (48%–100%), fistula or abscess (16%–52%) and inflammation or erythema (11%) [7–12]. The condition usually occurs during the reproductive years, between the ages of 20 and 40, typically within 2 months–15 years after childbirth [13, 14]. The disease is both self-limiting and recurrent [15, 16], with prolonged inflammatory damage and repeated episodes in severe cases resulting in scarring and breast deformation [17], negatively impacting the health and quality of life of women.
      While IGM is a rare benign breast disease, its incidence has been rising in recent years, potentially due to increased pathological diagnosis. Studies indicate that IGM accounts for 24% of all inflammatory breast diseases. The annual prevalence rate and incidence rate of IGM are 2.4 per 100,000 women and 0.37%, respectively. Its recurrence rate ranges between 5% and 50%, with a history of pregnancy, breastfeeding, breast infections and smoking established as risk factors for IGM recurrence [18]. Among Han Chinese women with benign breast diseases, IGM constitutes 3.5% [19].
      Currently, the exact aetiology and mechanisms underlying IGM remain unclear, and its treatment is controversial. The preferred treatment method for IGM has not yet been standardised. Current treatment options include close monitoring, antibiotic therapy, surgical excision (limited or extensive) and immunosuppressive drugs such as glucocorticoids, methotrexate and azathioprine [20, 21]. Although surgical excision is a common treatment for IGM, studies have shown that it carries a high risk of poor wound healing, fistula or abscess formation and recurrence, with recurrence rates and the incidence of abscesses or fistulas varying from 5% to 50% and 4.7%–30%, respectively [4, 5, 9, 13, 20]. The disease is typically classified as nonlactational mastitis. In addition to surgery, conservative treatments may also involve the use of glucocorticoids and/or triple therapy for tuberculosis, which includes methotrexate and other immunosuppressive drugs. However, due to significant side effects that may occur during treatment, extended treatment durations, recurrent abscesses and persistent wound infections, patients often struggle to complete the entire treatment regimen, potentially leading to the need for surgical intervention [22, 23]. Therefore, developing more effective treatment strategies is crucial for improving the therapeutic outcomes and quality of life for patients with IGM.
      In traditional Chinese medicine, this disease is classified under the category of ‘comedomastitis.' It is believed that its onset is often due to nipple deformities or emotional disturbances leading to liver qi stagnation, resulting in blocked meridians and disrupted qi and blood flow. This stagnation transforms into phlegm; stagnant qi and blood can turn hot, causing the flesh to rot and form pus, which after breaking down results in a fistula. If the stagnated qi transforms into fire, it can cause nipple bleeding [24]. Treatment methods include multiple incisions for drainage, curettage, ointment bandaging and the external application of medicinal gauze infused with herbs that promote granulation and remove necrotic tissue. Internal medications aim to invigorate qi, nourish blood, drain pus, detoxify, soften hardness and disperse nodules [25]. This comprehensive treatment yields satisfactory results, benefiting the preservation of the breast's appearance and offering long-term advantages concerning recurrence rates. In ‘Surgery of Traditional Chinese Medicine' [24], for the liver meridian heat type of comedomastitis, the chosen prescription is Chai Hu Qing Gan Tang (CHQGT) (Bupleurum liver-clearing decoction), the main ingredients of which include Bupleurum (Chai Hu), red peony, selfheal and Hedyotis diffusa. This formula can clear heat, cool blood, soothe the liver, regulate qi, reduce swelling and disperse nodules [26]. It significantly alleviates the clinical symptoms of granulomatous mastitis, aids recovery, has minimal toxic side effects, a low recurrence rate and certain safety.
      Microwave ablation (MWA) under ultrasound guidance is a significant minimally invasive intervention, applied to various benign and malignant tumours. With precise ultrasound guidance, the IGM lesion is punctured, followed by MWA. By adjusting microwave emissions, denatured proteins from the diseased cells are used to remove the affected tissue. The procedure duration for MWA is shorter and can treat larger lesions, alleviating patients' pain. Ultrasound guidance achieves accurate positioning, preventing the missed diagnosis of affected tissues. Moreover, the high temperature leads to the loss of immunogenicity in the affected tissues, eliminating IGM at its root and reducing its recurrence.
      Therefore, combining CHQGT with MWA integrates the advantages of both, further enhancing therapeutic effects and shortening the disease course. However, currently, there is limited research on the combined treatment of IGM using CHQGT and MWA. This study focuses on patients with IGM in exploring the clinical effects of this combined treatment approach in their therapeutic process. The possible pharmacological mechanism is analysed by means of network pharmacology.
    
    
      2. Research Participants and Methods
      
        2.1. Clinical Research Section
        
          2.1.1. Research Participants
          Using convenience sampling based on age, we retrospectively analysed 480 cases of patients with IGM treated in the Breast Surgery Department of our hospital between January 2020 and December 2021. All patients were diagnosed with IGM by core needle biopsy prior to hospitalisation. The random number table method was used to group the patients according to the treatment method. The operation steps were as follows: (1) the patients were numbered by drawing lots; (2) starting from any number in the random number table, a random number was obtained for each experimental unit in the same direction; and (3) for grouping, the random numbers were arranged from small to large (if the numbers were the same, the first number was placed in front). The patients corresponding to the first 160 random numbers were included in the CHQGT combination group (CHQGT + MWA), the patients corresponding to the middle 160 random numbers were included in the glucocorticoid combined group (glucocorticoids + MVA) and the last 160 patients were included in the control group (glucocorticoids).
          IGM was diagnosed by combining the patient's clinical manifestations, physical examination, breast ultrasonography and histopathological findings (Figure 1). Most of the clinical manifestations of these patients were painful masses on one side of the breast, and there was no obvious abnormality in local skin colour and temperature at the beginning of the disease. As the disease progresses, more than 50% of patients have inflammatory changes in the affected side of the breast, such as erythema and swelling. Other symptoms include sunken nipples, fistulas and ulcers, and around 37% of patients develop abscesses. Lesions can occur in any quadrant of the breast, mostly from the peripheral quadrant, gradually spreading to the areola area and even to the entire breast in a short time. Some patients may be accompanied by fever, chills, rash and other systemic symptoms [27]. The typical ultrasonographic manifestations of IGM are multiple adjacent hypoechoic masses with posterior acoustic shadow or posterior acoustic shadow enhancement. Advanced cases show effusion, cavity or even strip hypoechoic (sinus); rich blood flow signals or signs of angiogenesis can be seen in the diseased area, and 15%–55% of cases can exhibit ipsilateral axillary reactive lymph node enlargement [28]. The final diagnosis of IGM depends on histopathology, and hollow needle biopsy is the first choice of method. The disease's typical pathological feature is the formation of a noncaseous necrotic granuloma with breast lobule as the centre, accompanied by local infiltration of multinucleated giant cells, epithelioid cells, lymphocytes and plasma cells [29]. In traditional Chinese medicine, IGM belongs to the category of ‘acne mastitis' (female nipple belongs to ‘liver' and breast belongs to ‘stomach'), which is characterised by loss of liver qi and stagnation of qi. Stagnation of liver qi leads to obstruction of milk collaterals, stagnation of liver and stomach, phlegm and blood stasis, obstruction of breast collaterals, agglomeration, heat for long periods and meat rot resulting in abscess and fistula following ulceration [30].
          This study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital (Ethics No. 202044). All participants were informed and signed written consent forms. The inclusion criteria were as follows: patients with (1) signs of liver-qi depression, such as breast pain, dysmenorrhea chest tightness, ventosity, constipation and depression; (2) onset within 1 month, without undergoing hormone, antituberculosis drug, immunotherapy or surgical treatment (excluding simple abscess drainage surgery), and those requiring conservative drug treatment during the acute progression period; and (3) women aged between 18 and 60 years old (inclusive of both 18 and 60).
          The exclusion criteria included (1) coexistence of malignant breast tumours, other endocrine diseases, autoimmune diseases or inflammatory diseases with symptoms similar or identical to those of IGM; (2) coexistence of other breast diseases, or patients taking medication that might influence the study results; (3) coexistence of severe cardiovascular diseases, primary diseases such as liver or kidney dysfunction, or mental disorders; (4) pregnant or lactating women; and (5) individuals with a predisposition to allergies or known allergies to the class of drugs or its components.
          The elimination criteria were as follows: (1) pregnancy during treatment; (2) poor compliance, failing to attend follow-up visits or provide relevant case report information; and (3) discovery of other violations of the inclusion criteria or meeting the exclusion criteria during the study.
          The termination criteria included (1) serious adverse reactions during the trial (mainly adverse reactions to the use of glucocorticoids, including osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, aggravated infection, induced or aggravated gastric and duodenal ulcers); (2) unexpected circumstances arose, making it challenging to evaluate the drug's efficacy; and (3) treatment was forcibly terminated due to other diseases (mainly secondary diabetes and other diseases that could not be addressed in this study).
        
        
          2.1.2. Research Methods
          For the control group, prednisone was used for treatment, starting at a dose of 20 mg/d. Upon symptom relief, the dosage was gradually reduced every 1-2 weeks sequentially to 16, 12, 8, and 4 mg/d, and was maintained at 4 mg/d until the end of the treatment course. The judgment was made by clinicians based on expert consensus. The criteria for determining symptom relief are the disappearance of clinical symptoms, the inaccessibility of the original inflammatory lesions clinically and the healing of ulcers or sores, but the presence of scattered minor lesions is still visible on imaging [31]. The total duration of treatment was 3 months. Patients unresponsive to the treatment underwent surgical excision. The criteria for determining such patients are as follows: (1) clinical symptoms (breast lump size, redness, swelling and pain) are not relieved after 1 week of treatment; (2) imaging shows no response to treatment (stable or enlarged lesion range); and (3) the granulomatous lobular mastitis disease activity index remains unchanged or increases [31].
          For the glucocorticoids combined group, MWA treatment was added to the regimen of the control group. The MWA device (KY-2000, Nanjing Canyon Medical Technology Co., Nanjing, China) operated at a frequency of 2450 MHz. The MWA needle had an outer diameter of 16G and a transmission tip length of 3 mm. Ultrasound examinations were performed using the American GE Logiq P9 ultrasound device (probe: 9–12 LMHz) and operated on an ultrasound imaging software platform equipped with an Italian Demetro 16G semiautomatic biopsy needle. Ultrasound was used to determine the lesion's location, size, number, blood flow signals and echo characteristics. Local infiltration anaesthesia was administered to the patient's breast skin and retromammary space prior to treatment. Physiological saline was injected into lesion areas close to the skin, areola and muscles to form a barrier to prevent thermal injury. Individualised ablation treatment plans were formulated based on ultrasound results of the lesion. The treatment plan included determining the needle insertion point, needle insertion depth, number of needle insertions, lesion fluid aspiration and duration of ablation. The microwave power was set to 25–30 W. Under ultrasound guidance, the active tip of the MWA needle was placed within the lesion, and the entire process was continuously observed under dynamic ultrasound in multiple sections. Dilated milk ducts were gradually ablated from deep to shallow along the duct wall. Micro-abscesses were treated with pinpoint ablation, and multipoint, multilevel mobile ablation was used for multiple lesions and larger lesions (maximum diameter: > 2 cm). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was employed to determine whether the ablation was complete (intraoperative ultrasound monitoring with SonoVue infusion into the cubital vein [2.4 mL]). Ablation was considered complete when no contrast agent perfusion was observed in the ablation area. If the ablation was incomplete, the ablation process had to be repeated immediately. Following ablation, patients were treated with local dressings and ice packs and were discharged 4–6 h later. Patients unresponsive to the treatment underwent surgical excision.
          For the CHQGT combination group, treatment was administered using CHQGT combined with MWA, with the MWA procedure being the same as described above. The prescription for CHQGT is as follows: 9 g of Bai Gui (Paeonia lactiflora), 9 g of Dang Gui (Angelica sinensis), 15 g of Bai Jian (ampelopsis japonica), 10 g of rhizome, 10 g of turmeric, 6 g of dried citrus peel, 5 g of licorice, 18 g of dandelion and 18 g of Shi Zi (Ardisia chinensis Benth). Following preparation, the patient took the decoction orally once a day, and continued this for a month, until the lesion completely disappeared or the treatment was ineffective. Patients unresponsive to the treatment underwent surgical excision.
        
        
          2.1.3. Data Collection
          We aimed to compare the overall treatment effect of the three groups, including the effect on reducing lump size, reducing patient pain and accelerating recovery. Data regarding the patient's age, body mass index (BMI), number of lesions, size of lesions, distribution of lesions, marital and childbirth history, white blood cell count (WBC), percentage of neutrophils (NEUT%), C-reactive protein (CRP), efficacy at the end of the study and breast appearance following treatment were collected. After treatment, data from 1, 3 and 5 months were collected, including Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) scores, and lump size. After the end of treatment, the patients were followed up for 2 years, and the patients were requested to undergo a follow-up every 3 months to investigate any recurrence and adverse reactions.
          In terms of efficacy, with reference to the Standards of Diagnosis and Therapeutic Effect of TCM Diseases and Syndromes from 1994 in the People's Republic of China, the outcomes were classified into the following: (1) cured: breast redness, swelling, heat and pain had disappeared, the fistula healed, no pseudo-healing and all systemic symptoms had disappeared; (2) improved: most of the lump had disappeared or most of the fistula had healed, with superficial wounds remaining unhealed; and (3) ineffective: the breast still exhibited redness, swelling, heat and pain, the fistula did not heal, or the lesion area had even expanded. The efficacy rate = (cured + improved)/N × 100% [32].
          Based on the standards jointly established by the American Surgical Association, Radiological Society, Pathological Society and the Surgical Oncology Society, breast appearance was categorised as follows: (1) excellent: the size and shape of the breast after treatment are roughly the same as the contralateral breast; (2) good: retraction and skin changes of the breast involve less than 1/4 of the original; (3) fair: retraction and skin changes involve between 1/4 and 1/2 of the breast; (4) poor: breast deformity involves more than 1/2 of the breast. The good-to-excellent rate = (excellent + good)/total cases × 100% [33].
          The VAS score was used to evaluate the pain situation before and after treatment in the three groups, with the score directly proportional to the level of pain. A score of 0 indicates no pain, with a maximum of 10. Scores of < 3 indicate mild pain, 4–6 represents moderate pain and > 7 indicates severe pain [34].
          The HAMD was developed by Hamilton in 1960. The scale has 24 items across seven categories: anxiety/somatisation, weight, cognitive impairment, diurnal variation, retardation, sleep disturbances and feelings of despair. In terms of scoring criteria, a total score of > 35 indicates severe depression, 21–35 signifies mild-to-moderate depression, 8–20 represents borderline depression and < 8 means no depression [35].
          The HAMA is used to evaluate patients anxiety symptoms before and after nursing. A score of < 7 indicates no anxiety symptoms and is psychologically normal; scores of > 7 but < 14 suggest possible anxiety symptoms; scores of > 14 but < 21 indicate definite anxiety symptoms; scores of > 21 but < 29 confirm significant anxiety symptoms; and scores of > 29 represent severe anxiety symptoms. The score is inversely proportional to the severity of anxiety symptoms; the lower the score is, the milder the symptoms [36].
        
        
          2.1.4. Statistical Analysis
          Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 26.0 software. Data conforming to a normal distribution were expressed in terms of means and standard deviation (x ± s). Intergroup comparisons were performed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), with pairwise comparisons utilising the least significant difference method. Count data were expressed as frequency and percentage, with the chi-square (χ2) test or Fisher's exact test used for intergroup comparisons and the chi-square partition method for pairwise comparisons. A significance level of p < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.

          2.2.1. Screening of Active Ingredients and Related Targets of Bupleurum Qinggan Decoction
          In the traditional Chinese medicine systems pharmacology database and analysis platform (TCMSP) (https://tcmspw.com/tcmsp.php/), the effective active ingredients of the formula were screened using 12 traditional Chinese medicines of Bupleurum Qinggan Tang as keywords, with oral bioavailability ≥ 30% and drug likeness ≥ 0.18 used as the limiting conditions. The target protein was converted into a standard name using the UniProt database (https://sparql.uniprot.org/).
        
        
          2.2.2. Acquisition of IGM-Related Targets and Key Targets
          The keyword ‘idiopathic granulomatous mastitis' was searched in the Gene Cards (https://www.genecards.org/) database to obtain disease-related targets. The drug active ingredient targets and disease targets were introduced into Venny 2.1.0 to create a Wayne diagram, and the drug/disease key targets of the CHQGT decoction for the treatment of IGM were obtained.
        
        
          2.2.3. Construction of Chai Hu Qinggan Decoction for the Treatment of IGM Target Network
          The data on the drugs, active ingredients, disease-related targets and their attribute files were imported into Cytoscape 3.9.1, and the composition–disease–target network diagram of Bupleurum Qinggan decoction and IGM was plotted.
        
        
          2.2.4. Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) Network Construction of Intersecting Targets
          The drug–disease intersection target was input into the STRING database (https://www.string-db.org). The species was selected as ‘Homo sapiens,' the minimum interaction threshold was set to ‘medium confidence (0.4)' and the PPI network was obtained. The results were imported into Cytoscape 3.9.1 for visualisation.
        
        
          2.2.5. Gene Oncology (GO) Enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway Enrichment Analysis
          The intersection targets of the CHQGT decoction in the treatment of IGM were imported into the DAVID database (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/), and p < 0.05 was set. GO enrichment analysis was performed in terms of three modules: biological process (BP), cellular component (CC) and molecular function (MF). The entries of the enrichment results were plotted as bar charts and bubble charts using an online data analysis visualisation platform (https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/).
        
        
          2.2.6. Molecular Docking Verification of Key Targets
          The top 5 core active ingredients were calculated according to the topological parameter Degree value, and the three-dimensional (3D) structure in Mol2 format was downloaded from the TCMSP database and the structure was imported into ChemBio3DUltra 14.0 for energy minimisation. The 3D structure of the core protein gene was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank database, and Pymol2.3.0 was used to remove protein crystal water and original ligands. AutoDock was used (v1.5.6) to hydrogenate the core active ingredients and key targets, calculate the charge, etc. and save them in PDBQT format. Then, POCASA 1.1 was used to predict the protein binding site and AutoDock Vina1.1.2 was used for docking. The PyMOL 2.3.0 and LigPlot V2.2.5 systems were used to analyse the interaction mode of the docking results. The binding activity of the compound and the core protein target was evaluated according to the binding energy, with the binding energy of < −5.0 kJ/mol selected as the screening condition to evaluate the docking effect of the two.

        3.1. Clinical Research Part
        
          3.1.1. General Information
          The results indicated that before treatment, there were no statistically significant differences among the three groups of patients in terms of age, BMI, smoking history, alcohol consumption history, number of lesions, size of lesions, distribution of lesions, marital and fertility history, WBC, NEUT% and CRP (all p > 0.05). This suggested that the three groups of patients were comparable, as shown in Table 1.
        
        
          3.1.2. Changes in Patients' Lump Size and Psychological Status After Treatment
          Colour Doppler ultrasound was used to monitor changes in lesion volume during treatment (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Single-factor repeated-measures ANOVA was employed to investigate the effects of different treatment methods on VAS scores, HAMD scores, HAMA scores and lump sizes for the three patient groups. According to the Shapiro–Wilk test, the data of each group followed an approximate normal distribution (p > 0.05). According to Mauchly's test of sphericity, the variance–covariance matrices of the groups were equal (p > 0.05). Data were presented as x ± s, as shown in Table 2. The results are summarised as follows. The interaction of time ∗ treatment was significant in VAS scores, HAMD scores, HAMA scores and lump sizes across the three groups (FVAS score = 322.111, p < 0.001; FHAMDscore = 219.432, p < 0.001; FHAMAscore = 112.122, p < 0.001; Flump⁣size = 144.561, p < 0.001), indicating that the individual effect changes in VAS scores, HAMD scores, HAMA scores and lump sizes were different among the three groups. Moreover, with the extension of time, the scores and lump sizes in all three groups generally decreased (FVAS score = 123.456, p < 0.001; FHAMD score = 245.423, p < 0.001; FHAMA score = 247.218, p < 0.001; Flump⁣size = 145.131, p < 0.001), indicating a significant change in the patients' VAS scores, HAMD scores, HAMA scores and lump sizes over time. Lastly, the influence of different treatment methods on VAS scores, HAMD scores, HAMA scores and lump sizes varied across the three patient groups (FVAS score = 145.423, p < 0.001; FHAMD score = 144.393, p < 0.001; FHAMA score = 145.642, p < 0.001; Flump⁣size = 287.328, p < 0.001).
          Further pairwise comparisons were made in terms of VAS scores, HAMD scores, HAMA scores and lump sizes across the three patient groups at different time points. There were no statistically significant differences among the three groups in any of the metrics (all p > 0.05), suggesting good comparability across the groups. The descriptions of the metrics for the three groups at 1, 3, and 5 months are as follows. For VAS scores, at 1 and 3 months, the ranking was CHQGT combination group < corticosteroid combination group < control group; at 5 months, CHQGT combination group = corticosteroid combination group < control group. For HAMD and HAMA scores, the ranking at 1, 3, and 5 months were the same, with CHQGT combination group = corticosteroid combination group < control group. For lump size, at the first month, the ranking was CHQGT combination group = corticosteroid combination group < control group; at 3 and 5 months, it was CHQGT combination group < corticosteroid combination group < control group (Table 2).
        
        
          3.1.3. Comparison of Treatment Efficacy Among the Three Groups
          The overall effective rates were 91.88%, 87.50% and 67.50% in the CHQGT combination group, glucocorticoids combination group and control group, respectively. The comparison results of treatment efficacy showed a statistically significant difference in the overall effective rate among the three groups (χ2 = 55.824, p < 0.001). Pairwise comparison revealed that the CHQGT combination group and glucocorticoids combination group had a better curative effect than the control group. However, there were no significant difference between the CHQGT combination group and the glucocorticoids combination group. In addition, the disease duration of the CHQGT, glucocorticoids and control groups were compared, with the durations 5.54 ± 3.03, 5.85 ± 3.04, 8.24 ± 3.21 months, respectively. There was a significant difference in the disease duration among the three groups (F = 11.360, p < 0.001). Following pairwise comparison, the difference of disease duration among the groups was statistically significant (Table 3).
        
        
          3.1.4. Comparison of Adverse Reactions During Treatment
          Within 2 years after treatment, 4 patients in the CHQGT combination group, 15 patients in the corticosteroid combination group and 34 patients in the control group experienced adverse reactions, with overall adverse reactions incidence rates of 2.50%, 9.38% and 21.25%, respectively, showing a statistical difference among the three groups (p < 0.001). The comparison of adverse reactions showed that the incidence rate of adverse reactions during treatment in the CHQGT combination group and glucocorticoids combination group was significantly lower than that in the control group (Table 4).
        
        
          3.1.5. Comparison of Recurrence
          The results showed that within 2 years after treatment, 30 patients in the combination group, 35 in the glucocorticoids group and 50 in the control group were readmitted to the hospital for relapse, with recurrence rates of 18.75%, 21.88% and 31.25%, respectively. The difference in recurrence rates between the three groups was statistically significant (χ2 = 7.433, p=0.024). Among them, the recurrence rate of the combination group and the glucocorticoids group was lower than that of the control group (p < 0.05), whereas there was no significant difference in the recurrence rate between the combination group and the glucocorticoids group (p > 0.05).
        
        
          3.1.6. Comparison of Breast Appearance After Treatment
          The comparison results of breast appearance post-treatment showed statistically significant differences in the good-to-excellent rate of breast appearance among the three groups (χ2 = 45.366, p < 0.001), with 84.38% in the CHQGT combination group, 64.38% in the glucocorticoids combination group and 48.75% in the control group. Pairwise comparisons indicated that the good-to-excellent rate of breast appearance in the CHQGT combination group and glucocorticoids combination group was significantly higher than that in the control group (Table 5). Changes in the typical appearance of the breast after treatment are shown in Figure 3.

          3.2.1. Target Network Analysis of Bupleurum Qinggan Decoction and IGM
          A total of 199 active ingredients, 293 active ingredient targets and 79 IGM disease-related targets were obtained after screening, of which 23 were active ingredient and disease intersection targets (Figure 4). A total of 478 nodes and 4374 edges were obtained using Cytoscape 3.9.1 to construct the network of Bupleurum Qinggan decoction and IGM, and Network Analyser was used to analyse the topological parameters of PPI. Ranked by Degree value, the top 5 active pharmaceutical ingredients were quercetin (MOL000098, quercetin), kaempferol (MOL000422), β-sitosterol (MOL000358, beta-sitosterol), stigmasterol (MOL000449) and baicalein (MOL000173, wogonin) (Figure 5). It is speculated that the Bupleurum Qinggan decoction may play a key role in the treatment of IGM through the above active ingredients.
        
        
          3.2.2. Analysis of Core Targets of Bupleurum Qinggan Decoction in the Treatment of IGM and Construction of PPI Network
          A total of 23 intersecting targets were imported into the STRING database for PPI network analysis, and 23 nodes and 163 edges were obtained after screening (Figure 6). The results were imported into Cytoscape 3.9.1, and the PPI topological parameters were analysed using Network Analyzer. The top 10 nodes were selected as the core targets, namely interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), albumin, IL-1β, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, IL-4, interferon gamma and CRP, and the visual network diagram was created (Figure 7). It is speculated that the Bupleurum Qinggan decoction acts on the above targets and plays a role in the treatment of IGM.
        
        
          3.2.3. GO Enrichment Analysis and KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analysis
          A total of 23 drug-disease intersection targets were imported into the DAVID database for GO enrichment analysis, and p < 0.05 was used as the screening condition, with a total of 129 items for BP enrichment, 9 items for CC enrichment and 13 items for MF enrichment. The results showed that BP mainly included inflammatory response, positive regulation of gene expression, cellular response to lipopolysaccharide and positive regulation of DNA transcription. Moreover, CC mainly includes extracellular space, extracellular region, exosomes and plasma membrane, and MF mainly includes protein binding, identical protein binding, cytokine activity, enzyme binding and receptor binding. We constructed a KEGG functional enrichment map based on the count of disease-related genes or proteins (Figure 8), which primarily included 15 core signaling pathways such as IL-17, toll-like receptors, cytokine receptor interactions, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and TNF.
        
        
          3.2.4. Connection Between the Main Active Ingredients of Bupleurum Qinggan Decoction and the Molecules of Key Targets
          According to the results of network pharmacology analysis, the top 5 active ingredients with the highest degree value were quercetin (MOL000098), kaempferol (MOL000422), β-sitosterol (MOL000358, beta-sitosterol), stigmasterol (MOL000449) and baicalein (MOL000173, wogonin), along with IL-6 (PDBID: 1ALU), TNF (PDBID: 2E7A), IL-1β (PDBID: 6I8Y), CXCL8 (PDBID: 6N2U), STAT3 (PDBID: 6NJ2) and IL-4 (PDBID: 2D48). The binding energy of the key active ingredients and the core target was ≤ −5.0 kJ/mol.
        
      
    
    
      4. Discussion
      Corticosteroid treatment is considered the primary treatment for IGM. Prednisone, in particular, is a commonly used medication for the clinical management of IGM and belongs to the corticosteroid class. It can control the expression of cell adhesion molecules and, once inside the body, can transform into potent metabolic products. These properties allow it to prevent the adhesion of inflammatory cells and exert anti-inflammatory effects [37]. Prednisone can also influence the activity of arginase and NF-κB, inhibiting the maturation and differentiation of peripheral dendritic cells, obstructing signal transmission and nuclear transcription in lymphocytes and controlling lymphocyte-mediated immune responses [38]. Using prednisone to treat IGM can effectively alleviate local inflammatory reactions in the breast [39]. In a randomised clinical trial, 30 patients with IGM underwent 2 months of prednisone treatment at different doses. It was found that the remission rate for the high-dose group (starting dose of 50 mg, halving the dose every 3 days to the same 5-mg dose as the low-dose group) was significantly higher than that for the low-dose group (93.3% vs. 53.3%, p=0.03). Among those who experienced remission, the relapse rate in the high-dose group was also significantly reduced (0% vs. 37.5%, p=0.04). This suggests that high-dose prednisone treatment for IGM has a higher success rate, a lower recurrence rate and reduces the need for surgery [40].
      Through precise ultrasound-guided puncture of the lesion, MWA adjusts the effective thermal field emitted by microwaves. Utilising the high temperatures generated by oscillations of water molecules within tissues, it can directly coagulate and denature the proteins of lesion cells, leading to the complete necrosis of the lesion tissue. Advantages of this method include sustained high temperatures, substantial tumour ablation, short operation time and low pain scores. Under ultrasound guidance, precise localisation can be achieved without missing the lesion. As the proteins of the lesion tissue denature at high temperatures, the immunogenicity of the lesion tissue is lost. Therefore, factors leading to IGM recurrence can be fundamentally eliminated. Thus, the combined use of MWA with glucocorticoids can further enhance the therapeutic effect and promote recovery. However, it is worth noting that prednisone has a series of adverse reactions, such as allergic reactions, weight gain, diarrhoea, lower limb edema and menstrual irregularities, which can affect treatment compliance to some extent.
      In ‘Surgery of Traditional Chinese Medicine' [24], the medication prescribed for acne-like breast abscess of the liver-heat type is CHQGT. This decoction can significantly improve the clinical symptoms of granulomatous mastitis, promote recovery, has minimal toxic side effects and a low relapse rate, and is relatively safe. Recent pharmacological research has shown that the effective components of Bupleurum are mainly saponins, flavonoids and lignans. Bupleurum (Chai Hu) can inhibit the release of inflammatory mediators, the growth of granulomas and antiexudation, as well as suppress the elevating capillary permeability caused by histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine. It also significantly inhibits other inflammatory responses, such as leukocyte migration and connective tissue proliferation [41]. Recent pharmacological studies indicate that Bupleurum has immunomodulatory effects, which may be realised through the regulation of the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway [42]. Flavonoid compounds are the main active ingredients in Scutellaria, exhibiting antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumour properties, with inhibitory effects on both acute and chronic inflammation [43]. Yang Jiangping [44] stated that the combination of Bupleurum and Scutellaria has a synergistic effect, enhancing antipyretic results. This might be related to the regulation of central body temperature, adjusting prostaglandin E2 and cAMP, and inhibiting endogenous pyrogens TNF-α and beta-endorphin synthesis or release. Forsythia possesses anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, hepatoprotective and antitumour actions [45]. Through observing the antibacterial effects of multiple herbal decoctions on Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro, Ye Guanlong [46] discovered that Forsythia inhibits the bacterium in vitro. Burdock seeds exhibit antioxidant properties and play roles in anti-inflammation, antibacterial activity and pain relief. Their effective ingredients, coumaric acid and chlorogenic acid, show potent antibacterial activities, especially noteworthy for their inhibitory effects on Shigella dysenteriae [47]. Trichosanthin primarily contains polysaccharides, proteins, saponins, amino acids and other effective components. It displays a range of pharmacological activities, including antitumour, anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antibacterial effects. The polysaccharides in Trichosanthin can promote the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6, significantly enhancing immune activity [48]. The main effective ingredient in Gardenia, geniposide, can restore the dynamic balance of pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines, regulate immune cell function and activation, reduce the production of inflammatory mediators and inflammatory factors, and adjust various signalling pathways to exert anti-infection and immune-regulating effects [49]. Saposhnikovia divaricata (commonly known as Fangfeng) possesses pharmacological activities such as antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antitumour effects.
      In this study, there was no statistically significant difference in therapeutic efficacy between the CHQGT combination group and the glucocorticoids combined group. However, the former had a shorter duration of disease. This suggests that the combination of CHQGT and MWA can effectively reduce toxic side effects experienced by patients during treatment while improving the condition of the breast shape. In the VAS score comparison, the CHQGT combination group had a lower score than the glucocorticoids combined group at 1 and 3 months, with no difference at 5 months, indicating that the combination can more rapidly alleviate patient discomfort in the early stages of treatment. At 3 and 5 months, the lump size reduction rate in the CHQGT combination group was higher than that in the glucocorticoids combined group.
      At present, the main nonsurgical treatment of IGM is steroid hormone therapy, which has good anti-inflammatory, antiallergic and immunosuppressive effects, and can play a role in reducing the lump and the pain when used rationally. However, the dosage and duration of glucocorticoids remain controversial, and the adverse reactions caused by the use of glucocorticoids, such as Cushing's syndrome (central obesity, moon face, hirsutism, etc.), glucose metabolism disorders, abnormal blood pressure and peptic ulcers, mean patients often have poor compliance. On the basis of this study, we can promote the CHQGT treatment model in patients with IGM, which can shorten the length of hospital stay and reduce adverse effects.
      This study has certain limitations. First, being a single-centre study, it was challenging to ensure consistent baselines when comparing cohorts, and patients may have had other comorbidities that affected the prognosis. At the same time, due to the limitation of funding and other factors, this study could only adopt the convenience sampling method, and although the relevant baseline data of the enrolled patients were compared, it was still difficult to eliminate the influence of potential confounding factors. As such, multistage stratified random sampling will be used in the follow-up study to conduct relevant research. Second, due to the inconsistent forms of medications, the researchers had to further examine and inquire about the patients' specific medication intake; this study does not adhere to the double-blind principle. Third, for medical ethical reasons and patient medical needs, the enrolled participants were all patients who required drug intervention, making it impossible to establish a blank control group. Last, there is no unified consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of this disease; it remains a contentious point among breast specialists in various regions and a challenge in clinical treatment. High-level evidence supporting different treatment methods is lacking, warranting more in-depth, comprehensive research to devise optimal strategies and establish effective treatment guidelines.
      In summary, the combination of CHQGT and MWA is comparable to glucocorticoids combined with MWA in overall efficacy. The CHQGT treatment is superior in terms of reducing tumours, reducing patient pain and accelerating recovery.

Title: Shame and disgust in patients with inflammatory skin diseases: a systematic review of psychological correlates and psychotherapeutic approaches

Abstract: IntroductionSkin diseases are among the most common diseases worldwide and can cause severe psychological and social impairments. Negative self-directed emotions like shame and disgust may be important in the development and progression of these diseases, and thus, patients may benefit from psychotherapeutic approaches targeting shame and self-disgust. The first aim of this systematic review is to investigate the existing literature regarding shame and disgust as psychological correlates of inflammatory skin diseases. The second aim is to review the existing literature concerning the evidence of the efficacy of mindfulness-based and compassion-based therapy for alleviating shame and self-disgust in the context of skin diseases.MethodsTherefore, we carried out a systematic literature review via the databases PubMed, Web of Science and PSYINDEX.Results46 manuscripts were included in this review. Research shows that acne vulgaris, psoriasis, and atopic eczema are accompanied by a severe psychosocial burden, shame, and self-disgust, often due to highly visible skin lesions in affected patients. The use of mindfulness-based and compassion-based approaches is already being studied to address the experiences of shame and disgust due to these diseases, and initial promising results indicate that they can be considered beneficial in the holistic therapy of skin diseases.DiscussionThis systematic review shows that skin disorders have a significant psychosocial impact, leading to shame and self-disgust, especially due to the manifestation of visible skin lesions in affected patients. Mindfulness- and compassion-based approaches are currently being studied as potential treatments for the psychosocial impacts of skin diseases, and show promising results in addressing affected patients’ psychological burden.

      1 Introduction
      Skin diseases, including fungal skin diseases, other skin and subcutaneous conditions, and acne, ranked among the top ten most common diseases worldwide in 2010 (1). In a study involving 90,880 employees conducted from 2004 to 2009, 3.9% had acne vulgaris, 2% had psoriasis, and 1.3% had atopic eczema (2), making these inflammatory dermatological conditions three of the most prevalent skin diseases. A British report revealed that 14% of surveyed dermatological patients reported that their skin conditions were exacerbated by psychological factors, while 85% noted that the interference with their social relationships was the most distressing aspect of their illness (3). Importantly, the study highlighted a notably higher suicide rate among patients with inflammatory skin diseases, surpassing that in the general population (4). 17% of surveyed dermatological patients required psychotherapeutic treatment (3).
      
        1.1 The emotional consequences of skin diseases: disgust and shame
        Rook and Wilkinson (5) already argued in the late 1970s that “[.] the role of emotional factors on diseases of the skin is of such significance that, if they are ignored, the effective management of at least 40% of the patients attending departments of dermatology is impossible” (6). From an evolutionary standpoint, Kellett and Gilbert (7) center their focus on self-related negative emotions like shame and disgust. Their bio-psycho-social model, as depicted in Figure 1, serves as the foundation for this systematic review. They argue that acne’s development and progression stem from a combination of genetic factors and the stressors of puberty. The authors propose that when acne symptoms become prominent, individuals experience negative thoughts and emotions, especially related to the self, along with social challenges. These internal struggles and interpersonal issues adversely affect mood, behavior, and immune system function, further impacting stress levels, acne symptoms, and the emergence of additional psychological problems. The bio-psycho-social model of acne (Figure 1) can also be applied to the clinical presentation of psoriasis and atopic eczema, as all three conditions involve inflammatory skin issues that can negatively impact social life, emotional and psychological wellbeing. The connection of stress, social factors, and negative emotions with skin diseases is supported by evidence (6, 8), while a systematic review on shame and self-disgust in skin diseases is lacking.

        The basic human emotion of disgust is described as a form of rejection that arises from the need to distance oneself from a contaminated stimulus and is characterized by feelings of nausea and revulsion (9). Disgust is considered to be an adaptive emotion, which is an evolved response to objects in the environment that pose a (perceived) threat in terms of contagion through infectious diseases (10). Self-disgust describes feelings of reluctance and repulsion directed against specific aspects of one’s own person (11), whereas (general) shame is believed to be an incapacitating emotion that is accompanied by the feeling of being small, inferior, and of “shrinking,” whereby the self, as a whole, is devalued and considered to be inadequate, incompetent, and worthless (12). Shame is viewed from a more differentiated perspective, and a distinction is made between external and internal shame. External shame refers to the experience of the self as existing negatively in the minds of others, and thus as having visible deficits, failures, or mistakes (13). Internal shame, by contrast, is linked to the inner dynamics of the self and one’s judgements and evaluations (13). The distinction between shame and embarrassment is debated, with researchers suggesting distinctions in terms of intensity of affect, severity of transgression or patterns of attribution to the presented (embarrassment) vs. the core (shame) self (14). However, despite empirical evidence for their distinctness (15, 16), shame and embarrassment are not always distinguished unequivocally, and, as a result, when many researchers speak of embarrassment, it is more accurate to think of shame (17).
        Shame in the context of skin disease may arise from the experience of stigma (18). Stigma refers both to social reactions to attributes seen as degrading or devaluating (e.g., blemished skin), and to the internalization of such devaluation, termed self-stigma (19). Self-stigma and shame are thus closely related, both involving the devaluation of self, and are sometimes used interchangeably (20, 21). The impacts of stigma in skin diseases have been reviewed elsewhere (18, 22), whereas shame and self-stigma have not been investigated separately in skin diseases.
        Kellett and Gilbert (7) also explore the impact of social difficulties and the importance of attractiveness on body shame reactions. In the context of body shame reactions, Gilbert (13) defines it as shame related to one’s own body, particularly concerning skin. In society, clear skin is idealized as a feature of “desirable individuals” (p. 10), and blemished or diseased skin can be perceived as a sign of poor overall health. Consequently, those affected may fear eliciting negative emotions like fear, anger, or disgust in others, potentially diminishing their desirability in various aspects, notably sexually.
        Despite the importance of shame and self-disgust for the connections between social challenges, wellbeing, and symptom exacerbation posited in the bio-psycho-social model, the influence of these emotions on the wellbeing and treatment of individuals with skin disorders has received limited attention. Thus, this paper’s primary goal is to review existing literature, specifically focusing on the evidence supporting shame and self-disgust as psychological consequences and potential enhancers of inflammatory skin diseases. Reviewing the evidence will help identify gaps in the literature and guide further research into the psychological burdens and treatment of patients with skin diseases.
      
      
        1.2 Psychotherapy for dermatological diseases
        In various studies with patients suffering from atopic eczema or psoriasis vulgaris, the beneficial effects of combined dermatological and psychosocial interventions on the improvement of the skin condition, reduction of scratching frequency, and psychosocial parameters have been demonstrated (23). Good results are also obtained in approaches like relaxation, breathing, and art therapy, or psychodynamic catathymic image perception (24). Cognitive therapies focus on the dysfunctional appraisal of stressful events (25). Most approaches, however, lack a focus on challenging emotions such as shame and self-disgust (23). Modern psychotherapy has increasingly embraced mindfulness techniques, derived from Buddhism, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based therapies (MBT). These approaches adapt mindfulness from Buddhism to promote acceptance of current situations, reduce mental distress, and enhance overall psychological wellbeing. Stress-related skin conditions can benefit from these mindfulness practices, as they help reduce the mental noise and foster wisdom, ultimately increasing tolerance to stress and improving skin health (26). Additionally, self-compassion, a key concept in compassion-focused therapy (CFT), involves viewing oneself kindly and empathetically during challenging times, recognizing the universality of suffering, and mindfully accepting it (27). Unlike shame, which entails self-devaluation and a harsh self-critical relationship, self-compassion nurtures a loving, understanding, and forgiving self-relationship (28). By promoting better self-regulation and motives to alleviate suffering, mindfulness and self-compassion interventions can effectively address pathological shame and self-disgust in the context of skin diseases. As such, the second objective of this study is to review existing literature on the scientific evidence for using compassion-based or mindfulness-based therapies to address self-disgust and shame in individuals with skin diseases.
      
    
    
      2 Materials and methods
      We chose a methodological approach based on the PRISMA statement (29) for study selection, systematic search and data synthesis. Ethics approval is not required for this type of research at our institution.
      
        2.1 Study selection
        Studies were selected using the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined prior to the literature search. Inclusion criterion 1 included studies investigating emotions of shame (or self-stigmatization or embarrassment) or self-disgust or experience of disgust in the context of (psycho-)dermatological diseases (psoriasis, acne, atopic eczema). Criterion 2 included studies investigating mindfulness-based or compassion-focused-therapy regarding the emotions shame or self-disgust in patients with dermatological diseases (psoriasis, acne, atopic eczema). We did not define any excluding design parameters and only included studies focusing on adult populations (≥ 18 year).
        Furthermore, we excluded pharmaceutical studies, quality assessments of clinical instruments or questionnaires, studies linking other types of emotions (e.g., nausea or anxiety) to skin diseases, and studies focusing on other types of dermatological diseases (e.g., sexually infectious diseases or skin picking). Additionally, as the effects of mindfulness interventions for improving quality of life (30) and experience of stigma in patients with skin diseases (18, 22) have recently been reviewed, studies with a primary focus on quality of life or stigmatization (without differentiating aspects of stigma) in the context of dermatological diseases were excluded. Studies examining mindfulness or self-compassion as traits or variables in therapy research were also excluded, a comprehensive review for the context of dermatological diseases was recently published (31). Studies examining compassion or mindfulness strategies outside of the context of dermatological diseases, or emotions of shame or disgust, were also excluded.
      
      
        2.2 Search strategy
        Based on our criteria, search terms were defined and combined logically to build a search operator. We used wildcards to include multiple concrete forms of the same word-stems: [(skin disease) OR (skin condition*) OR (disease risk) OR (dermatolog*) OR (acne) OR (eczema) OR (psoriasis)] AND {(shame) OR (disgust) OR (mindfulness) OR (compassion) OR (self-compassion) OR (bodily suffering) OR [(emotion*) AND (psycho*) AND (psychotherap*)] OR [(emotion*) AND (psycho*) AND (dermatolog*)]}. PubMed provides an option to add a NOT-operator. This was added for the following terms: NOT sexual abuse[Title/Abstract] NOT childhood[Title/Abstract] NOT dement*[Title/Abstract] NOT HIV/AIDS[Title/Abstract] NOT HIV[Title/Abstract] NOT breast cancer[Title]. The search results were combined using reference management software.
        The systematic search was conducted in January 2022 via the databases PubMed, Web of Science and PSYINDEX and yielded N = 6,505 studies (n = 2,097 Doublettes). One study [(32), retrieved via Google Scholar] was published later in 2022 and was subsequently added to the search results. One relevant study (32) was excluded by our search operator because it contained the word “childhood” in the abstract.
      
      
        2.3 Data synthesis
        The screening of the results was conducted between January and September 2022 (see Figure 2 for the PRISMA flow chart). A random selection of 496 studies was screened independently by all three reviewers based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined above. The remaining studies were split equally and randomly between the three reviewers and screened accordingly. The set of randomly selected studies was used to estimate the inter-rater reliability. Although all three reviewers agreed concerning a binary decision (in-/exclusion) for 96.6% of the studies, the inter-rater reliability of the study selection was weak (kfleiss = 0.359). Disagreements regarding the selection existed in the case of n = 17 studies and were discussed by all co-authors. Further inspection showed that two studies with relation to the quality of life also contained aspects of the emotion of embarrassment (33, 34) and were thus considered relevant. Furthermore, the inclusion and exclusion criteria related to social anxiety [included; (35, 36)], feelings of stigma [included; (35, 37, 38)], and skin picking [excluded; (39)] were interpreted differently by the reviewers. After discussing and resolving the disagreements, the agreement of study selection was 97.5% with substantial inter-rater reliability (kfleiss = 0.659). One study (40) was falsely excluded in the screening and included in the review process thanks to one reviewer’s comment. All studies for which reviewers were not able to resolve their disagreements were included in the next step of retrieving the full manuscripts.

        The full manuscripts of the remaining studies were subsequently retrieved. Studies were excluded if the full text was not available (n = 11), not written in English or German (n = 3), had a focus on skin disease or emotion that did not fit the inclusion criteria (n = 36), did not include an adult sample (n = 2), or investigated mindfulness and self-compassion as traits or not in relation to disgust or shame (n = 21). The main results across each group of studies were then summarized for a synthesis of the main outcomes.
      
      
        2.4 Risk of bias assessment
        The risk of bias was assessed independently using the NHLBI quality assessment tool (41). The tool consists of a catalog of questions that ask key questions about the internal validity of the respective study. There is a separate, suitable list of questions for each study type (controlled intervention studies, systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses, Observational Cohort, Case-Control Studies, etc.). Each point is queried with yes/no questions (unsuitable or non-answerable questions are answered with NA or “not reported”) and categorized as “good,” “fair” or “poor” (no quantification) according to predefined rules. Five independent reviewers rated the studies according to the applicable criteria. The detailed results of the risk of bias assessment can be found in the Supplementary Table 1. Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses often exhibited poor quality, raising concerns about the reliability of their findings. Controlled Intervention Studies, on the other hand, presented a heterogeneous picture ranging from poor to good quality, indicating the need for more standardized methodologies. Most studies fell within the category of Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. These studies demonstrated varying degrees of quality, generally falling within the fair to good range. Additionally, a selection of qualitative studies was also included in the analysis contributing to the diversity of the evidence base. Based on the COREQ-Assessment (42) they showed fair to good quality.
      
    
    
      3 Results
      
        3.1 Shame, embarrassment, and self-stigma in dermatological diseases
        Most of the literature that has examined shame, embarrassment, and self-stigma in dermatological conditions and that was included in the review comprised studies that examined patients with psoriasis. A total of 33 out of 46 included studies (72%) focussed exclusively or i.a., on psoriasis, while fewer studies focussing on acne (9 studies, 19%) or atopic eczema (4 studies 8.7%) were found.
        Several questionnaire studies show that people with skin diseases displayed high levels of shame (17, 43–46), albeit not general shame (47) [see review by (48)]; skin shame (48); social shame (49). In a cross-sectional study with 166 psoriasis patients, Jankowiak et al. (50) showed that higher levels of shame were especially found in cases with visible skin lesions [see review by (51)] and that older patients reported less shame.
        In addition, questionnaire studies found high levels of embarrassment (17, 33, 43, 45, 46, 52–55) associated with high self-consciousness about the skin disease (17, 56, 57), as well as high levels of self-stigma (17, 34, 58) in people with skin diseases. Again, visible lesions (e.g., scars) were associated with more embarrassment (59), and in psoriasis patients, this was even more acute than in people suffering from atopic eczema (60). Additionally, in a meta-analysis of ten qualitative studies of people with various dermatological conditions, emotional experience with embarrassment and shame emerged as one of the main themes (61). In one study, shame experience was also highlighted as the unifying factor between psoriasis and acne inversa patients in particular (62).
        Lahousen et al. (32) found that patients with psoriasis reported significantly higher levels of skin-related shame and disgust than healthy controls, as well as more negative appraisals of self-touching and parental touching. Interestingly, severity of skin condition was unrelated to shame and disgust. A qualitative study also found that people suffering from skin diseases had an impaired self-image and low self-esteem (17, 63, 64). In a study on sexual problems in psoriasis, the majority of men reported feeling embarrassed and less attractive due to skin lesions, and at least occasionally ashamed with sexual partners (65). Psoriasis patients often cited feelings of being stared at, and others’ erroneous beliefs that the disease was contagious, as stressors (65, 66). These feelings may cause avoidant behavior, thus perpetuating social exclusion and explaining the link between shame, stigmatization, and depression as well as lower quality of life (67).
        The study by Ginsburg and Link (37) showed that the fear of social exclusion harbored by psoriasis patients is not completely unjustified: 19% of patients experienced episodes of gross rejection as a result of their psoriasis. These experiences were accompanied by feelings of stigmatization. Magin et al. (68) also found embarrassment and low self-esteem as a result of teasing and bullying in people with dermatological conditions while Schielein et al. (69) showed that the main reason affected patients avoided sexual activity was shame and fear of rejection [see also (70)]. Since these feelings are fundamentally associated with social withdrawal and depression, Vladut and Kállay (71) call for multidisciplinary treatment in their review.
        In connection with psoriasis, Ginsburg and Link (38) worked out six dimensions of self-stigma via a questionnaire study: the anticipation of rejection, a feeling of being flawed, sensitivity to others’ attitudes, guilt and shame, secretiveness, and positive attitudes. The authors suggested that a high experience of stigma might be associated with increased non-compliance with treatment and thus symptom exacerbation.
        In a study by George et al. (72), what patients found helpful in dealing with the fear of social exclusion was active listening, shared decision-making, and communication of hope.
      
      
        3.2 Self-disgust and experience of disgust in dermatological diseases
        The state of research on disgust in dermatological diseases is considerably less comprehensive than that on shame and embarrassment. Mento et al. (73) also came to this conclusion in a literature review, according to which anger and disgust are neglected in studies. In a qualitative study, Wahl et al. (74) show that patients with psoriasis describe their bodies (especially in the case of visible skin rashes) as “offensive” and regard themselves as “unclean, infectious, disgusting, leprous, ugly, unattractive, strange, big, or different.” [see also (67)]. In an ethnographic qualitative study in different countries, dermatological patients described themselves with disgust and self-loathing (75).
        In a questionnaire study, over 60% of patients with psoriasis reported experiencing strong self-disgust (76), and the findings showed that sex, age, depression, and perceived stigmatization were predictors of self-disgust whereby the relationship between stigmatization and depression was mediated by self-disgust. Moreover, there is evidence that dermatological patients experience disgust in others differently from skin-healthy people. In an approach-avoidance task, patients with psoriasis and their significant others more strongly avoided faces displaying disgust, but not other emotions, compared to controls (40). In an fMRI study by Kleyn et al. (77), psoriasis patients showed a reduced ability to recall faces with disgust reactions compared to controls. The authors concluded that this related to learned coping mechanisms to protect themselves from the reaction of disgust in others.
      
      
        3.3 Psychotherapy for dermatological diseases: compassion-based-therapeutic approaches
        Although few studies to date have examined the effects of compassion-focused therapy on shame or disgust in skin conditions, empirical evidence supports the potential of CFT for reducing shame and enhancing treatment for patients with skin diseases. In a two-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) on 75 patients with facial acne who experienced skin-related distress and varying levels of depression, Kelly et al. (78) found that two compassion-focused interventions significantly reduced shame, as well as skin discomfort and depression, in comparison to a passive control. More mixed results were found in a four-week compassion focused self-help program (79). In this single-arm feasibility study with a small sample, two patients with initially high levels of shame and self-criticism reported significant reductions of shame and self-criticism at the end of the program, while two patients with relatively lower baseline levels experienced significantly increased levels of shame following the intervention (79). Thus, the limited evidence mostly supports the potential of CFT as an approach for individuals with skin diseases, particularly in reducing shame, self-criticism, and psychological distress.
      
      
        3.4 Psychotherapy for dermatological diseases: mindfulness-based therapeutic approaches
        For the effects of mindfulness-based approaches on shame and disgust in the context of skin disease, our search yielded only one study comparing MBT against CFT. In a feasibility RCT, Muftin et al. (80) tested a mindfulness self-help online program against a CFT program in 130 patients with psoriasis. Results showed that both four-week programs were acceptable and helpful in reducing shame and improving quality of life, suggesting that MBT may have comparable potential to CFT in alleviating shame and distress in patients with skin conditions.
      
    
    
      4 Discussion
      The primary goal of this systematic review was to search for evidence supporting that shame and self-disgust are psychological correlates of inflammatory skin diseases. The results provide strong evidence for shame, embarrassment, and self-stigma as significant aspects in dermatological conditions, particularly in individuals with psoriasis. In this line, patients often suffer from high emotional stress and social exclusion. Visible skin lesions increase the experience of shame, although older patients are often less affected. Shame and self-stigmatization do not necessarily correlate with the severity of the disease, but rather with the awareness of the skin problems and the social reactions to them. Patients report bullying, social exclusion, and misunderstandings about the degree of infection of the disease, which leads to social withdrawal and increased emotional distress. Sexual problems are also common and are associated with reduced self-esteem and shame. Results indicate that shame may contribute to symptom exacerbation via withdrawal and treatment non-compliance, though causal evidence is lacking.
      The evidence found on disgust as a concomitant of dermatological diseases is less extensive than on shame. The results indicate, however, that self-disgust is an emotional response associated with dermatologic diseases, particularly in relation to visible skin rashes.
      The second objective of the systematic review was to investigate the evidence for using compassion-based or mindfulness-based therapies to address self-disgust and shame in individuals with skin diseases. However, only three studies were found in total. The results on the effect of CFT-based therapy on shame and disgust in skin diseases are limited, but somewhat promising. At least there are already two RCT-studies that show that these interventions can reduce shame and skin discomfort in people with skin diseases.
      The results show that further exploration of self-disgust and perceived disgust in dermatology is needed to better understand its impact on the psychological wellbeing of patients and to develop effective interventions to address this aspect of the patient experience. The relation of shame and self-disgust with fear and experience of social rejection, and the link with treatment non-compliance, support the assumption of the bio-psycho-social model that negative self-directed emotions increase stress and, as a result, skin disease symptoms. Additionally, a mediating role of shame and disgust in the links between skin disease and depression or lower quality of life indicates that negative emotions increase patients’ psychological burdens and may be associated with less effective coping. Longitudinal studies are necessary to test the causal role of shame and disgust in disease progression. Further studies should also focus strongly on the initial promising effects of CFT and MBT on shame and disgust in skin conditions.
      While this systematic review provides valuable insights, several limitations should be considered. First, the overall quality of the included studies was moderate, with a particularly high risk of bias in many of the controlled intervention studies. Second, comparability across studies was limited due to substantial heterogeneity in both measurement instruments and the use of core constructs. As shown in Table 1, similar constructs such as “stigma,” “self-stigma,” and “self-disgust” were operationalized using more than 19 different instruments, reflecting inconsistent conceptualization across studies. Third, the number of intervention studies, especially randomized controlled trials, was low, which restricts the strength of conclusions regarding treatment effectiveness. Lastly, the wide publication span of the included studies (1982–2022) may have introduced cohort effects, potentially contributing to variability in findings.

      In conclusion, the findings of this review align with the adapted biopsychosocial model of skin disease progression. Patients with the three included inflammatory skin diseases are burdened by shame and self-disgust —central emotional responses to negative self-appraisal and social rejection—which are often related to experiences and fear of social rejection. These processes mirror the model’s pathways from skin conditions to negative self-related emotions, social difficulties, and increased arousal, though causal evidence is lacking. Mindfulness- and compassion-based approaches appear promising in addressing these shame and self-disgust and improving patient outcomes.

Title: Self-determined strategies for physical activity motivation among women with polycystic ovary syndrome

Abstract: Background:According to clinical practice guidelines for polycystic ovary syndrome, first-line treatment includes performing 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on most days of the week plus at least 2 days of resistance training. However, <40% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome engage in regular physical activity, and about 60% are sedentary. Research evidence supports theory-informed physical activity interventions to improve motivation for physical activity. This study examined the fit of a behavioral change theory for women with polycystic ovary syndrome.Objectives:The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze physical activity barriers through the lens of self-determination theory and identify motivational strategies that may promote initiation and maintenance of physical activity among women with polycystic ovary syndrome.Design:The study involved a qualitative, descriptive design using theory-driven thematic analysis.Methods:After emailing a demographic questionnaire and Personal Health Questionnaire-8 to screen for depressive symptoms, participants (n = 7) met three times via Zoom during the summer of 2021. Meetings were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed.Results:Participants were aged 33.9 (±8.1) years, premenopausal, mostly White (71%), educated (100% with at least some college), employed full-time (86%), and married (86%) with a mean depressive symptoms score of 6.4 (±3.4) indicating mild depression. Strategies such as a buddy system, physician support, technology, and behavioral change techniques are necessary to meet the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness among women with polycystic ovary syndrome to help increase exercise motivation.Conclusion:Findings supported the use of self-determination theory by emphasizing that the social context of polycystic ovary syndrome can undermine physical activity behavior. Thus, physical activity interventions should consider the social context, peer support system, and mental health status of women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and include tailored programs and motivational strategies to help meet the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

Body: Introduction
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrinopathy among women,
1
 affects about 20 million women in the United States across all races and ethnicities.
2
 PCOS is a complex, heterogenous collection of symptoms involving hormonal dysregulation.
1
 Diagnosis of PCOS occurs when two of three of the following conditions are present: menstrual irregularities, clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and/or polycystic ovarian morphology.
3
 PCOS is associated with central adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and depressive symptoms, placing the women at risk for cardiometabolic diseases, reproductive cancers,
4
 and psychological morbidity.
5
 Women with PCOS are three to eight times more likely to have depressive symptoms
6
 and seven times more likely to attempt suicide
7
 than women without PCOS.
      Physical activity (PA) has been well-established as a therapy for managing PCOS symptoms and reducing the risk of comorbidities.
3
 PA is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles requiring energy expenditure.
8
 PA includes exercise, both aerobic and resistance, which is planned, structured bodily movement with a fitness goal.
8
 As such, the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice PCOS Guidelines recommend that women with PCOS follow the PA guideline of 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity to prevent or delay the onset of comorbidities, as well as improve cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass index, and quality-of-life.3,8 Resistance exercise is recommended on at least 2 days/week,
3
 as it has been shown to increase metabolic capacity via increased lean mass, reduce insulin resistance, and increase bone mineral density,9,10 while reducing depressive symptoms among those with and without clinical depression, and more in women with PCOS than in women without PCOS.3,9
–15 However, <40% of women with PCOS engage in regular PA, and about 60% are sedentary.16,17
      PCOS-specific PA barriers have been reported as stigma-related stress due to appearance (e.g. hirsutism, obesity), symptom burden (e.g. depressive symptoms, fatigue), and lack of understanding of the condition by society in general, time, and confidence.18,19 These barriers impede motivation to exercise, especially in group-based and public settings, necessitating a search for effective and meaningful strategies to improve motivation. Research evidence supports interventions underpinned by theory and inclusive of psychological support.
20
 Motivation determines the initiation and maintenance of PA, as motivation drives all aspects of intention, activation, and persistence of goal-directed behavior.
21
 Interventions informed by self-determination theory (SDT) have growing evidence of improving motivation by identifying supports that help meet psychological needs.
22
 When psychological needs are met, people attain more intrinsic motivation to exercise, which may lead to behavioral engagement.22
–25 Thus, the purposes of this qualitative descriptive study were to explore PA barriers through the lens of SDT and identify motivational strategies that may promote the initiation and maintenance of PA among women with PCOS.
    
    
      Theoretical framework
      The science of health behavior change has increasingly emphasized theory-based approaches to intervention, as theories help identify underlying mechanisms of action and proximal targets of intervention (i.e. mediators and moderators).21,22 SDT, as introduced by Ryan and Deci, is a metatheory for the study of human motivation, personality development, and well-being.
23
 The underlying assumption of SDT is that humans not only are naturally inspired and agentic, but also require social supports or strategies to develop and maintain natural potential and well-being. SDT intersects personality and social context to predict the likelihood of adopting and maintaining a behavior, such as PA, by predominantly focusing on a taxonomy of motivations and three innate psychological needs.
      SDT was chosen as the lens for structuring the study, given its focus on motivation within unique social contexts. SDT explains that social norms may suppress an individual’s innate psychological needs of autonomy (freedom to choose a behavior), competence (ability to perform and master a behavior), and relatedness (sense of belonginess).
23
 Unmet needs suppress natural self-governing and create a shift in motivation away from self-determined behavior to more externally motivated behavior. Furthermore, based on SDT, individuals with decreased motivation require multiple strategies to improve need satisfaction. Thus, the extent to which people meet these psychological needs dictates their position on the continuum of motivation. Researchers that have employed an SDT perspective found that self-determination and motivational orientation, along with self-efficacy, offered an appropriate framework to further understand PA behavior among those with chronic health conditions

      Materials and methods
      
        Design and ethics approval
        A qualitative descriptive study was conducted from May 2021 to December 2021. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and 45 CFR 46.104(d)(2) and 45 CFR 46.111(a)(7). The University of South Carolina (USC) Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study (Pro00105265, December 7, 2020). As approved by the USC IRB, verbal consent was obtained from participants prior to each virtual meeting. The interviewer was supported by NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award (1F31 NR019206-01A1).
      
      
        Study setting and sample
        A focus group was formed of women with PCOS (n = 7) to analyze exercise barriers through the lens of SDT and identify motivational strategies that may promote initiation and maintenance of PA among women with PCOS from the perspective of women with PCOS. Our recruitment goal was for 6–10 individuals to keep the group size manageable and its participants comfortable sharing their expertise while also achieving diversity of opinion. Participants were recruited using the snowball method and social media, which allowed for a wider geographic reach and more diversity among a small group of participants. The researchers had no previous relationships with the participants. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was conducted virtually and used secure email to distribute and collect surveys.
      
      
        Inclusion/exclusion criteria
        Eligibility criteria were premenopausal women with a confirmed diagnosis of PCOS by a healthcare provider, an age of 18–42 years, and internet access for virtual meetings. Potential participants were required to submit via secured email confirmation of a PCOS diagnosis by a healthcare provider to be considered for the study. The age range was chosen based on a systematic review and meta-analysis that defined the start of the menopausal transition for women with PCOS at or greater than the age 45 years.
27

      
      
        Measures
        
          Demographics
          The demographic questionnaire included age, race, geographic location, educational attainment, employment and insurance status, marital status, number of children, height, weight, and comorbidities (see Supplemental Appendix A).
        
        
          Depressive symptoms
          The Personal Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) is one of several tools used to assess depressive symptoms among women with PCOS in previous studies, and it has been recommended for symptom monitoring among patients with medical (versus psychiatric) diagnoses.
28
 As such, the PHQ-8 was used to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms experienced within the past 2 weeks. The PHQ-8 consists of eight items with a four-point rating ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). As a screening instrument, PHQ-8 scores suggest potential levels depression based on the number of depressive symptoms: 5–9 mild, 10–19 moderate, and ⩾20 major.
29
 Construct validity was reported at 0.75 and internal reliability was reported at 0.81.
29

        
      
      
        Virtual meetings
        The focus group met three times for ~1 h/meeting. The virtual meetings took place during the summer months spaced apart by ~3 weeks. The researcher (P.J.W.) introduced the purpose of the focus group. Meetings were structured by using an SDT-informed interview guide (see Supplemental Appendix B) created by the first author (P.J.W.), a doctoral-prepared female nurse researcher with experience working with and recruiting women with PCOS, and the second author (R.M.D.), a female qualitative methodologist and nurse practitioner familiar with PCOS medical management. Interview guides were specifically developed to address knowledge, facilitators, and barriers of PA,19,30 SDT psychological needs,
23
 and strategies to increase motivation. Meetings were conducted by P.J.W. and audio-recorded via Zoom, a cloud-based videoconferencing service. Zoom offers the ability to communicate in real-time with participants in different geographic locations via computer or mobile device. This platform was chosen because it has several privacy features including user authentication, secure recording and storage, and real-time meeting encryption. Field notes were made during the focus group meetings. The recordings were transcribed and then compared to the audio to ensure that they accurately represented the participants’ discussion. Each participant received a $20 e-gift card per meeting for their time and expertise.
      
      
        Data analysis
        Using theory-driven thematic analysis,
31
 the data were organized and categorized based on predetermined themes drawn from SDT. Two researchers (P.J.W. and R.M.D.) independently coded the responses using deductive reasoning according to the three SDT psychological needs. Subsequently, an iterative categorization process was followed to organize data according to theoretical constructs. The two researchers discussed data saturation and unanimously agreed that data saturation had been reached after the three focus group meetings. Rigor was strengthened through the reflexivity of the researchers via reflexive journaling and regular meetings to discuss personal experiences and knowledge of both PCOS and PA in relation to the statements of the focus group participants. Rigor was further enhanced by following COREQ guidelines
32
 (see Supplementary File).
      
    
    
      Results
      Participants (n = 7) represented three U.S. states (South Carolina, Georgia, and Texas) and four different counties in South Carolina, both rural and suburban. Participants were 33.9 (±8.1) years of age, mostly White (71%), married (86%), and employed full-time (86%). The participants’ mean depressive symptom score was 6.4 (±3.4), indicating “mild depression.” Participants’ characteristics are listed in Table 1.

      The PHQ-8 scores of the three participants who reported depression as a comorbidity corresponded.
      All focus group participants acknowledged the multiple health benefits of exercise. However, all reported being insufficiently active, that is, they did not regularly accumulate 150 min of moderate intensity PA most days of the week. All focus group participants reported using extrinsic motivation to make decisions about PA behavior. For example, one participant was motivated by incentives such as discounts on facility memberships and another participant was motivated by her physician’s guidance to lose weight. No participant represented amotivation nor fully self-determined intrinsic motivation. When asked to rank the SDT psychological needs in general, focus group participants unanimously agreed that relatedness was most important, with mixed responses about whether competence or autonomy would follow.
      Themes were deductively categorized by the three psychological needs of SDT. A fourth theme, motivational strategies, comprised focus group participants’ suggestions for improving exercise motivation. Quotes illuminating the themes are italicized and presented as stated by the focus group participants and are minimally edited for clarity (e.g. removal of dysfluencies). Participants’ initial and age follow each quote.
      
        Autonomy: And it was something else that hindered me
        Autonomy is the volitional choice and control of one’s behavior. Internal and external factors impact autonomy by creating shifts in perception of priorities. The women filled multiple roles (e.g. spouse, mother, daughter, employee, student, patient), resulting in daily competing time demands. As a result, the women felt a loss of control in their ability to schedule time for PA: My barrier is time.
        
Life just got in the way. (M, 41)Other barriers, children, family, school, blah, blah, blah, blah get in the way. (C, 37)My biggest struggle is making the time and making that a priority over other things. (S, 29)

        As women who struggle with PCOS, some women expressed being robbed of choice due to comorbid conditions, such as hidradenitis suppurativa (inflamed and infected sweat glands; n = 1) and depression (n = 3).
        
Other factors that go with PCOS impede physical activity. Hidradenitis suppurativa is one of those factors. So the sweat glands may become clogged, they break out into boils and they have to be surgically removed. So the more you sweat, the more there’s pain. (M, 42)It (PCOS) was affecting me mentally . . . so like depression and just like . . . hopelessness. Um, so, you know, I never exercised. (J, 23)

        Hyperandrogenism is a feature of PCOS with physical sequelae such as obesity, hirsutism, and acne. Several women expressed feeling “unattractive” and having poor self-image, which led to avoidance of PA in public places.
        
You hate your body and you feel fat all the time. (T, 24)

        Autonomous choices were also limited by facility location and costs.
        
And the next closest one (gym) is 30 minutes away. (C, 37)And so there’s also the monetary component to it as well. (M, 42)

      
      
        Competence: (Lack of weight loss) crushed my spirit. And, ever since then, I haven’t tried to do anything
        Competence involves the sense of mastery and self-efficacy of one’s behavior and the need to feel effective when performing that behavior. A person will more likely accomplish a task or meet a goal when feeling capable of successfully performing the related activities, or when the task results in the expected outcome.
        
[Exercise] gave me a sense of accomplishment. (J, 23)It’s (the body) working correctly and everything’s going great and you’re powerful, I think that’s the most rewarding thing about it. (S, 29)

        When one feels ineffective, incompetent, or unable to accomplish a task or goal, the effort may seem meaningless.
13

        
So I will not do a group because I have no rhythm. I can’t do anything like that. (M, 41)It’s depressing when you don’t see your results, you don’t want to try anymore. (C, 41)

        Focus group participants cited weight loss as the most salient reason to both start and stop a PA. Weight loss was prioritized based on body dissatisfaction and physician advice.
        
I want to lose weight. I don’t like my body. (C, 41)The doctor says, “Well just lose weight, a lot of your symptoms will be fixed.” Wouldn’t it be nice to know how? (M, 42)

      
      
        Relatedness: We are in it together
        Relatedness is the interpersonal dimension, reflecting the extent to which a person feels connected to and accepted by others and has caring relationships.
32

        
I can’t do it on my own. (S, 29)just like family in general or anyone who will just go on that journey with you (M, 41)

        Focus group participants explicitly stated the need for social contact(s) who can relate to or understand PCOS and its physical and mental consequences.
        
just someone who understands what you’re going through and who is someone who is also knowledgeable about PCOS. (C, 41)

        Participants discussed that groups, even groups with all women, were intimidating because they felt less feminine and less of a woman compared to others.
        
They don’t have it (PCOS) so they don’t get it. I compare myself to them and feel less of a woman. I’m big, have all this hair, can’t have a baby. (S, 29)

      
      
        Motivational Strategies: I’ve, like everybody, tried all kinds of different things and I’ve liked some and I’ve not liked some
        Focus group participants listed potential motivational strategies to promote and sustain PA as a healthy lifestyle behavior. For example, one participant stated that coaching (the support) increased her competence, which in turn enabled autonomy to make exercise choices that accommodated limited time and space. Each motivational support caters to one or more psychological needs. For example, the motivational support of people affects the need for relatedness; a service support affects the need for competence; the motivational support of technology mostly affects the need for autonomy, whereas the motivational support of behavioral change strategies affects all three needs. The motivational strategies presented by the focus group are listed in order of importance to the participants and with stated advantages and disadvantages of each in relation to general and PCOS-specific PA barriers (Table 3).

      Discussion
      Women with PCOS encounter general and PCOS-specific exercise barriers. According to SDT, the cultural context of PCOS necessitates meaningful motivational strategies to help meet psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In turn, as needs are met, motivation to engage in PA becomes more intrinsic. The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze PA barriers through the lens of SDT, a motivation theory, and identify motivational strategies that may promote PA initiation and maintenance from the perspective of women with PCOS. The discussion is organized by the three innate SDT psychological needs and then motivational strategies that may promote need satisfaction and increase PA motivation.
      
        Autonomy
        Focus group participants expressed that volitional choice to be physically active followed other priorities, such as family demands. The focus group participants detailed many competing time commitments. Although this is probably true for many people, the women with PCOS desired strategies to best incorporate PA given both life demands (e.g. family) and PCOS-specific needs (e.g. grooming rituals, physical comorbidities). The concept of little to no discretionary time to participate in activities that build social and human capital is referred to as time poverty.
33
 Time poverty encourages unhealthy behaviors, (e.g. buying fast food) which creates a cyclic pattern of defeat or learned helplessness.
33
 Time poverty is not necessarily a mismatch between responsibilities and available hours, but a mental outlook on the value of those hours.
33
 A creative way to “fund time” is changing perspective about the value of time, such as giving time a financial equivalent and then budgeting time and money together.
33

        Focus group participants described responsibilities beyond the traditional definition of paid employment, such as childrearing, caregiving for aging parents, and other family obligations. Women in developed and developing nations spend, respectively, an average of 2 and 3.4 times more hours per day than men on unpaid work shouldering the heaviest burden of cooking, cleaning, and caring for children and the elderly.
34
 This inequitable gender-based allocation of unpaid domestic work, representing “double-duty” for women who enter the workforce, often limits discretionary time for women and promotes self-neglect.
35
 While this finding is not unique to women with PCOS, other researchers reported that women with PCOS more strongly adhere to cultural female gender roles to reclaim a feminine identity.
36

        The systemic oppression of women via gender inequality is accompanied by restrictive gender norms dictating societal female expectations, including the gender-specific ideals permeated about a woman’s presentation and gender performativity.
37
 The focus group participants frequently mentioned hirsutism and obesity as PCOS aspects causing stigma-related stress. Pfister and Romer found similar results when they interviewed Danish women with PCOS, all who perceived their bodies as different from femininity norms.
38
 Negative self-evaluation of bodyweight and shape can lead to low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and social phobia.
39
 More and Phillips also found that body dissatisfaction led to less autonomous regulation among women, which led to less frequent PA.
40
 Lastly, several of the participants in the current study reported lack of autonomy due to physical and mental features imposed by PCOS (e.g. obesity, hidradenitis suppurativa, depressive symptoms). Some conditions could be circumvented by choosing alternative forms of PA. For example, the participant with hidradenitis suppurativa chose swimming versus traditional cardiovascular exercise such as walking to avoid hot environments and thus an aggravating factor of excessive perspiration. Recent meta-analyses indicate that PA can significantly improve psychological well-being among people with depressive symptoms.
8

However, focus group participants stated that depression caused lack of energy and drive to be physically active. Screening for depressive symptoms and providing resources may be an essential first step before prescribing PA as therapeutic management. Longitudinal studies assessing PA and subjective well-being have shown that greater well-being predicts maintained or increased activity over time,
41
 and that changes in leisure-time exercise predict changes in happiness.
42

      
      
        Competence
        Focus group participants relayed clinical encounters and public health messaging that issued absent or confusing directives for weight loss. Clinical guidance for weight loss often excludes accurate and more detailed information about the role of exercise for weight loss as PA alone will not produce quick weight loss.
43
 PA enhances the ability to lose weight over time but mostly confers metabolic benefits.
44
 Accurate and specific guidance about realistic goal expectations increases knowledge and builds self-efficacy.
        In addition to accurate and detailed information, individuals must experience success with a behavior to build confidence in their actions.
45
 Positive behavioral experiences build self-efficacy, which in turn facilitates perceived competence for the behavior.
45
 Goal reframing is one strategy to establish other expected and more immediate health outcomes such as improved endurance, increased strength, and improved sleep. Recognizing more immediate health outcomes as goals and subsequently meeting those goals increases the likelihood for sustained behavior change.
45
 Positive and informative feedback also increases perceived competence.
46

        Focus group participants reported physicians as a trusted source of information and competent care. However, physicians cite barriers to exercise counseling such as lack of clinical time, limited education about PA dosing, and the absence of a PA counseling protocol.
47

      
      
        Relatedness
        Several studies (correlational, longitudinal, experimental) revealed a strong positive correlation between sense of belongingness and life satisfaction and wellness.
48
 The focus group participants agreed. Focus group participants emphasized the need to be understood in the context of PCOS, which is consistent with previous literature about women with PCOS.
49
 Being socially connected is influential on psychological and emotional well-being and has a significant and positive influence on physical well-being and overall longevity.
50
 As social beings, people strive for social connection to feel accepted and supported and avoid isolation and loneliness. This sentiment was consistent with a series of experiments designed to examine types of social connection, in which people were motivated to perform a task based on “being understood” or “mere belonging.” Being understood was independent of casual acquaintance versus longstanding relationships with family or friends or one individual versus many people.
51
 Thus, strategies to enable relatedness for women with PCOS could include online peer support, a buddy system, or social support groups.
        Focus group participants ranked relatedness as the most important category when discussing motivational strategies to be more physically active. In a cross-sectional study of women with PCOS about PA perceptions, respondents reported a choice not to be physically active due to feelings of rejection, stigma, and isolation from a general lack of understanding from others about PCOS and its impact.
19
 In a similar study to ours, Dalgas et al. found that unmet needs of relatedness led to feelings of isolation and frustration that prohibited PA, especially in group settings.
52
 As the focus group participants discussed, relatedness is enhanced when there is understanding of PCOS specifically followed by consistent support from the source providing true understanding.
        The SDT literature emphasizes conducting a needs analysis to prioritize the psychological needs when designing tailored interventions for most populations.
53
 However, when considering the differential effects of the three psychological needs among women in general, relatedness contributed strongly to autonomy and competence while autonomy and competence did not impact relatedness. As such, behavioral interventions should consider prioritizing relatedness needs to affect all other needs and promote intervention efficacy among women with PCOS.,
      
      
        Interrelatedness of the psychological needs
        The three innate psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are also interrelated, as they each reinforce the other and work synergistically to contribute to overall well-being and promote more intrinsic motivation.
22

        
          Autonomy and competence
          Autonomy facilitates competence. As individuals choose behaviors that align with priorities and interests, they will invest time and effort in those activities or behaviors, leading to the development of competence. Conversely competence can enhance autonomy. As competence for a behavior increases, individuals are more likely to choose that behavior.
        
        
          Autonomy and relatedness
          Autonomy also involves the freedom to choose when and how to engage in social interactions. Voluntary social interactions are more likely to yield more authentic and meaningful connections with others. Perceived social support, especially types such as emotional and appraisal,
54
 can reinforce autonomous choice.
        
        
          Competence and relatedness
          Findings from information management research indicate that competence leads to knowledge sharing,
55
 which can create a sense of contribution to and connection with those receiving informational support.
56
 In turn, relatedness involves a social environment in which individuals can receive feedback, guidance, and support to fuel their competence and create reciprocal giving and mutual reciprocity.
57

        
      
      
        Motivational strategies
        Motivational strategies may serve to help meet one or more psychological needs. For example, a personal trainer (the support) may provide empathetic listening and feedback to meet both relatedness and competence needs. Whereas, a technological device, such as a smartwatch, may promote and individual to engage in PA through daily activity recording and self-competition, thus meeting the need of autonomy. Behavioral change strategies, such as proper goal setting, meet all three psychosocial needs, as a woman with PCOS must first choose a behavior (autonomy) which she feels confident to perform (competence) and then find one or more people or norms, or benchmarks for which to “compete” or compare (relatedness). The importance of relatedness for engaging in PA superseded autonomy and competence for this sample of women with PCOS. Focus group participants explicitly stated that they sought encouragement from strategies such as tips and success stories about PA and were more motivated by the support of people who had experiential or factual PCOS knowledge.
        Self-awareness is critical while traversing the dynamic life course.
58
 Behavioral self-regulation is the capacity to assess cognitive, affective, and/or behavioral responses to daily life in the context of a larger goal and adapt accordingly.
59
 Thus, motivational strategies may need to change or coexist to match life’s demands. For example, a woman with PCOS may benefit from a coach to enable competence and a technological device to promote accountability. The capacity to self-regulate and appropriately choose alternative motivational strategies are teachable skills. These skills could be taught by healthcare professionals, such as nurses or other ancillary staff.
      
      
        Implications for PA interventions and healthcare
        The findings of this qualitative study highlight implications for PA interventions for women with PCOS. SDT can be a suitable theory to underpin PA interventions to increase motivation for PA by recognizing the context of PCOS and including strategies to meet the women’s psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Developers of PA interventions, specifically within the health realm, could consider the comprehensive guides to SDT techniques complied by Teixeira et al.
46
 For example, to meet the need for autonomy, women with PCOS can be provided choice of activity and given responsibility to schedule the activity. Strategies to meet the need for competence could include goal setting, positive and process-focused feedback, and extrinsic rewards. The need for relatedness could include individual and/or group-level social support from peers with PCOS or healthcare professionals knowledgeable about PCOS. Such social support systems can provide women with PCOS understanding from others while avoiding stigma-related stress due to appearance.
        Healthcare professionals, as a trusted source of information, have a role in promoting PA to women with PCOS. They are in a unique position to recognize and reinforce healthy behaviors and the additional health-related outcomes from PA. Available resources, such as the “Exercise is Medicine,” an initiative launched by the American College of Sports Medicine in 2007, are available to healthcare providers. These resources include PA counseling scripts and PA protocols, thus enabling healthcare providers to prescribe PA as part of a treatment plan.
60
 One resource of the “Exercise is Medicine” initiative is the “PA level as a vital sign” strategy and form (https://www.exerciseismedicine.org/).
60
 Assessing PA as a vital sign at clinic visits could increase the value of PA among clinicians, encourage counseling about positive PA outcome expectations, and confirm the patients’ knowledge and efforts.
        Interventions that meet the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in PA for women with PCOS can lead to more autonomous motivation to be physically active. PA, performed regularly over time, will promote health outcomes by helping to manage PCOS symptoms and mitigating the risk of cardiometabolic health conditions.
      
      
        Limitations
        A limitation of this study was the small sample size of volunteer participants, which limits generalizability. Our recruitment goal was for 6–10 individuals to keep the group size manageable and the participants comfortable sharing their expertise while also achieving diversity of opinion. Additionally, the homogeneity the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics limits generalizability to the entire population of premenopausal women with PCOS. However, the statistics for demographics, PA, and body mass index matched those found in other U.S. studies of premenopausal women with PCOS, except for depressive symptomology. The participants, as a group, were categorized as having mild depressive symptomology compared to moderate in another U.S. PCOS study.
61
 Thus, the volunteer participants for this focus group may have been more motivated to meet and discuss PA and therefore may not be representative of the PCOS population. While the PHQ-8 scores were better than those in other U.S. studies involving women with PCOS, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the responses to the depressive symptom screening tool. None of the focus group participants were teenagers or women of peri-postmenopausal age or residing in other countries, further limiting generalizability to all women with PCOS. Some focus group participants (n = 3) were recruited from other PCOS studies, which can introduce bias, as these participants may be more interested in research. None of the participants reported meeting the guidelines for PA; however, they may have been more interested in PA as compared to the population of U.S. women with PCOS. A limitation was the lack of a validated tool to measure PA status among the participants. Due to COVID-19, meetings were held virtually. This was a strength as women from different geographic locations participated. However, one meeting was interrupted with technical challenges of a dropped call and pauses due to poor connectivity. Overall, the virtual platform was convenient and cost-effective, while providing an easier and more secure way to record and transcribe sessions. The data were collected in three virtual meetings, possibly limiting its depth. The interview guide was not pilot tested. The researchers analyzed each transcript immediately after meetings to check for data saturation. Only two researchers iteratively read all transcripts and worked to identify codes and sub-themes. However, a third researcher was available for any variance, and all authors reviewed the themes and supporting evidence.
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      PCOS is a chronic health condition requiring life-long management, and PA is a first-line treatment strategy. Enacting PA requires motivation. The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze PA barriers through the lens of SDT, a motivation theory, and identify strategies that may promote PA initiation and maintenance among women with PCOS.
      Findings from this study underscored that the cultural context of PCOS can undermine PA behavior. Motivational strategies can help meet the women’s psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness and promote PA adoption and maintenance. Assessments of cultural context and depressive symptoms, followed by skill-building (e.g. choosing alternative PA types and environmental settings), could precede a PA intervention to circumvent PA barriers. Lastly, focus group participants strongly emphasized the need to be understood by those who support their efforts to adopt and maintain PA. All focus group participants agreed that social support from one or more people with factual or experiential PCOS knowledge would enable motivation. Such motivational strategies could include a peer coach, a community support group, or an invested healthcare team to provide accountability and encouragement.

Title: Recognising cutaneous tuberculosis

Abstract: SummaryTuberculosis (TB) continues to be a leading cause of death in many countries, and also remains a significant concern in Germany, particularly due to migration. The diagnosis of rare cutaneous tuberculosis is challenging as it manifests in various clinical forms that resemble more common dermatological conditions.Especially in paucibacillary forms, gold‐standard diagnostic tests may yield negative results, complicating the identification of the disease. Therefore, a strong clinical suspicion based on the clinical presentation is essential for guiding further or repeated diagnostic evaluations.In this article, we present various forms of cutaneous tuberculosis, using excerpts from the image collection of the Department of Dermatology and Allergy at Biederstein, Technical University of Munich, to improve clinical recognition of cutaneous TB and raise awareness of this condition also as a potential differential diagnosis.

Body: CURRENT EPIDEMIOLOGY
      With 1.3 million deaths per year, tuberculosis is the second leading common infectious cause of death worldwide. Approximately 25% of the global population is latently infected; however, only 5%–10% develop tuberculosis requiring treatment. In 2022, 10.6 million new cases requiring treatment were reported.

 is a relatively rare manifestation. However, given the global disease burden of tuberculosis infections, this still accounts for at least 150,000 cases. In high‐prevalence countries, cutaneous TB accounts for approximately 2% of dermatology consultations. One‐third of patients with cutaneous TB also have systemic involvement, emphasizing the critical role of dermatologists in diagnosis.
      More than half of the world's tuberculosis cases occur in five countries: India, Indonesia, China, Pakistan, and the Philippines.
1
 Tuberculosis in Germany is mainly diagnosed in patients with a background of migration. In 2022, more than 4,000 new cases of tuberculosis were reported, 71% of which occurred in persons of foreign nationality.
5
,

 Tuberculosis control has been hindered in recent years not only by the HIV epidemic and antibiotic resistance, but also by the reallocation of attention and recources during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

      In 2022, $ 5.8 billion was invested in tuberculosis prevention and treatment globally–more than 10% less than in 2019. This decline may be linked to the recent increase in case numbers.
1


    
    
      PATHOGENESIS
      The most common causative agent of tuberculosis is Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis, followed by the less common M. bovis and the BCG bacillus (an attenuated M. bovis strain used for vaccination). These are aerobic, immobile, non‐spore‐forming, facultatively intracellular rod‐shaped bacteria.
      The high lipid content of the cell wall makes these tubercle bacilli highly resistant and accounts for their acid and alcohol fastness. In most cases, transmission is airborne. Intact skin acts as an effective protective barrier and tubercle bacilli can only penetrate through microtrauma.
10


      Within 6–8 weeks, the pathogen is either eliminated or encapsulated in individuals with a well‐functioning immune system. This initial phase is usually asymptomatic. Occasionally, an erythema nodosum (up to 10%) or flu‐like symptoms may occur.
11


      Immune status plays a critical role in shaping the clinical presentation of tuberculosis. The interaction between the immune system and Mycobacterium tuberculosis can result in bacterial elimination, containment by granuloma formation, or uncontrolled bacterial spread as seen in miliary tuberculosis. The defense mechanisms against Mycobacterium involve both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) play a key role in the innate immune response by recognizing pathogen‐associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and upregulating antimicrobial peptides.
12
, 
13
 Granuloma formation is a coordinated aggregation of various immune cells, primarily macrophages, which fuse into multinucleated giant cells, along with lymphocytes. Mycobacteria infect dendritic cells and macrophages, inhibiting phagosome maturation through serine/threonine kinases. By inactivating reactive oxygen species and preventing phagolysosome fusion, the tubercle bacilli can proliferate in this environment.
13
 An “effective” granuloma encapsulates the bacteria, shielding them while also preventing their spread. Among the lymphocyte subpopulations, interferon‐γ‐producing Th1 lymphocytes have proven to be crucial for controlling TB‐causing mycobacteria. Likewise, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), produced by Th1 cells and other immune cells, plays a key role in granuloma formation and the caseous necrosis characteristic of tuberculosis.
12
, 
14
 This process upregulates matrix metalloproteinases, which are key drivers of the distinctive tissue destruction seen in tuberculosis.
15
 In addition, Th17 cells play a significant role in the formation and maintenance of granulomas.
13
 The formation of granulomas is the body's attempt to control the infection. However, if the infection is not contained, it can lead to tissue damage and the characteristic symptoms of tuberculosis.
16


      Therefore, a “mature granuloma” represents a “stalemate” between the immune response and mycobacteria. Both immune status and nutritional conditions can significantly influence this balance. Likewise, the manifestations and severity of cutaneous tuberculosis are strongly shaped by the individual immune status of the patients.
    
    
      DIAGNOSIS
      The diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis includes immunological tests, direct pathogen detection methods, resistance testing, and dissemination assessment. A definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis requires pathogen detection by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Ideally, three 6‐mm punch biopsies should be taken from the lesion for culture, PCR, and histological examination.
17
, 
18
 Due to the slow replication rate, cultural growth takes 6–8 weeks, depending on the medium, and is always accompanied by antibiotic susceptibility testing.
19
, 
20
 Additionally, PCR, which is more reliable from fresh tissue, allows for pathogen detection as well as the identification of common resistance‐associated mutations.
17
 Acid‐fast bacilli can only be detected histologically once a sufficient bacterial load is present, for example, using Ziehl‐Neelsen staining, which explains the low sensitivity for the identification of TB in histological examinations.
      With a well‐functioning immune response, the body forms tuberculous granulomas composed of epithelioid cells and multinucleated Langerhans giant cells. At the center of these granulomas, caseous necrosis of varying extent is present, while the peripheral zone is characterized by surrounding lymphocytes. In contrast, with a weakened immune response, only a nonspecific inflammation is observed, initially dominated by neutrophilic granulocytes and gradually shifting toward a predominance of lymphocytes and macrophages over time.
21
, 
22


      In multibacillary TB, pathogen detection is usually successful, and immediate patient isolation is required. Paucibacillary forms cannot be reliably excluded even with negative staining, PCR, or culture results. Repeated testing may be necessary.
      The following two tests indicate whether the organism has already had an immunological response to tuberculosis: In the T‐SPOT test, circulating lymphocytes in the blood are incubated with antigens of the M. tuberculosis complex, and the release of interferon‐γ is then measured.
23
 The significantly more cost‐effective tuberculin skin test is a delayed‐type reaction to intradermally injected protein derivatives of mycobacteria. There is an inherent risk of false‐negative results in cases of immunodeficiency as well as false‐positive results after vaccinations when using the tuberculin skin test.
24


      The most important risk factor for tuberculosis is HIV infection; therefore, corresponding tests should also be conducted.
25


      For further diagnostic evaluation of disease spread, we refer to the guidelines.
    
    
      TREATMENT
      The treatment of cutaneous tuberculosis is identical to that of pulmonary tuberculosis. Here, too, susceptibility testing before initiating therapy is considered mandatory, for example using a PCR‐based rapid resistance testing method. For adults, the recommended standard therapy remains unchanged: Isoniazid (INH), rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide are administered in combination for 2 months, followed by a four‐month continuation phase with isoniazid and rifampin.
5
, 
25
 Regular monitoring of the most common side effects, such as hepatitis, neuritis, neuropathy, hyperuricemia, and thrombocytopenia, is required. The treatment regimen does not differentiate between tuberculids and other forms of cutaneous tuberculosis. A therapeutic response is expected within 4–6 weeks, with complete healing of the lesions occurring within 1–5 months.
22
, 
26
 While antibiotic resistance in tuberculosis is increasing worldwide, the situation in Germany has remained stable at a low level, with a resistance rate of 5.7% in 2022.
6


      Of particular concern is multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis (MDR‐TB), which is resistant to the two main drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. Treatment should be carried out in specialized tuberculosis centers. Currently, MDR‐TB is treated with a regimen of at least 6 months using bedaquiline, pretomanid, linezolid, and moxifloxacin (BPaLM regimen). Rifampin monoresistance is treated following the same protocol as MDR‐TB.
5


      In cases with complications or additional resistance, an individualized treatment regimen with at least four drugs from WHO Groups A to C should be administered for 18 months, based on the resistance profile.
27
 Additional resistance includes pre‐XDR‐TB, characterized by resistance to isoniazid, rifampin, and fluoroquinolones, as well as XDR‐TB, which also exhibits resistance to bedaquiline or linezolid.
      Even in second‐ and third‐line therapy, side effects must be actively monitored. In the case of abscessing forms, surgical debridement may be beneficial. Multibacillary forms with ulcerations and fistulas are considered open tuberculosis, and these patients should be isolated.
28
 After one month of adequate therapy, most patients are considered non‐infectious, similar to pulmonary TB.
29


    
    
      CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS
      Prior sensitization of the patient's organism to mycobacteria, the cellular immune response, the route of infection, and the virulence of the respective mycobacteria determine the clinical manifestations of cutaneous tuberculosis. Due to its complexity, various classifications of clinical manifestations exist (Table 1). The two major groups, multibacillary and paucibacillary forms, are highly dependent on the patient's cell‐mediated immunity. It is also crucial whether the initial contact with tuberculosis occurs through the skin (primary), whether a specific immune response has already developed and a primary complex has been established (post‐primary), or whether the condition represents an immunological reaction of the skin to organ tuberculosis (tuberculid). The clinical presentation of cutaneous tuberculosis is also determined by the route of infection, which may be exogenous by inoculation or endogenous via lymphatic, hematogenous, or per continuitatem spread.

        Primary tuberculous complex (tuberculous chancre)
        This initial contact with tubercle bacilli through direct penetration of the skin or mucosa is very rare, occurring in 0%–1% of cutaneous TB cases.
30
 Portals of entry include microtraumas, but preexisting dermatoses can also sufficiently impair the barrier function. This cutaneous primary infection, occurring in the absence of specific immunity, is primarily observed in children with close contact with tuberculosis patients.
        After 2–4 weeks, a painless, firm, inflammatory papule appears, which may progress to ulceration. Lymph node swelling typically occurs 3–8 weeks after infection, often followed by caseation, though this is not always present.
31


        Healing usually occurs within 3 to 12 months, leaving an atrophic scar. In particular, without treatment, progression to another clinical form of cutaneous tuberculosis is possible.
        
Differential diagnoses: Syphilitic primary lesion, swimming pool granuloma, nocardiosis, tularemia, actinomycosis, leishmaniasis, subcutaneous and opportunistic fungal infections.
      
      
        Ulcerative tuberculosis of skin and mucosa (Orificial tuberculosis)
        In patients without significant immunity and with open organ tuberculosis, autoinoculation may develop along natural body orifices. This rare form accounts for up to 2.1% of cutaneous tuberculosis cases.
30
, 
32


        Initially, an erythematous papule appears, which transforms into one or more punched‐out, non‐healing, soft ulcerations with skin or mucosal edema. The most common sites of bacterial seeding in cases of open pulmonary tuberculosis are the hard palate, tongue, and lips (Figure 1).
33

            Orificial tuberculosis with ulceration of the tongue resulting from the spread of pulmonary tuberculosis.
          
          
        
        Intestinal tuberculosis with perianal bacterial seeding, as well as urogenital tuberculosis with dissemination along the urinary tract, have also been observed. These often painful ulcerations can significantly impair eating, urination, or defecation, depending on their location.
        
Differential diagnoses: Ulcerative sexually transmitted infections, leishmaniasis, amebiasis, histoplasmosis, herpes simplex virus infection, squamous cell carcinoma, chronic recurrent aphthae, pemphigus vulgaris, acrodermatitis enteropathica, and irritant‐toxic dermatitis.
      
      
        Tuberculosis cutis colliquativa (Scrofuloderma)
        This form has a relatively high prevalence in endemic areas (71% vs. 2.8% in non‐endemic areas)
34
, 
35
 and primarily occurs in children and the elderly. It is defined by the contiguous spread of tubercle bacilli from a deep‐seated infectious focus to the skin. The most common source is a lymph node, classically in the neck (Figure 2a,c). However, scrofuloderma can also arise from infections in bones or joints (Figure 2b) or, rarely, from the testes. One or more cold abscesses develop, palpable as deep‐seated nodules, which eventually drain to the skin surface through fistulas and ulceration with caseous, purulent discharge. The ulcer margins often appear livid and undermined.

        Through scarred healing of old lesions while new ulcerations and fistulas continue to emerge, a striking clinical appearance can develop (Figure 2a). The scars have a suture‐like appearance. Secondary spread from the ulcer margins into the dermis is not uncommon, manifesting as lupus vulgaris.
        
Differential diagnoses: Tertiary syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum, subcutaneous or opportunistic fungal infections, other mycobacterial infections, actinomycosis, pyodermas, hidradenitis suppurativa, severe acne conglobata, and tumor metastases.
      
      
        Tuberculosis cutis miliaris disseminata (disseminated cutaneous tuberculosis)

 mainly occurring in HIV co‐infection (especially with CD4 < 100/µl)
38
 and in children.
        It is characterized by massive hematogenous dissemination and seeding of tubercle bacilli in the skin and multiple other organs.
        It is often associated with advanced pulmonary tuberculosis accompanied by pronounced B symptoms. The clinical spectrum is wide, presenting with numerous polymorphic papules, overlying vesicles and pustules, as well as necrosis or atrophic scarring. Lesions typically heal with scarring within 1–4 weeks. The trunk and extremities are primarily affected, though mucosal involvement is possible.
        
Differential diagnoses: Exanthems (infectious, parainfectious, or drug‐associated), secondary syphilis, varicella, rickettsiosis, pityriasis lichenoides variants, and Abt‐Letterer‐Siwe disease.
      
      
        Metastatic tuberculous abscesses (tuberculous gummas)
        Tuberculous gummas have primarily been reported in malnourished children or immunosuppressed adults, accounting for 0%–13% of cutaneous tuberculosis cases.
16
, 
39
 Hematogenous dissemination of tubercle bacilli is followed by local metastatic spread, leading to abscess formation, which may ulcerate or develop fistulas (Figure 3).
        
          FIGURE 3
          
            Tuberculous gumma appears as an abscess in the skin, without connection to deeper tissues.
          
          
        
        The clinical presentation may therefore resemble scrofuloderma, but tuberculous gummas are not connected to deeper infectious foci. Localized lymphadenopathy is usually absent.
        
Differential diagnoses: Infection with other mycobacteria, syphilitic gummas, subcutaneous or opportunistic fungal infections, hidradenitis suppurativa, and panniculitides.
      
    
    
      PAUCIBACILLARY FORMS
      
        Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis (butcher's wart tuberculosis)
        In cases of reinfection through the skin, tuberculosis verrucosa cutis develops in patients with prior exposure to tubercle bacilli and a well‐functioning immune system, accounting for 3%–19% of cutaneous tuberculosis cases.
35
, 
39


        Historically, the disease was more common in high‐risk occupations such as healthcare workers and butchers and was recognized as an occupational disease. Today, it primarily affects children. Through microtraumas, the bacilli can breach the protective skin barrier. Transmission may also occur via objects contaminated with infected saliva. Consequently, in addition to the hands, the feet, knees, and buttocks – common contact surfaces of the body – are most frequently affected.
21
, 
40


        Typically, the skin lesion initially appears as an asymptomatic, hyperkeratotic papule with an erythematous border, gradually developing into a reddish‐brown, verrucous plaque with a ring‐shaped or serpiginous growth pattern (Figure 4). Central atrophy or ulceration has also been reported.
41

(c) Close‐up of the big toe showing a livid plaque with scaly to hyperkeratotic deposits and pinpoint erosions.
          
          
        
        The course of the disease is highly chronic, though spontaneous healing may still occur after several years.
        
Differential diagnoses: Infections with other mycobacteria, verrucae vulgares, chronic vegetative pyodermas, chromomycosis, tertiary syphilis, hypertrophic lichen planus, squamous cell carcinoma, and keratoacanthoma.
      
      
        Lupus vulgaris
        In Europe, lupus vulgaris is the most common form of cutaneous tuberculosis, accounting for 4%–63% of cases.
16
 The intact immune system of affected patients is already sensitized to tuberculosis. In most cases, lupus vulgaris results from hematogenous dissemination and, less frequently, lymphatic spread of an internal organ tuberculosis to the skin. It may also, though much less commonly, be triggered by contiguous spread from scrofuloderma or by vaccination. Lupus vulgaris is characterized by a single, slowly expanding reddish‐brown plaque that develops over several years, most commonly on the face, neck, or legs. It presents with a raised border and overlying scaly crusts, as well as central atrophy and scarring (Figure 5).
42
 A sporotrichoid pattern may occur in cases with multiple lesions.
43
 If the lesions appear on mucous membranes, they present as gray‐white or glassy. In non‐hyperkeratotic areas, diascopy may reveal an apple jelly‐like appearance. This sign is not specific to the disease and is rarely visible in skin of colour. It is important to note the increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma in long‐standing, untreated lesions.

(c) Erythematous, partially glistening, and partially scaly plaque on the nose.
          
          
        
        
Differential diagnoses: Tertiary syphilis, subcutaneous fungal infections, leishmaniasis, porokeratosis, actinic keratosis, Bowen's disease, sarcoidosis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, and lichen planus.
      
      
        Tuberculosis mutilans
        In the advanced stage of lupus vulgaris, scarring and ulceration affect the skin, deeper connective tissue, and cartilage. The resulting contractures of the mouth, defects in the nasal or auricular cartilage with adhesions, or ectropion can lead to disfigurement (Figure 6). When the extremities are involved, this may result in movement restrictions and lymphatic obstruction.

        Tuberculids are a group of skin lesions that occur in the setting of active organ tuberculosis without anatomical proximity to the primary infection site. They occur in individuals with a well‐functioning immune system and are best understood as an immune reaction in the skin to the hematogenous dissemination of tubercle bacilli or their antigens.
44
 Initially, the reaction appears to be immune complex‐mediated, while in later stages, it seems to develop into granulomatous inflammatory responses.
        The pathogenesis of tuberculids remains a subject of debate. Notably, culture from the affected skin lesions is unsuccessful, whereas PCR is often positive. An active tuberculosis focus is frequently not identified, although interferon and tuberculin tests are usually strongly positive. While tuberculids resolve under antituberculous therapy, the anti‐inflammatory effects of antibiotics should also be considered.
18


        Currently, tuberculids include tuberculosis cutis lichenoides, papulonecrotic tuberculid, and erythema induratum of Bazin.
      
      
        Lichenoid cutaneous tuberculid (tuberculosis cutis lichenoides)
        In 72% of patients with a lichenoid tuberculid, systemic tuberculosis can be detected. Occurrence following BCG immunization has also been reported.
45
 Children and young adults are primarily affected, with a highly variable prevalence ranging from 0.1% of cutaneous tuberculosis cases in Japan to 33% in India.

46


        The lichenoid cutaneous tuberculid is characterized by numerous asymptomatic perifollicular reddish to yellowish‐brown papules with variable scaling. These lesions appear in grouped formations, often along Langer's lines on the trunk (Figure 7). Healing occurs without scarring.
47
 Histologically, granulomas are found around hair follicles and sweat gland ducts without caseation.

Differential diagnoses: Secondary syphilis, lichenoid exanthems, lichen nitidus, lichen planus, sarcoidosis, and keratosis pilaris.
      
      
        Papulonecrotic tuberculid
        Papulonecrotic tuberculid is seen mainly in children and young adults and accounts for 3% to 12.8% of cases of cutaneous tuberculosis.

        It presents symmetrically with recurrent episodes of livid‐erythematous papules that evolve into pustular and necrotic lesions. The asymptomatic lesions appear in different stages simultaneously and primarily affect the extremities and trunk (Figure 8). Atrophic scars remain after healing.
36
 Histologically, a leukocytoclastic or granulomatous vasculitis is observed.

Differential diagnoses: Small‐vessel vasculitides, lymphomatoid papulosis, and pityriasis lichenoides variants.
      
      
        Erythema induratum of Bazin
        Primarily affecting young women, erythema induratum of Bazin is more prevalent in Japan and China, accounting for 35%–40% of cutaneous tuberculosis cases.
46
 It is characterized by subcutaneous, livid‐erythematous nodules localized on both calves, which may undergo atrophy and ulceration, the latter of which is surprisingly painless (Figure 9).
48
 The frequently recurring lesions may heal within weeks to months, leaving behind atrophic hyperpigmentation and scars.

        Histologically, erythema induratum of Bazin initially presents as predominantly lobular panniculitis with vasculitis. Over time, a tuberculoid granuloma may develop.
49
 The same clinical and histological presentation without a confirmed association with tuberculosis is referred to as nodular vasculitis.
50


        
Differential diagnoses: Erythema nodosum, lupus erythematosus profundus, perniosis, other vasculitides, pyoderma gangrenosum, and sarcoidosis.
      
    
    
      CONCLUSIONS
      Recognition of cutaneous tuberculosis as a potential differential diagnosis is crucial for timely identification, isolation of multibacillary forms, and interruption of possible chains of infection. The often delayed diagnosis and treatment – due to its similarity to other dermatoses – may lead to scarring and increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma in lupus vulgaris, with malignant transformation occurring in 10% of long‐standing lesions.
      Cutaneous manifestations of tuberculosis may be indicative of systemic tuberculosis, therefore prompt recognition followed by the start of an appropriate treatment regime reduces the risk of patient morbidity and mortality.
      In cases of inadequate response to previous therapies and appropriate clinical presentation, cutaneous tuberculosis should still be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in immunosuppressed patients or those with a history of travel to high‐risk countries.

Title: Rationale and design of the GLADE study: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in endometriosis-related pelvic pain

Abstract: AbstractBackgroundPelvic pain secondary to endometriosis is a disabling condition. There are multiple treatments available, with variable endpoints. No prospective controlled studies were carried out evaluating subdermal pellets of gestrinone in this population.MethodsOne hundred participants with documented deep infiltrative endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either gestrinone 85 mg subdermal bioabsorbable pellets or placebo. Both arms will receive levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12). The treatment duration will be 6 months, with baseline, 3 months and 6 months clinical visits. The primary endpoint is a combination of serious adverse events (SAEs) accumulated within 6 months of insertion of the gestrinone or placebo pellet and collected through spontaneous reports and clinical findings. They include death, threat or risk to life, need for hospitalization, prolongation of pre-existing hospitalization, permanent disability or damage, congenital anomaly; or significant medical occurrences such as venous thromboembolism. The primary safety outcome will be the percentage of patients who do not experience SAEs 6 months after randomization. Androgenization, changes in laboratory exams and in pelvic pain intensity as well as quality of life (SF-36 and EHP-30 questionnaires) will be further evaluated. Daily data on uterine bleeding patterns and the use of pain relief medication will be remotely collected using an App. Pharmacokinetics profile of gestrinone pellet will be characterized.ConclusionThis is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile of subdermal gestrinone pellets and might inform clinical practice for treating these patients.Administrative InformationGLADE trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05570786). This is an investigator-initiated research supported by Biòs Farmacêutica.

Body: Introduction
      Pelvic pain is a disabling condition for women of reproductive age, negatively impacting their quality of life and work efficiency. Doctors frequently neglect it despite its estimated worldwide prevalence ranging from 5.6 to 26.6 [1,2]. Pelvic pain is considered a symptom of multifactorial origin in which endometriosis is the leading gynecological cause that affects 5–10% of women in their reproductive years. It means around 176 million women with endometriosis worldwide [3].
      Surgical and hormonal treatments with variable endpoints are available and are still considered a significant challenge for medicine. Recommendations from different medical guidelines for managing the disease include surgery or a combination of surgical and pharmacological strategies [4–6]. Hormone therapy includes progestogens, anti-progestogens, combined oral contraceptives, gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, GnRH antagonists, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), danazol and aromatase inhibitors. The choice of treatment for endometriosis must consider the severity of the symptoms, extent, and location of the lesions, comorbidities, age, intention to become pregnant, adverse drug events, and contraindications. Surgical treatment is indicated in the case of severe and disabling symptoms without improvement after the pharmacological treatment. However, post-surgery recurrence rate of painful symptoms is 21.5% after 2 year and 40–50% after 5 years of the surgery [4–6]. The direct costs for treatment of endometriosis are significant. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in 2021 registered 26,400 medical appointments and 8,000 hospitalizations for endometriosis with limited access to multifunctional teams specialized in endometriosis and longtime waiting for a surgery [7]. In this context, pharmacological treatment for endometriosis is prominent.
      A Cochrane Review about progestagens and anti-progestagens for pain associated with endometriosis showed gestrinone as anti-progestogen (i.e. a substance that prevents cells from making or using progesterone) and one of the first drugs for the treatment of endometriosis and myomas [8]. Gestrinone acts centrally on the hypothalamic pituitary system by suppressing the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Both continuous progestogens and continuous gestrinone are effective therapies for the treatment of painful symptoms associated with endometriosis. There was no overall evidence of a benefit of one oral progestogen over another. However, this conclusion must be treated with caution due to the lack of placebo-controlled studies [8]. The World Endometriosis Society (WES) [5] and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) [6] guidelines discuss the use of gestrinone as a possible medication for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain. Gestrinone should be used for those whom other treatments have proven ineffective despite potential treatment-associated adverse effects [5]. However, there is still a lack of quality evidence from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.
      GLADE (Gestrinone peLlet AnD Endometriosis) Study is a decentralized, patient-centered, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical study to primarily evaluate the safety and tolerability of subdermal gestrinone bioabsorbable pellet in the treatment of pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis. With this study, we hope to advance the knowledge about gestrinone subdermal pellets, their possible side effects, pharmacokinetics profile and their ability to alleviate pain and improve quality of life of women with endometriosis.
      
        Gestrinone compound profile
        
          Physicochemical properties and pharmaceutical formulation
          3-ethyl-17-hydroxy-18,19-dinor-17α-pregna-4,9,11-trien-20-yn-one, known as gestrinone, ethylnorgestrienone or R-2323 is a synthetic derivative of 19-nortestosterone developed in 1960 originally as a contraceptive and has been studied as a treatment for leiomyoma and endometriosis [9]. It is a compound with the molecular formula C21H24O2 and a molecular weight 308.4.14.
        
        
          Mechanism of action
          The mechanism of action of gestrinone is complex and multimediated. It inhibits folliculogenesis and acts on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, preventing the increase in gonadotropins (FSH and LH) in the middle of the ovulatory cycle, causing estrogen inhibition, anovulation, and amenorrhea. It has an affinity for progesterone and estrogen receptors and a low affinity for androgen receptors while at the same time inducing a reduction in the expression of progesterone receptors [10]. It can reduce the production of SHBG (Sex-hormone binding globulin), which causes an increase in blood levels of free testosterone and progesterone, leading to the emergence of their androgenic effects [11].
        
        
          Metabolization and excretion
          After oral administration, gestrinone has a serum half-life of around 24 h, undergoing active hepatic metabolism essentially by hydroxylation, and its metabolic conjugates are eliminated through urine (40–45%) and feces (30–35%) [12].
        
        
          Side effects
          Most of the adverse effects of gestrinone are due to its androgenic activity and include acne, skin and hair seborrhea, mild hirsutism, edema, weight gain, voice changes, androgenetic alopecia, and clitoral hypertrophy. The drug showed an embryotoxic effect on animals, with a risk of androgenization of female fetuses. It reduces HDL concentrations, and it is recommended to monitor cholesterol and liver transaminase levels in hyperlipidemic patients and glucose levels in diabetic patients. Other effects related to inhibition of the pituitary-ovarian axis may include menstrual disorders and amenorrhea, hot flashes, sweating, breast reduction, changes in libido, vaginal dryness, and emotional fluctuations [13].
        
        
          Clinical evidence
          Previous clinical studies evaluating gestrinone and endometriosis are scarce. A study by Diaz et al. (1977) assessed the contraceptive effect of the subdermal gestrinone implant in Chilean women for 12 months, as well as the emergence of possible adverse events. The authors reported a potent inhibitory effect on fertility in patients, which was accompanied by an increase in transaminases and the appearance of acne, headaches, and hirsutism [14].
          Oral treatment with gestrinone (2.5 to 5 mg twice a week) induced improvement in symptoms associated with endometriosis without the need for daily administration of the drug, which is usually required in similar conservative therapies, representing an option for treatment of the disease. Furthermore, patients treated vaginally tend to have fewer androgenic adverse events such as acne, seborrhea, and weight gain than those treated orally [15].
          Worthington et al. (1993) evaluated the effects of oral gestrinone (1.25 and 2.5 mg twice a week for 6 months) on some metabolic parameters of women with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. The study concluded that the drug was effective in treating the disease without inducing any loss of bone density but caused unfavorable effects on serum lipids and lipoproteins that were reversed 6 months after the end of treatment [16].
          A randomized clinical study involving 43 women with endometriosis compared 6 months of treatment with gestrinone (5 mg per week) or buserelin nasal spray (300 µg every 8 h) with a 5-year follow-up and found that both treatments were effective in remitting endometriosis. There were reports of acne and vascular events such as edema and heaviness in the lower limbs in the group that received gestrinone [17].
          In 1996, The Gestrinone Italian Group Study compared oral treatment with gestrinone and leuprolide acetate for pelvic pain in women with endometriosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical study, concluding that both were equally effective. However, gestrinone did not affect the patient’s bone density despite inducing fluctuations in serum lipid values [18].
          Trials evaluating gestrinone in the form of a gel for vaginal application (Gestrinone Pentravan®) for the treatment of endometriosis have also been carried out and report positive effects of the drug in relieving refractory pain [19].
          Subdermal gestrinone bioabsorbable pellet could be a safe and effective alternative for treating endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and minimize adverse events observed with oral administration.
        
      
      
        Objectives
        
          Primary objective
          To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response.
        
        
          Secondary safety objectives
          To evaluate the potential for androgenization of the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response.
        
        
          Other exploratory objectives
          To compare the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet versus placebo pellet on participant satisfaction, change in pelvic pain intensity, use of pain relief medication, uterine bleeding pattern and quality of life. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of gestrinone will be characterized in a subgroup of participants.
        
      
    
    
      Patients and methods
      The report of this study protocol follow the SPIRIT (standard protocol items: Recommendations for interventional trials) 2013 guidelines [20].
      
        Study design
        The first participant was included on February 25th 2023 and the last patient last visit is estimated for April 2025. The laboratory analysis for measurement of gestrinone plasma levels are undergoing. We will carry a decentralized, patient-centered, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. The study will be conducted in 7 research centers in Brazil (hospital and clinics).
        The study protocol has several innovations to increase participant recruitment and retention such as the organization of disease awareness campaigns and the participation of a patient representative as member of the Trial Steering Committee. Participant representative provided information about the burden of the disease and the impact of the treatment through a patient perspective that enabled the inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in the study protocol. An App will be used to remotely collect diary registries about uterine bleeding pattern and use of analgesics for pain relief and other adverse events in real time. These protocol innovations are depicted in Figure 1.

            Protocol innovations.
          
          
        
        The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB – Comitê de Ética Hospital Leforte, CAAE: 64457622.5.1001.5485, Approval Number: 5.748.523, Dated: November 9th, 2022). The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at all research sites. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before any study procedure is applied. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05570786). The first participant was included on February 25th 2023 and the last patient last visit is estimated for April 2025.
        The study protocol is composed of two stages: 1) Main protocol: randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, N = 100 participants, treatment duration and follow-up: 6 months; 2) Extension-PK (EXT-PK): open-label, N = 15 participants (subgroup of participants who concluded the main protocol and accepted to receive the treatment; follow-up: 6 months. The study design is depicted in Figure 2.

            Study design.
          
          
        
        Participants eligible for the main stage of the study will be randomized into one of the treatment arms:Experimental: Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) and gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet (85 mg)Comparator: Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) Kyleena® levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and subdermal implant of placebo bioabsorbable pellet
        The insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) is necessary as a contraceptive method for all study participants. LNG-IUS (LNG-IUS 12) has been developed for up to 5 years of use with an average release rate of ∼12 μg/24 h over the first year [21]. Clinical assessments will be recorded at recruitment (baseline), 3 and 6 months after pellet insertion. Assessment of the primary outcome will be carried out 6 months after insertion of the gestrinone pellet.
        Participants will be invited to an extension phase (open-label) of the study to provide additional long-term safety data (EXT-PK). A subgroup of 15 participants at the end of 6 months of the main stage of the study who accept to participate in the extension phase will receive an insertion of a gestrinone pellet (85 mg), and the serum concentration of gestrinone will be monitored to characterize its pharmacokinetic profile (PK). Clinical assessments will be recorded at recruitment (baseline), 1, 3 and 6 months after pellet insertion. Blood sampling for PK study will be conducted.
        Bioabsorbable gestrinone pellets are produced and marketed by Biòs Farmacêutica following standardized procedures and current legislation. Pellets containing a placebo will be prepared under the same conditions as those containing the product ingredient. Biòs Farmacêutica will donate all pellets used in this study.
        GLADE is an investigator-initiated project. Biòs Farmacêutica funded the trial but was not involved in the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, writing of the manuscript, or decision to publish. The Trial Steering Committee designed the study protocol and is monitoring the trial’s progress. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first and the last author and revised based on comments from all the authors. No writing assistance was provided.
      
      
        Patients
        The study will enroll 100 women with refractory pain control who underwent surgery for endometriosis at least 3 months ago and who had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of deep infiltrative endometriosis. Eligible participants are women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis surgically treated with refractory symptoms, independent of pain intensity. .Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain includes dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain.
        Study participants have a medical history of indication for surgery as an option to reduce endometriosis associated-pain after having been failed to standard hormone treatment (combined hormonal contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists or GnRH antagonists). Surgeries were conducted to fully eliminate endometriotic lesions from both the posterior compartment and anterior compartment, as well as from bowel compartment whenever present.

      Study endpoints
      
        Primary safety outcome
        It is a combination of serious adverse events (SAEs) accumulated within 6 months of insertion of the gestrinone or placebo pellet and collected through spontaneous reports and clinical findings. The primary safety outcome will be the percentage of patients who do NOT experience SAEs 6 months after randomization.
        SAEs are unfavorable medical events that result in any of the following outcomes:DeathThreat or risk to lifeNeed for hospitalizationProlongation of pre-existing hospitalizationPermanent disability or damageCongenital anomaly; orSignificant medical occurrences that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may harm the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the other occurrences mentioned. In this study, the occurrence of thromboembolic events (such as, for example, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack) was pre-defined as a significant medical occurrence.
      
      
        Secondary safety outcomes [timepoints: pre-pellet insertion assessment, 3 and 6 months after gestrinone or placebo pellet insertion]
        The main secondary safety outcome will be defined as the number of participants who experience androgenization defined by:Hirsutism: defined by Ferriman-Gallwey Score ≥ 8Clitoromegaly: defined by Clitoral index ≥ 35 mm2Acne: defined by the IGA scale (Investigator’s global assessment) grade 5 – severe inflammatory acne dominates the area, and there are many comedones, pustules, papules, and cystic acneAlopecia with sequelae of scalp thinningDeepening of the voice

        Other exploratory outcomes
        The pharmacokinetic profile of gestrinone will be characterized in a subgroup of participants (N = 15). The pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined: area under the curve (AUC(0-∞)), maximum concentration (Cmax), time until reaching maximum concentration (Tmax), and half-life (t1/2).
      
      
        Assessment of outcomes measures
        Outcomes measures will be assessed during each of the three study visits in the main study protocol (randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled stage), including a baseline visit (pre-treatment), a 3-month visit and 6-month visit. A trained team, including a gynecologist, will conduct the study in the outpatient setting in all study centers. Clinical assessments, monitoring of adverse events, evaluation of androgenization (hirsutism, clitoral index, acne, alopecia, and deepening of the voice), as well as pelvic pain intensity and quality of life assessed by SF-36 questionnaire will be evaluated at all the three study visits. Laboratory blood assessment will be conducted at the baseline visit and in the 3-month visit and include: complete blood count, liver and kidney function (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, urea, creatinine, and uric acid), lipid profile (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL) and blood glucose, coagulogram (PT and aPTT), and plasma hormone levels (total testosterone, free testosterone, and SHBG). Quality of life assessment by the EHP-30 questionnaire will be applied at the baseline visit and in the 3-month visit. Data on uterine bleeding pattern and use of medication to relieve pelvic pain will be remotely collected using and electronic diary available at the App used in the study protocol.
        Outcomes measures in the EXT-PK (open-label) will be assessed during each of the four study visits in which clinical evaluation, monitoring of adverse events, evaluation of androgenization, pelvic pain intensity and quality of life by SF-36 questionnaire will be conducted in each of the clinical visits, including baseline (pre-treatment), 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month after the insertion of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet. Blood sampling for PK study will be conducted: pre-insertion of the gestrinone pellet (predose); different times after insertion of the gestrinone pellet: +24h; 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168 days. Data on uterine bleeding pattern and use of medication to relieve pelvic pain will be remotely collected using an electronic diary established to be available at the App established to be used in the study protocol.
      
      
        Study procedures
        Participant-reported outcomes will be collected via the App used in the study protocol: Quality of Life 36-item Form Health Survey (SF-36); endometriosis health profile – Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30); diary to record the use of analgesics for pelvic pain and uterine bleeding pattern. On the first visit, access to the App will be provided to the participant; the participant will receive guidance on how to use the App, and baseline data will be collected. Following the study procedure schedule, participants will receive reminders through the App to record outcomes, and telephone contact will be made for those who do not complete the form regularly. At follow-up visits, participants will be retrained if they present difficulties in using it.
      
    
    
      Screening procedures
      
        Gynecological assessment
        A gynecological assessment will be carried out to check the conditions of the female reproductive tract and the suitability for the insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12). Furthermore, menstrual history, hormone use, pregnancy, and fertility history will be collected. A transvaginal ultrasound will be performed to assess the positioning of the device.
      
      
        Treatments
        
          Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12)
          The LNG-IUS 12 (Kyleena®) must be inserted in an outpatient setting by the investigator following the manufacturer instructions. After carrying out a gynecological examination to check the size and position of the uterus, the cervix should be visualized with the aid of a speculum, and the cervix and the vagina should be cleaned with an antiseptic solution. With the help of the sliding guide, the IUS inserter must be pushed to the bottom of the uterus to position the device.
        
        
          Insertion of the investigational product or subdermal bioabsorbable placebo pellet
          The investigator will conduct the procedure in an outpatient setting. After local anesthesia, a small incision (4–5 mm) will be made, through which the pellet will be inserted under the skin of the buttock using a trocar. It will be performed just after the insertion of the LNG-IUS 12, and the randomization procedure.
        
      
      
        Safety and efficacy endpoint assessments
        Suspected events and outcomes must be analyzed by the Clinical Events Classification Committee. Safety results should be indicated on the eCRF clinical status page and should be submitted for review.
      
      
        Laboratory evaluation
        Blood samples (total volume of 10 mL) will be collected through venipuncture from the participant in the following tubes: tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant to perform the blood count, tubes with separating gel (to evaluate biochemical parameters of liver and kidney function, hormonal and lipid profile) or citrate (to perform a coagulogram), observing a prior 8-hour fast. After separating the serum, dosages will be carried out using commercially available kits following the instructions specified by the manufacturer. The local laboratory will conduct the analyses using its protocols and equipment and following Biosafety Standards and Good Laboratory Practices.
      
    
    
      Assessment of androgenization
      
        Hirsutism
        The investigator will assess the degree of hirsutism. The participant should be instructed to suspend hair removal/waxing for approximately 14 days before each visit. The use of lasers for hair removal will not be permitted during the entire study period. To evaluate and quantify hirsutism, the modified Ferriman-Gallwey Scoring System will be used, which includes 9 body regions (excluding the legs and armpits) for access to hair growth, grading from 0 (no terminal hair growth) to 4 (extensive hair growth) in 9 locations. The total score ranges from 0 to 36, with a score greater than 8 considered a sign of androgen excess in Caucasian women. A score of 8 – 15 indicates mild hirsutism; above 15, moderate to severe hirsutism. For other ethnic groups, the amount of hair expected for each specific ethnicity must be considered [22].
      
      
        Clitoris measurement
        The investigator will measure the participant’s clitoris (portion corresponding to the glans) [23]. The size of the clitoris will be measured using a 15 cm plastic ruler. The Clitoridean Index will be considered as the product of the longitudinal diameter (in millimeters) x transverse diameter (in millimeters), considering clitoromegaly when these measurements are more significant than 6.5 and 4.4 respectively, and the Clitoridean Index greater than 35 mm2 [24]. Additionally, the participant’s clitoris corresponding to the part of glans + corpus will be measured and registered.
      
      
        Deepening of the voice
        A speech therapist will evaluate the participant’s vocal pattern using protocols and equipment validated by evaluating professionals. The participant’s voice will be recorded using a digital recorder for evaluation. The pattern observed on each visit will always be compared with that recorded during the initial visit (Basal) to detect possible vocal changes and, more specifically, the deepening of the voice.
      
      
        Assessment of the degree of acne
        The severity of acne will be assessed
        By using the IGA scale (Investigator’s global assessment) to be used by the trained researcher and described below:0 – Clear skin: no evidence of acne1 – Almost clear skin: some inflammatory lesions and some non-inflamed papules present (developing papules, without redness yet)2 – Moderately severe acne: some non-inflammatory lesions dominate the area with some pustules and papules (there are no cystic lesions)3 – Non-inflammatory acne dominates the area, and some inflammatory lesions can be found. There may or may not be a small cystic lesion in the area,4 – Inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions are more visible. There may or may not be some cystic acne lesions.5 – Severe inflammatory acne dominates the area. Many comedones, pustules, papules, and cystic acne will be present.
      
    
    
      Alopecia
      The investigator will assess the occurrence of alopecia according to the presence of rarefaction sequelae on the scalp.
      
        Uterine bleeding or bleeding-free days
        The participant must record in the electronic diary (App) whether there has been uterine bleeding in the last 24 h. If the answer is positive, she must inform us of the intensity of the bleeding (whether spotting or bleeding). Based on the data documented in the participant’s diary, the following parameters will be evaluated:Total number of days of amenorrheaTotal number of bleeding-free days in the reference periodTotal number of days of bleeding and spotting (escape)Total number of days with bleeding or spotting in the reference periodNumber of consecutive bleeding-free daysNumber of consecutive days without bleeding after starting treatmentTotal number of days with spotting (escape)Total number of days with spotting (escape) in the reference periodTotal number of days to cessation of bleeding after starting treatment
        The bleeding pattern will be classified according to the criteria of Belsey [25] described below: normal bleeding − 3 to 5 episodes of spotting or bleeding within 90 days; prolonged bleeding – more than 14 days of continuous spotting or bleeding within 90 days; frequent bleeding – more than 14 days of constant spotting or bleeding within 90 days; infrequent bleeding – less than 3 episodes of spotting or bleeding within 90 days; amenorrhea – no bleeding during the 90 days of the reference period.
      
      
        Assessment of changes in the intensity of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea based on the Visual Analogue scale (VAS/EVA)
        The study participants will receive a diagram based on the Visual Analogue Scale shown below to assess chronic non-cyclical pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. The VAS scale is standardized from 0 (no pain) to 10 (in centimeters) (the worst pain imaginable).
      
      
        Record of pre-study and concomitant medications
        At the screening visit, pre-study medication use will be recorded. The participant must record in the electronic diary through the App used in the study about the use of concomitant medications, especially for pain relief (analgesics).
      
      
        Assessment of patient-reported quality of life
        The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Form Health Survey (SF-36) measured health-related quality of life. Participants must respond to the SF-36 questionnaire. The SF-36 is a multidimensional questionnaire containing 36 items distributed into 8 components: functional capacity, physical aspects, pain, general health status, vitality, social and emotional aspects, and mental health. It has a final score that ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to the worst general health status and 100 to the best health status [26].
      
    
    
      Endometriosis health profile 30 (EHP-30)
      Participants must respond to the EHP-30 questionnaire. The EHP-30 is a self-report instrument that measures how endometriosis affects a woman’s health status and quality of life. It consists of a central questionnaire composed of 30 items that access 5 dimensions: pain, control and helplessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image; and a modular questionnaire with 23 items distributed across 6 scales: sexual relations, work, medical profession, infertility, relationship with children and treatment. Each scale is transformed into a score from 0 to 100, with the lowest score meaning a better quality of life [27].
      
        Patient satisfaction with treatment
        Participants must rate their satisfaction with the treatment by choosing one of the following alternatives presented in written form (ranging from 1 to 5): very satisfied, satisfied, not sure, dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied.
      
      
        Pharmacokinetic profile of gestrinone
        Blood sampling will be conducted at pre-insertion of the gestrinone pellet; different times after insertion of the gestrinone pellet: +24h; 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168 days
        A sensitive and specific high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated by a local specialized laboratory for the determination of gestrinone in human serum using nomegestrol acetate-d5 as an internal standard. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.05 ng/mL.
        The pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated: area under the curve (AUC(0-∞)), maximum concentration (Cmax), time until reaching maximum concentration (Tmax), and half-life (t1/2).
      
      
        Reports of pregnancy
        Participants should be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they become pregnant during the study. The investigator must report any pregnancy in study participants that occurs within 30 days of the last administration of the investigational product.
      
      
        Randomization and allocation concealment
        Participants will be randomized into one of the study arms in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with gestrinone or placebo, stratified by center. According to an electronically predefined randomization list, participants will be assigned to a treatment group (RedCap, version 11.0.3). Participants are randomly allocated to one of the study arms, and neither the investigator nor the study participants influence the allocation of participants to the groups (blinding).
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Statistical analysis will be carried out by researchers independently. Summaries by treatment group will be provided using appropriate descriptive statistics for all study variables. Descriptive statistics such as mean ± standard deviation median (minimum-maximum) will summarize continuous variables. Categorical variables will be summarized as the proportions of each category. Graphical data presentation can also be used to summarize data. The values of the scores and indices will be compared with the baseline values (baseline = pre-treatment) using the paired t-test and Wilcoxon test. Changes in laboratory measurements and other secondary outcomes will be compared with the paired Wilcoxon test. Unless otherwise indicated, all statistical tests will be interpreted at a nominal (i.e. no multiplicity adjustment) two-tailed significance level of 0.05 and all CIs at a nominal two-tailed 95% level. The safety and exploratory efficacy outcomes results will be used for analyses.
        The Intention-To-Treat (ITT) and Per Protocol (PP) population will assess all safety and exploratory efficacy endpoints. The ITT population consists of all randomized participants who received the subdermal implant. The PP population includes only participants who complete all research procedures and do not present significant protocol violations, including breach of inclusion criteria.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      Pelvic pain is of multifactorial origin, in which endometriosis is the leading cause. It is challenging to treat endometriosis and there are surgical and hormonal treatments available with variable endpoints. Post-surgery recurrence rate of painful symptoms is high and alternative hormonal methods are needed. Gestrinone is one of the clinical options to reduce endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, but data from clinical controlled trials, particularly with subcutaneous pellets, are scarce.
      This will be the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the safety of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet versus placebo in women with endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response. This is the first to thoroughly evaluate the possible benefits of such a novel gestrinone pharmaceutical formulation with low-dose levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12) and might improve clinical outcomes in this population.
      The study protocol has several innovations such as the participation of a patient representative as member of the Trial Steering Committee. Participant representative provided information about the burden of the disease and the impact of the treatment through a patient perspective that enabled the inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in the study protocol. The trial will use advanced technology for data collection to capture participant′s responses, as well as clinical and biological data. In addition, the study includes a variety of biochemical analyses, including an extension phase that will provide crucial information on the long-term use of gestrinone pellets and PK analyses by LC-MS/MS.
      Since it is a safety-focused study, the trial has an experienced and independent Data Safety Monitoring Board and Clinical Events Classification Committee to evaluate all possible events blindly.
      We acknowledge some limitations of the study. Given the possible 10% dropout rate, the sample size might be small. However, given that it is a safety-focused phase II study, results might serve as a basis for large clinical trials powered enough to conclude the safety and efficacy of gestrinone pellets in patients with pelvic pain due to endometriosis. Another limitation of the GLADE trial was not excluding concomitant adenomyosis at screening. There is a need for future studies to evaluate the efficacy of gestrinone with more precise endometriosis phenotype including concomitant adenomyosis.
      In addition, the target population of GLADE trial is women with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain refractory to surgical treatment, independent of the surgical approach. The potential heterogeneity concerning surgical approaches, preferences and techniques performed at multiple Brazilian centers of expertise in endometriosis will be equilibrated between treatment groups by electronic randomization. Further larger studies addressing the efficacy of subdermal pellet of gestrinone and the potential differences of this effect on anterior, posterior or bowel compartment as well as on adenomyosis would bring evidence of a therapeutic option for pelvic pain.
    
    
      Conclusion
      Gestrinone is used for the treatment of pain in women with endometriosis. Still, there is a lack of data from well-designed randomized clinical trials evaluating such a strategy using a subdermal pellet with a particular focus on safety. We expect the current study will provide high-quality evidence of therapeutic efficacy and foster future studies to further characterize subdermal pellets of gestrinone as a therapeutic option for endometriosis-related pelvic pain.

Title: Dysprosium, cerium, indium, yttrium, and lutetium as emerging contributors to oxidative stress in polycystic ovary syndrome

Abstract: To investigate the role of Dysprosium (Dy), Cerium (Ce), Indium (In), Yttrium (Y), and Lutetium (Lu) in relation to oxidative stress (OS) and their potential alterations in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) females. This case-control study included two groups: Healthy controls (50) and PCOS cases (56). Serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu were quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). OS was evaluated by measuring serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation was performed to investigate the correlation between rare earth elements (REEs) and OS markers and differences in correlation strength between the PCOS and control groups were assessed using Fisher’s z-test. PCOS subjects exhibited markedly higher concentrations of Dy, Ce, In, and Y than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The analysis of OS biomarkers revealed elevated MDA levels in the PCOS group, indicating enhanced lipid peroxidation, alongside significantly reduced antioxidant capacity (GSH and SOD) (P < 0.001). Pearson’s correlation demonstrated significant positive associations between higher Dy, Ce, and Y levels and increased MDA levels (P < 0.05). Additionally, a significant negative correlation was observed between In and Y and the antioxidant markers GSH and SOD (P < 0.05), with Ce also showing an inverse association with SOD (P < 0.05). Fisher’s z-test further confirmed significant differences in correlation strength between the PCOS and control groups for Dy-MDA (z = 2.01, P = 0.031), Ce-MDA (z = 1.78, P = 0.037), In-GSH (z = − 2.24, P = 0.025), and In-SOD (z = − 2.39, P = 0.017). Moreover, significant correlations were found between Dy and Y (r = 0.41, P = 0.003), Ce and In (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), Ce and Y (r = 0.53, P < 0.001), and In and Y (r = 0.70, P < 0.001), suggesting interconnected roles of Dy, Ce, In, and Y in PCOS. These findings point to a potential link between OS and REE exposure in the development of PCOS. They suggest that metal-induced oxidative damage could be a key contributor to its pathophysiology. The study underscores the need for deeper investigation into environmental factors affecting reproductive health and for identifying strategies to mitigate these risks in women with PCOS.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-10468-2.

Body: Introduction
      With the surge in technological and industrial progress, women’s health faces unprecedented challenges. The extensive use of metallic compounds in agriculture and domestic spheres has intensified exposure to various elements, raising significant concerns about their impact, especially on reproductive health. Rare earth elements (REEs), often known as ‘technology elements,’ are vital to the advancement of numerous high-tech fields, including consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones and computers) and sustainable energy technologies1–3. Although their distinctive chemical characteristics render them critical for such applications, growing environmental accumulation of REEs has raised concerns regarding their potential effects on human health, particularly in relation to reproductive disorders like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Environmentally, growing extraction, use, and disposal of these elements have led to their accumulation, with human activities contributing to their buildup in soil and water systems4–7. Human exposure to REEs is elevated due to their high mobility and ion-emitting properties, which allow them to easily enter ecosystems, accumulate in the food chain, and increase environmental exposure. As “emerging pollutants,” these elements remain largely unregulated, with limited monitoring and insufficient understanding of their toxic effects. Concerns about the health impacts of REEs are growing, particularly regarding their effects on reproductive health, including fertility and pregnancy outcomes8–11. Although studies on its reproductive toxicity are limited, evidence from animal models indicates that elevated doses may disrupt ovarian function and lead to embryotoxic effects. The adverse effects of REEs on reproductive function have been investigated in sea urchins, where exposure was shown to impair fertilization, disrupt redox balance, interfere with embryonic development, and alter the regulation of genes involved in embryogenesis12. Notably, some human studies have documented an increased risk of preeclampsia, neural tube defects, adverse IVF outcomes, spontaneous abortion, and premature membrane rupture with higher maternal REE levels13–16. More recently, an increased risk of pregnancy loss has been reported in women with miscarriage owing to increase in serum REE9–11. Metals like Dysprosium (Dy), Cerium (Ce), Indium (In), and yttrium (Y) and Lutetium (Lu), may pose a significant risk to reproductive health, due to their widespread use in modern technologies and potential toxicity1,17–19. A recent case–control study reported higher heavy metals in women with PCOS compared to controls, linking these alterations to metabolic dysfunction and environmental exposures19.
      PCOS is a complex endocrine disorder and a major cause of infertility in women globally17. The condition presents with irregular ovulation, excess androgens, and polycystic ovaries, though its underlying causes remain poorly understood20–22. While the etiology of PCOS is multifactorial, recent evidence suggests that environmental factors, including exposure to heavy metals and REEs, may contribute to its development23–25, however, underlying etiologies remain unclear. Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu are REEs that may have potential impacts on reproductive health. Presumably, they could induce oxidative stress (OS), and alter redox balance, potentially exacerbating conditions associated with PCOS13,26–28. Increased levels of these REEs can interfere with hormonal balance, affect ovarian function, and impair fertility. Oxidative damage resulting from REE exposure may alter reproductive processes like oocyte maturation and impair follicle development in the case of PCOS. While the full extent of their impact on human reproductive health remains under investigation, emerging research suggests that exposure to these REEs may contribute to reproductive toxicity and conditions such as infertility and PCOS. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to examine serum levels of selected rare earth elements - Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu in patients with PCOS. It seeks to explore the correlation between these elements and markers of OS, comparing PCOS patients with fertile controls. The reprotoxic effects of these five REEs are scarcely documented in pregnancy-related research involving humans, making them the subject of our study. By shedding light on these relationships, this research aims to provide new insights into how REEs may contribute to the development and progression of PCOS. The findings could have far-reaching implications for developing diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies, offering a deeper understanding of how environmental pollutants influence reproductive health and paving the way for targeted interventions. The study thus aims to estimate the serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu in women with PCOS and to assess the correlation between these REE levels and oxidative stress markers in PCOS patients compared to fertile controls.
    
    
      Result
      
        Participant characteristics
        This study revealed notable differences between women with PCOS and controls across clinical, and biochemical parameters. Among the participants, 52.8% were women with PCOS, while 47.1% served as controls. Sociodemographic characteristics showed no statistically significant variation across the study groups, as demonstrated by data from our prior study29. However, clinical features such as irregular menses (56%) and acne (60%) were significantly more prevalent among women with PCOS (P < 0.01).
      
      
        Biochemical profile and OS markers
        Biochemical assessments showed that fasting blood sugar (FBS) and HbA1c levels were markedly higher in the PCOS group than in controls (P < 0.001). Similarly, PCOS group exhibited significantly higher luteinizing hormone (LH) levels accompanied by increased triglyceride (TG) concentrations at P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 respectively (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). PCOS group exhibited a notable increase in MDA levels, a marker of lipid peroxidation, compared to controls (P < 0.001). Conversely, antioxidant markers such as GSH and SOD were significantly reduced in women with PCOS (P < 0.001).
      
      
         Rare Earth element levels
        REE levels differed significantly across the groups analyzed. Serum levels of Dy, was significantly higher in the PCOS group than in controls (P < 0.001), along with elevated levels of Ce, In, and Y, which were significant at P < 0.05. However, the levels of Lu remain insignificant between the two groups (Table 1).
      
      
        Correlation analysis between REEs and OS markers
        To assess the link between elevated REE levels and OS markers, Pearson’s correlation analysis was carried out (Table 2). In the control group, no significant associations were detected between REEs and OS markers. However, distinct patterns emerged in the PCOS group: (a) for MDA, positive correlations were observed with Dy (r = 0.29, p = 0.04), Ce (r = 0.30, P = 0.03), and Y (r = 0.33, P = 0.02) in PCOS subjects, while correlations in controls were weaker and nonsignificant. Fisher’s z-test indicated significant differences between groups for Dy (z = 2.01, P = 0.031), Ce (z = 1.78, P = 0.037), and Y (z = 1.90, P = 0.049) and (b) antioxidant Status: In and Y exhibited negative correlations with antioxidant markers-GSH and SOD (P < 0.05). GSH correlated negatively with In (r = − 0.30, P = 0.034), with a significant between-group difference (z = − 2.24, P = 0.025). SOD showed significant negative correlations with Ce (r = − 0.33, P = 0.02) and In (r = − 0.31, p = 0.02), with Fisher’s z-tests confirming significant between-group differences (z = − 1.90, P = 0.049; z = − 2.39, P = 0.017, respectively). These findings suggest altered associations between REEs and OS markers in PCOS compared to controls. In multiple testing correction, the raw P-values for markers (MDA, SOD, GSH, Dy) ranged from 0.000013 to 0.00042, indicating significant differences between PCOS cases and controls. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, markers with P-values < 0.00013 remained statistically significant. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction/False Discovery Rate (FDR) identified additional significant markers with P-values up to 0.045 (Supplementary Table 3). MDA and Dy remained significant after both Bonferroni and FDR corrections, showing strong associations. SOD and GSH were significant after FDR but only partially after Bonferroni correction. Lu was not significant by either method. Ce, In, and Y were significant only after FDR correction. This indicates that FDR correction might be better suited for detecting relevant findings in this exploratory study. The correlations that remain significant after multiple testing correction—especially after FDR adjustment can be considered statistically meaningful within the exploratory context of the study. Correlation plots for these relationships in PCOS cases are provided in Figs. 1, 2 and 3.

        Inter-Element relationships
        Table 3 displays the inter-element correlation analysis of REEs in the PCOS group. Y exhibited strong significant positive correlations with Ce (r = 0.53, P < 0.001), and In (r = 0.70, P < 0.001). Additionally, Y demonstrated a moderate positive correlation with Dy (r = 0.41, P = 0.003). Further, a strong positive correlation was observed between In and Ce (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), suggesting a notable relationship between these elements. Lu showed no significant correlations with other elements in the study, indicating weaker relationships in comparison to other pairs. In summary, significant positive correlations were primarily observed between Yttrium (Y), Indium (In), and Cerium (Ce), while the other element combinations showed weak or no significant relationships.

      Discussion
      The findings of this study uncover a critical link between REEs and PCOS, highlighting their potential role in disrupting redox balance and contributing to OS. Women with PCOS exhibited significantly elevated serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, and Y compared to healthy controls, alongside reduced antioxidant defenses and a shift toward oxidative dominance. These results emphasize the impact of environmental exposure to REEs on reproductive health and suggest OS-induced metal toxicity as a key factor in the pathophysiology of PCOS.
      This study provides a new perspective on the environmental and biochemical influences underlying PCOS. REEs, commonly used in various industrial applications have garnered attention for their potential health impacts. However, the toxicity and biological effects of REEs on human reproductive health have been poorly studied, particularly in conditions such as PCOS. This study suggests that environmental exposure to REEs may exacerbate OS, contributing to the reproductive challenges observed in PCOS. Among the REE-Lutetium (Lu), dysprosium (Dy), cerium (Ce), indium (In), and yttrium (Y) play essential roles in modern technologies. Lutetium is primarily used in high-performance catalysts for petroleum refining and nuclear medicine for cancer treatment30. Dysprosium is crucial in the production of high-performance permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and electronics, and also finds applications in lasers and nuclear reactors31. Cerium, being the most abundant REE, is used in catalytic converters for automobiles to reduce emissions, in glass polishing, and the manufacturing of batteries and fuel cells32. Indium, typically extracted from zinc ores, is widely used in the production of thin-film photovoltaic cells, LCDs, and semiconductors, as well as in solders and alloys33. Yttrium, though relatively abundant among REEs, is essential in producing phosphors for displays, superconductors, lasers, and cancer treatments. These elements are extracted from minerals like bastnasite and monazite and have become critical components in technologies such as electronics, renewable energy systems, and environmental applications34. The growing use of REEs has resulted in their accumulation in soil and water, raising concerns about environmental and health risks, particularly regarding their effects on reproduction and pregnancy35,36. High doses of In have been shown to impair ovarian function and exhibit embryotoxic effects in animal studies37. Yttrium has also been reported to accumulate in reproductive tissues, which may interfere with normal reproductive processes; however, its human health impact remains uncertain38. Elevated serum REE levels have also been linked to adverse reproductive outcomes, including poor in vitro fertilization success, spontaneous abortion, and premature membrane rupture39. These effects highlight the distinct cytotoxic profiles of individual REEs across species and underscore the variability in their toxicological impacts.
      This study expands on previous research by examining REEs in women with PCOS and their potential links to OS. Notably, serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, and Y were significantly elevated in the PCOS cases relative to controls at P < 0.05. These elevated REE levels were positively associated with increased lipid peroxidation, as indicated by higher MDA levels (P < 0.05), and negatively correlated with reduced antioxidant markers, including SOD and GSH (P < 0.05). The findings of the current study are consistent with previous studies22,40,41. Significant positive correlations between REEs (Dy, Ce, Y) and MDA, along with negative correlations with antioxidants (GSH, SOD), were observed only in PCOS patients. These associations differed significantly from controls, indicating that REEs may specifically contribute to OS in PCOS. This highlights a potential role of REE exposure in the disease’s oxidative pathophysiology. The significant correlations between REEs in the PCOS group: Dy and Y (r = 0.41, P = 0.003), Ce and In (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), Ce and Y (r = 0.53, P = 0.0006), and In and Y (r = 0.70, P = 0.0001, further suggests interconnected roles of Dy, Ce, In, and Y in PCOS. Our findings demonstrate significant alterations in OS markers in PCOS cases compared to controls. The use of multiple testing corrections ensured that the reported associations are unlikely to be false positives. The Bonferroni correction, while conservative, confirmed the strongest associations (MDA, Dy), whereas the Benjamini-Hochberg method allowed for the detection of additional markers (Ce, In, Y) that may be biologically relevant. Overall, correcting for multiple testing ensured the reliability of the findings, with both conservative and liberal approaches highlighting key differences in oxidative and elemental profiles of PCOS patients versus controls.
      Despite decades of research, the precise pathogenesis of PCOS remains elusive. While its underlying causes are still being investigated, emerging evidence highlights OS as a critical factor in its development. The augmented OS in PCOS can be traced back to several sources. This study postulates that exposure to REEs such as Dy, Ce, In, and Y may contribute to the onset or progression of PCOS through OS-mediated mechanisms. REEs are known to induce OS by disrupting the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant defense systems42. Elevated OS has been documented in the follicular fluid and serum of women with PCOS, highlighting their significant contribution to the pathophysiology of the condition23. Among these biomarkers, malondialdehyde (MDA), a stable end-product of lipid peroxidation has proven to be a reliable indicator of oxidative damage. Studies have reported a 47% increase in circulating MDA levels in women with PCOS compared to controls, underscoring the role of lipid peroxidation in the metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions characteristic of the disorder43,44.
      Cells defend against free radical damage using antioxidant systems, including enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. Of prime importance, Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a key enzyme that neutralizes ROS by converting superoxide anions (O₂⁻) into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). There is conflicting evidence regarding SOD levels in PCOS, with some studies reporting elevated levels, while others have found decreased activity in serum and follicular fluid45,46. Increased SOD activity protects against OS-induced damage, while decreased activity can lead to apoptosis and corpus luteum regression41. These interactions emphasize the importance of SOD in ovarian function and reproductive health. Imbalances between antioxidants and ROS in follicular fluid can impair oocyte quality, potentially causing abnormal ovulation and infertility, as observed in PCOS patients42. Another key molecule in defending against OS is Glutathione (GSH), a major non-enzymatic antioxidant crucial for neutralizing oxidants and maintaining cellular redox balance. In PCOS, GSH depletion is likely due to elevated oxidants47,48. Presumably, heavy metals exacerbate this depletion by binding to GSH’s sulfhydryl (-SH) groups, forming organo-metallic complexes that disrupt their antioxidant function and further impair cellular defense mechanisms49,50. The OS in PCOS cases observed in the current study aligns with previous evidences. REE exposure in sea urchins led to a marked increase in OS, along with impaired fertilization outcomes and increased developmental defects in offspring as reviewed by Martino et al..,202212. Likewise, studies on algae, including common cyanobacteria, have revealed that Yttrium exposure impairs the antioxidant defense system, leading to increased OS51. More recently, elevated levels of similar elements and impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms in PCOS patients have also been reported18,19,50. Together, these studies highlight the role of REEs in amplifying OS, potentially influencing reproductive health outcomes like those observed in PCOS.
      As reported in previous studies, elevated OS significantly compromises oocyte quality by inducing lipid peroxidation, which impairs maturation and increases the prevalence of immature oocyte25. Moreover, OS disrupts granulosa cell function, which is critical for follicular growth and steroid hormone production, resulting in anovulation, a hallmark of infertility in PCOS43. These disruptions not only impair follicle maturation but also alter the endometrial environment, further intensifying reproductive challenges in women with PCOS. In summary, REEs may worsen PCOS by triggering OS, disturbing endocrine function, and hindering follicle development, all of which contribute to the onset or exacerbation of the condition. To better understand the mechanistic role of REEs in PCOS pathophysiology, future studies should focus on both in vitro and in vivo models. Cellular experiments using ovarian granulosa cells or theca cells could investigate how exposure to elevated REEs affects oxidative stress pathways, mitochondrial function, and steroidogenesis, key processes altered in PCOS. Assessing changes in ROS generation, antioxidant enzyme activity, and expression of genes regulating inflammation and hormone synthesis would clarify direct cellular effects. Animal models of PCOS could be used to evaluate systemic impacts of REE exposure on reproductive and metabolic phenotypes, including hormonal profiles, follicular development, and insulin resistance. Additionally, exploring potential REE-induced epigenetic modifications might uncover long-term regulatory changes contributing to PCOS progression. Human studies incorporating longitudinal designs could assess whether environmental or dietary REE exposure correlates with PCOS onset or severity. Integrating multi-omics approaches, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, may reveal downstream molecular networks perturbed by REEs. Together, these approaches would provide comprehensive insight into how REEs influence PCOS development and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
    
    
      Conclusion
      This study highlights the potential role of REE-induced oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of PCOS. The observed trends point to the need for greater awareness of environmental pollutants in reproductive health. These preliminary findings open new avenues for exploring environmental contributors to PCOS and underscore oxidative stress as a potential therapeutic target.
      
        Limitations of the study:
        While this study is among the first to assess associations between REEs and oxidative stress in PCOS, it did not account for environmental or lifestyle confounders (e.g., diet, pollution, occupational or cosmetic exposure) that may influence REE levels and oxidative stress. The Bonferroni correction, while conservative, confirmed the strongest associations (MDA, Dy), whereas the FDR method allowed the detection of additional markers (Ce, In, Y) that may be biologically relevant but require validation. Future studies should explore the clinical implications of these markers and validate the borderline findings.
      
    
    
      Method
      
        Study design and participants
        This case-controlled study involved women aged 19 to 35 years, divided into two groups: Group I, comprising 50 healthy controls, and Group II, consisting of 56 women diagnosed with PCOS. The study recruited participants from the Section of Obstetrics and Gynecology at King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, located in Riyadh. Ethical clearance was granted by the hospital’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), under approval number E-18-3536. All procedures followed the ethical standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to participation, each individual provided written informed consent.
      
      
        Inclusion and exclusion criteria
        
          PCOS Group:
          Women who met at least two of the following criteria were included in the PCOS group: (a) hyperandrogenism, (b) polycystic ovarian morphology, or (c) experiencing oligo- or amenorrhea, characterized by less than 8 menstrual cycles within a 12-month period. These cases were screened based on the Rotterdam criteria52.
        
        
          Control group:
          Healthy females without any symptoms of hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, infertility, or ultrasound findings suggestive of PCOS.
        
        
          Exclusion criteria:
          Patients on lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications, pregnant women, and those with diabetes, anemia, cancer, infections, thromboembolism, stroke, or ischemic heart disease were excluded.
        
      
      
        Sample collection and baseline characteristics
        Approximately 5 mL of blood was collected from each participant after obtaining written informed consent. The blood was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm to isolate the serum, which was then stored at −80 °C until further analysis to preserve its integrity. Baseline characteristics were assessed using an autoanalyzer, with the Mediserv 3700/Cell Dyne (STA Compact) and Roche Elecsys 2010 (Modular Analytics E170-Cobas e 411) for relevant tests.
      
      
        Detection of oxidative stress
        
          Lipid peroxidation (Malondialdehyde- MDA assay):
          MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were quantified using the MDA Assay Kit (ab118970; Abcam). A standard curve was created with MDA concentrations ranging from 4 to 20 nmol/well or 20–100 µM. The assay measures the formation of MDA-TBA adducts at 532 nm, with a sensitivity of > 0.1 nmol/well. MDA levels were reported in nmol/ml.
        
        
          Antioxidant markers (GSH and SOD):
          Glutathione (GSH) levels and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity were assessed using the Glutathione Assay Kit (CS0260; Sigma) and the SOD Assay Kit- Water-Soluble Tetrazolium salt; WST (19160; Sigma), respectively. In the GSH assay, the formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB), resulting from the reduction of 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), is monitored by measuring its absorbance at 412 nm, with GSH levels expressed in mg/ml. For SOD activity, absorbance at 450 nm was measured after incubating the samples with Water-Soluble Tetrazolium salt (WST) and enzyme working solutions at 37 °C for 20 min. SOD activity was reported in IU/ml.
        
      
      
        Quantification of REE
        Once thawed, serum samples were centrifuged to remove cells, resulting in clear serum. A volume of one milliliter of sera was diluted with a solution of 0.5% nitric acid and 0.01% Triton X-100 to ensure the elements remained dissolved and stable. Subsequently, levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu were measured using the Perkin Elmer NexION 2000G ICP-MS. Certified reference materials (CRMs) with a concentration of 1000 ppm were employed for calibration, and serum metal levels were quantified in parts per billion (ppb). A calibration curve was established with working standards covering 0.025 to 100 ppb. Each standard concentration was measured three times, and a multi-point linear regression was used to correlate signal intensity with concentration. To enhance measurement accuracy and reduce matrix effects, a constant amount of germanium (Ge) was added as an internal standard to all serum samples. The resulting calibration curve exhibited excellent linearity, with a coefficient of determination (R²) exceeding 0.999. LOD values for each element were calculated by assessing the distinction between blank sample signals and background interference, with detection limits as low as 0.025 ppb, reflecting the high sensitivity of the ICP-MS instrument. The method demonstrated strong reliability, with measurement accuracy ranging from 0.3 to 22.8% and precision between 0.8% and 11.8%.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Data analysis was conducted using Sigma Plot version 12. About 56 PCOS cases and 50 healthy controls were initially recruited; statistical analyses were conducted on 50 participants in each group. Six PCOS samples were excluded due to poor sample quality or missing data, resulting in a final sample size of 100 (50 per group) for all comparisons and correlation analyses. The exact number of data points used in each analysis was consistent. The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed the normality of paired differences, allowing the use of paired t-tests for comparison of measured variables. Pearson’s correlation was performed to examine associations between REEs and OS markers. Differences between correlation coefficients in the PCOS and control groups were assessed using Fisher’s z-transformation followed by a two-tailed z-test. To account for the issue of multiple hypothesis testing, P-values were adjusted using both the Bonferroni correction and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (FDR). For Bonferroni correction, the significance threshold was set at P < 0.003. For the FDR, adjusted P-values were evaluated at a significant level of 0.05. Scatter plots were used to visualize correlations between REEs, MDA, GSH, and SOD.

Title: The PCOS Phenotypes in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study: participant clinical features and data harmonization on analysis of individual participant data

Abstract: BackgroundPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifaceted condition with diagnostic challenges and clinical heterogeneity across populations. Research priorities include enhanced accuracy in defining cut-offs for diagnostic features. Here, we aim to describe participant clinical features and data harmonization in the international PCOS Phenotype in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study.MethodsWe searched EMBASE and Medline (Ovid) from 1990 to October 2, 2020, in population-based, medically unbiased study cohorts. Included studies had ≥ 300 participants, directly assessed PCOS-related features, and provided Individual Participant Data (IPD). Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS tool. Data integrity was ensured via cross-referencing, identifying outliers/implausible data, and variable harmonization. Reporting follows PRISMA-IPD guidelines, summarizing findings with frequencies and proportions.ResultsThe study included 9979 reproductive-age women from 12 studies across eight countries (China, Iran, Italy, Nigeria, Russia, South Korea, Turkey, and the USA), representing 11 ethnicities. Ovulatory dysfunction was variably recorded, from mean menstrual cycle length, minimum or maximum cycle length, number of cycles per year, or urinary progesterone measurements. Clinical hyperandrogenism was assessed via modified Ferriman–Gallwey (mFG) scores, with a few also including acne and alopecia. Biochemical hyperandrogenism thresholds varied (95th, 97.5th, or 98th percentile of healthy controls). Polycystic ovary morphology was assessed via transvaginal, transabdominal, or transrectal approaches. Harmonization adhered to International PCOS Guidelines for ovulatory dysfunction, ethnicity-specific cut-offs for hirsutism (via k-means clustering), and 95th percentile thresholds for biochemical hyperandrogenism. PCOS prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 19.8% in the original studies and was 11.0% overall after harmonization.ConclusionsThe P-PUP study offers an unprecedented, ethnically diverse, medically unbiased population-based cohort, an extraordinarily valuable tool to enhance knowledge and research in PCOS. However, variability in data collection methods and definitions of PCOS diagnostic features across studies limited the ability to fully integrate data for analysis. Despite these limitations, we optimized harmonization in this IPD, and the findings provided valuable insights into the challenges of data harmonization and established a foundation for future collaborative research. Future research should focus on standardizing data collection, establishing normative cut-offs based on true natural groupings, and linking diagnostic clusters to outcomes in diverse populations.Protocol registrationCRD42021267847.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12916-025-04221-9.

Body: Background
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrinopathy with significant long-term reproductive, metabolic, dermatological, and psychological health impacts [1]. According to the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines criteria, diagnosis in adults is based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: (1) oligo-/anovulation (OA); (2) clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA); and (3) either polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound or elevated serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels [2–5]. In adolescents, the diagnosis requires both OA and HA [2–5]. It is estimated that 10–13% of women worldwide are affected by PCOS, and the global incidence is reportedly increasing, making PCOS a major public health concern [2–6]. PCOS and its associated health implications generate substantive health [7, 8] and economic burdens for individuals, societies, and governments [9–12].

      Despite increasing research and publications on PCOS [13], the pathogenesis remains unclear and there are significant persisting challenges in diagnosis. This is attributable to its multifaceted and heterogeneous clinical presentation, the lack of gold-standard diagnostic tests, ethnic variation, and the fact that most studies are carried out in medically biased (clinically based) populations [14–19]. It is also due to the multiple components of the diagnostic criteria, which are all continuous variables [20–22], the paucity of data on normative cut-off thresholds for each diagnostic component within unselected, diverse populations [23, 24], and the use of arbitrary diagnostic cut-offs across studies [25–31]. This contributes to delayed or inaccurate diagnosis of PCOS, hindering timely and appropriate interventions to limit complications and treat the condition [12, 32–35].
      These challenges underscore the importance of consolidating data from diverse populations for a more comprehensive understanding of the condition [16]. While traditional systematic reviews and meta-analyses represent an improvement over single-center studies, they are limited by aggregated data from original studies with varying methodologies, sample sizes, and study populations. Conversely, the PCOS Phenotype in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study, is a large-scale, international individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis designed to address identified challenges, allowing harmonization of raw data from individual studies, standardization of cut-offs and analyses across studies and examination of individual-level variables to advance knowledge on PCOS etiology, diagnosis and clinical features in unselected community-based populations [36].
      This report on the P-PUP study aims to (a) outline the selection criteria and study identification process for the study, (b) describe the clinical features of the populations included, and (c) detail the data harmonization process for PCOS diagnostic criteria and features within the study.
    
    
      Methods
      
        Protocol and registration
        The protocol for the P-PUP study was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021267847) and published previously [36]. This study was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of Individual Participant Data guideline [37].
      
      
        Selection of studies
        The methodology for the selection and identification of research groups and collaborators has been described previously [36]. In summary, a systematic search of the EMBASE and Medline (Ovid) databases, along with a manual Google search, was conducted from 1990 to October 2, 2020, to identify eligible unselected population-based cohort studies. Key search terms included PCOS, ovulatory dysfunction (OD), hirsutism, polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM), and unselected populations, among others. A full search strategy for Medline (Ovid) is in Additional file 1: Table S1. The PCOS research community (RA and HJT) was consulted to identify any potentially ongoing or unpublished studies.
        Cross-sectional or longitudinal cohort studies were considered eligible if they were published after 1990 (after a change in diagnostic criteria), included a sample size of 300 or more unselected women of any age, ethnicity, or weight, and directly assessed features related to PCOS [36]. These features of PCOS included measurement of ovulatory dysfunction, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. No language restrictions were imposed. Studies that relied on self-reported or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for PCOS status without the assessment of PCOS features were excluded. Exclusion criteria at the participant level included pregnant and lactating women, women with natural/surgical menopause, ovarian pathology, and women meeting the criteria for exclusion of other conditions in the diagnosis of PCOS. Additionally, women receiving contraceptive hormonal treatment within 3 months of assessment were excluded from the androgen analysis.
        Titles and abstracts were initially screened by a single reviewer (SK), and then full-text articles were retrieved and assessed in duplicate (SK and ADB) with any discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer (HJT). The corresponding and/or lead authors of the identified studies were contacted and requested to contribute to deidentified IPD for integration and analysis. For authors who did not respond, two reminder emails were sent.
      
      
        Data collection processes
        Data and relevant dictionaries were transferred to the ISO 27001-certified Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) [38] which restricts access and control to the authorized data custodian and researchers. The key variables collected aligned with the PCOS core outcomes set [39] and included sociodemographic factors (age and race/ethnicity); generic outcomes (weight, height, body mass index (BMI)), metabolic outcomes (waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profiles, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose (FBG)); dermatological (hirsutism as measured by modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG score) and reproductive outcomes (androgen assays, menstrual cycle length, number of menstrual cycles per year, age of menarche, and PCOM features including antral follicle count (AFC) and ovarian volume (OV)). Any data discrepancies or concerns were discussed and resolved with the original study investigators.
      
      
        Risk of bias assessment
        We evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies providing IPD using the AXIS appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies [40]. The appraisal was conducted by two independent reviewers (ADB and RRD), and any discrepancies were resolved through consensus. This tool consists of 20 items that assess various aspects such as the study’s aim, design, sample size, outcome variable measurement, statistical methods, response rate, result consistency, discussion and conclusion, limitations, and ethical approval, with responses categorized as “yes,” “no,” or “don’t know” [41]. Overall quality was rated as low (score 1-7), medium (score 8-14), or high (score 15-20) [41].
      
      
        Data harmonization and analysis
        Data synthesis involved rigorous procedures to ensure data integrity and harmonization across diverse datasets. All laboratory measurements were standardized to the International System of Units (SI) for consistency. Outliers were identified using scatter plots and box plots, applying a criterion where values exceeding > 5 or > 10 standard deviations were flagged [42]. Invalid or implausible data points, such as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) surpassing systolic blood pressure (SBP), and height < 120 cm were identified, based on consensus clinical judgment and predefined criteria. Definitions of outliers, invalid data points, and rules for variable harmonization were documented and collaboratively discussed with original study investigators to achieve consensus on data handling (Additional File 1: Table S4).
        For the harmonized definition of PCOS, we adhered to the International PCOS Guideline criteria, requiring two of three key features: OD, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. The specific criteria for each feature were defined as follows:◦ OD: Menstrual cycles numbering fewer than eight or exceeding 17 per year, and/or cycle lengths shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days.◦ Clinical hyperandrogenism: Defined by hirsutism quantified through the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) scoring system. We analyzed ethnic distribution patterns of mFG scores using descriptive statistics of means and medians. Subsequently, we standardized the data (mean = 0, SD = 1) and performed a k-means cluster analysis (k = 2), with cluster determination guided by the average silhouette method, following our previously published methodology [43].◦ Biochemical hyperandrogenism: Defined using study-specific 95th percentile cut-offs for first-line androgen tests (TT, FT, cFT, and FAI), supplemented by secondary markers (A4 and DHEAS) when first-line tests yielded negative results. This approach accounts for variations in assay methods and reference ranges across studies.◦ Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM): Given the considerable heterogeneity in imaging modalities, ultrasound approaches, and absence of individual participant data (IPD), harmonization of PCOM data proved unfeasible; thus, we relied on each study's original definitions and categorizations for this criterion.
        This study undertook a one-stage approach for analysis and only included women of reproductive age between 18 and 45 years. Continuous variables were reported as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), as appropriate for the distribution of data. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and proportions. Available case analysis was employed, and we did not opt to undertake multiple imputations for any missing data because they could not be random. Stata 18 software was used for data management and analysis.

        Study characteristics and risk of bias
        The literature search identified 6507 publications, from which 1437 duplicates were removed. After screening the titles and abstracts, 342 studies underwent full-text review of which 313 studies were excluded (Additional File 1: Table S2). Finally, 29 studies met the eligibility criteria and their authors were contacted. Of these, the authors of 19 studies, encompassing 31,580 participants, did not respond. Of the 10 authors who responded, seven expressed willingness to collaborate and completed the data-sharing process, whereas three studies involving a combined total of 17,439 participants were unable to do so [44–46]. Additionally, two ongoing studies were identified through other researchers, and two authors contributed more than one study from different populations. The entire P-PUP study dataset encompassed 12 population-based medically unbiased representative cohorts [26, 31, 47–56] and 12,513 participants drawn from PCOS research groups spanning eight countries internationally (Fig. 1). A detailed assessment of the included studies’ methodological quality appraisal is presented in Additional File 1: Table S3. All of the included studies had a low risk of bias (high quality) [26, 31, 47–56].Fig. 1PRISMA IPD flow diagram for P-PUP study selection
        Table 1 presents the characteristics of the final included studies. The entire P-PUP study dataset included studies from China (n = 2; 4645 women) [48, 52], Iran (n = 3; 2517 women) [49, 53, 54], Italy (n = 1; 519 women) [50], Russia (n = 1; 2695 women), South Korea (n = 1; 499 women) [26], Turkey (n = 1; 392 women) [51], the USA (n = 2; 806 women) [55, 56], and Nigeria (n = 1; 440 women) [47]. All studies were cross-sectional in design with sample sizes ranging from 392 to 3000.

        Participant selection after data harmonization
        Of the total 12,513 participants in the P-PUP study, 2046 were excluded due to missing data on age (n = 6), age < 18 years (n = 609), age > 45 (n = 1178), natural/surgical menopause (n = 81), current pregnancy/lactation (n = 40), and ovarian pathology (n = 48). Additionally, 488 participants were excluded due to abnormal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH > 25 IU/L), prolactin (> 67.2 µg/L), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP > 30 nmol/L), or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH > 5 µU/mL) (Fig. 2, Additional File 1: Table S4). A total number of 9979 participants was included in the final analysis following data harmonization. The predominant ethnicities represented in reproductive-age women were 40.1% Asian Han Chinese, 23.8% White Iranians, and 9.5% White Russians (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Flow chart for study participant selection. Note: TSH, prolactin, and 17-OHP were not consistently collected across the total populations in the studies, as some studies collect the data on women suspected of having PCOSFig. 3Ethnicity distribution of the study participants
      
      
        Assessment of ovulatory dysfunction
        All studies collected information on ovulatory dysfunction (OD) through the assessment of menstrual cycles, but the data collection methods were heterogeneous. Four studies collected data about OD in categorical form [48, 52, 55, 56], with differing cut-offs: fewer than 21 days, 21–35 days, or greater than 35 days [52]; 35 days or less or greater than 35 days [56]; less than 26 days and greater than 35 days [55]; and another reported it as a binary with regular (21–35 days) or irregular (fewer than 21 days, greater than 35 days or irregular bleeding) [48]. Six studies collected actual menstrual cycle length [26, 31, 47, 49, 53, 54], seven studies collected the number of menstrual cycles per year [31, 47, 49–51, 53, 54], and one study recorded the minimum and maximum menstrual cycle lengths, in addition to the overall menstrual cycle length [31]. One study also reported minimum and maximum cycle lengths and cycle numbers per year in addition to the categorical menstrual cycle status, with nearly 60% missing data [48]. Except for one study [31] which had 4% (62/1550) missing data, the remaining studies provided complete data on OD (Additional file 1: Table S5).
        The definitions of OD varied across studies and are summarized in Table 1. Most studies defined OD based on menstrual cycle length or the number of menstrual cycles per year, with some including progesterone levels to further assess ovulation status. OD was most commonly defined by using an upper limit of menstrual cycle length greater than 35 days [31, 47–49, 52–56], with another study using a threshold of greater than 34 days [51]. The lower limit for menstrual cycle length also varied, with three studies using less than 21 days [31, 48, 49, 53], one study using less than 24 days [51], one using less than 26 days [55], and another one using less than 25 days [47]. For the number of menstrual cycles per year, four studies defined OD as less than eight menstrual cycles per year [26, 31, 47, 52], while two studies used the cut-off of fewer than nine cycles per year [55, 56]. Additionally, three studies incorporated a lack of menses for three consecutive months as part of their OD definition [26, 49–51, 54, 55]. Mid-luteal progesterone level was utilized by three studies as part of their assessment of OD [51, 54, 55]. The reported prevalence of OD in the included studies ranged from 9.2 to 31.9%, with an overall aggregated prevalence of 18.2%. For data harmonization, we defined OD as fewer than eight or more than 17 menstrual cycles per year and/or a menstrual cycle length of less than 21 days or greater than 35 days, in alignment with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines [2–5]. Based on this definition, the prevalence of OD across the included studies ranged from 3.7 to 31.9%, with an overall prevalence of 15.3% (Table 2).

        Assessment of clinical hyperandrogenism
        All included studies assessed clinical hyperandrogenism, using hirsutism as a primary criterion [26, 31, 47–56]. Hirsutism was assessed directly by a health professional, including gynecologists, midwives, physicians, nurses, endocrinologists, and general practitioners using the mFG score. Hirsutism was defined by an mFG score of 6 or higher in six studies [26, 47, 48, 51, 55, 56], 8 or higher in five studies [49, 50, 52–54], and 5 or higher in one study [31].
        All studies reported acne [26, 31, 47–56], with nine providing IPD [26, 47, 49, 50, 52–56], and three incorporating acne into their definition of clinical hyperandrogenism [48, 52, 54]. One study employed the Burke-Cunliffe acne grading method, assessed by a physician [50]; six studies employed the standard acne lesion assessment of the face, back, and chest, assessed by gynecologists, midwives, physicians, and general practitioners [31, 47, 49, 52–54]; two studies mentioned that no specific acne scoring system was used, with assessments conducted by nurses [55, 56], while another two studies did not provide details on the acne scoring tools used, with assessments conducted by physicians [48, 51]. One study used self-reported acne without a specific scoring system [26]. Among studies that included acne in their clinical hyperandrogenism definition, a score of two or higher was used in one study [52], six or higher in another [54], and the cut-off was not specified in one study [48].
        Six studies reported on the presence of female pattern hair loss (FPHL) [31, 47, 50, 52, 54, 55], with four providing IPD [47, 50, 54, 55], and two incorporated FPHL into their definition of clinical hyperandrogenism [50, 54]. The presence of FPHL was assessed by gynecologists, physicians, nurses, and general practitioners using the Ludwig scale in three studies [31, 50, 52], while three other studies provided no details on the FPHL assessment tool used [47, 54, 55]. FPHL was reported in a categorized form in two studies with no cut-offs provided [50, 54].
        For data harmonization, we defined clinical hyperandrogenism using hirsutism only in alignment with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines which highlights hirsutism as the strongest predictor of hyperandrogenism. We used ethnicity-specific mFG score cut-offs derived from k-means (k = 2) cluster analysis in our recent publication [43]. The thresholds were set at mFG score ≥ 8 for Iranians, ≥ 7 for White Italians and Black Africans, ≥ 5 for Asian Han Chinese, White Russians, Turkish, and Black Americans, and ≥ 4 for White Americans, Asian Koreans, Asian Russians, and Mixed Russians [43]. Based on these cut-offs, the prevalence of clinical hyperandrogenism ranged from 8.1 to 34.2% in individual included studies, with an overall aggregate prevalence of 14.2% (Table 3).

        Assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism
        Biochemical hyperandrogenism was assessed in all included studies except for one study done in Nigeria [47]. Seven studies assessed all participants [31, 48–51, 53, 56], three studies [26, 54, 55] assessed selective subgroups, and the remaining one study collected blood samples from a random half of the population [52]. Among the studies that assessed androgen levels in selective subgroups, Tehrani et al. assessed only participants with either hirsutism (mFG score ≥ 8) or menstrual disorder (26% of the sample, 260/1000) [54]; Azziz et al. assessed only participants with menstrual dysfunction (48.7% of the sample, 189/388) [55]; and Kim et al. assessed participants who consented to provide blood samples (32.1% of the sample, 160/499) [26].
        Of the included studies, 11 reported total testosterone (TT) [26, 31, 48–54, 56], seven reported calculated free androgen index (FAI) [26, 31, 49, 51–54], eight reported androstenedione (A4) [49–56], and nine reported dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) [26, 31, 49–51, 53–56]. The assay method used included enzyme immunoassay (EIA) [49, 53, 54], liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) [31, 50], chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) [31, 51, 52], radioimmunoassay (RIA) after extraction [55, 56], and RIA [26, 48, 51, 55, 56] (Table 1). Three studies reported free testosterone (FT) [48, 55, 56]: two reported calculated FT (cFT), derived from TT measured by an in-house RIA after serum extraction and SHBG binding activity by equilibrium dialysis using Sephadex G-25 and [3H]T as the ligand, and approximations for binding to albumin [55, 56], while one study reported directly measured FT utilizing RIA [48].
        Biochemical hyperandrogenism was defined using the selected control subgroups as above 95th percentile in eight studies [26, 49, 51–56], above 97.5th percentile in one study [50], above 97.7th percentile (equivalent to 2 standard deviations above the mean in normally distributed data) in another study [48], and above 98th percentile in one study [31] (Table 1). The prevalence of biochemical hyperandrogenism varied widely across studies, ranging from 5.6 to 30.0%, with an overall prevalence of 17.4%. In this study, we adapted the 95th percentile cut-off specific to each study for harmonization to account for variations in assay methods and reference ranges across studies. We used first-line tests (TT, FT, cFT, and FAI) and second-line tests (A4 and DHEAS) when first-line tests were negative, as per the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines. This approach revealed a biochemical hyperandrogenism prevalence ranging from 11.0 to 30.3%, with an overall prevalence of 20.4%. The overall prevalence remained nearly the same at 20.2% when studies assessing selective subgroups of populations were excluded (Table 4).

The reported laboratory values were converted to the SI unit using the following conversion factors: for A4 3.49 from ng/mL to nmol/L and 0.00349 from pg/mL to nmol/L; for TT 3.47 from ng/mL to nmol/L and 0.0347 from ng/dL to nmol/L; for FT 0.003467 from pg/mL to nmol/L and 0.03467 from ng/dL to nmol/L; for DHEAS 0.00271 ng/mL to µmol/L and 0.0271 µg/dL to µmol/L. For data harmonization, we utilized the 95th percentile cut-off specific to each individual study population, applying first-line tests (TT, FT, and FAI) and incorporating A4 and DHEAS when first-line tests were negative, in accordance with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines
      
      
        Assessment of polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM)
        Eight included studies assessed all participants for PCOM. One study provided PCOM as a binary variable [49], OV data was provided by six studies [26, 31, 47, 48, 51, 52], while AFC was provided by seven studies [26, 31, 47, 48, 51–53]. The imaging modalities used included transvaginal ultrasound with a band frequency ranging from 5 to 13 MHz, and transabdominal ultrasound with a band frequency ranging from 1 to 9 MHz. Additionally, transrectal ultrasound was utilized in two studies [26, 52]. Unfortunately, the IPD in the included studies did not specify the ultrasound approach, either transvaginal, transabdominal, or transrectal.
        Except for Makwe et al. which defined PCOM as having an AFC count of ≥ 20 and/or OV ≥ 10cm3 [47], all other included studies used older criteria, defining PCOM as having an AFC count of ≥ 12 and/or OV ≥ 10cm3 [26, 31, 48, 49, 51–53]. The reported prevalence of PCOM varied widely across studies, ranging from 6.6 to 39.9%, with an overall prevalence of 19.2% (Table 5). Due to the heterogeneity in imaging modalities, ultrasound approaches, and lack of IPD, data harmonization for PCOM was not feasible, and thus we relied on each study’s original definitions and categorization.

        Prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
        Of the included study, eight defined PCOS using the Rotterdam criteria [26, 31, 47–49, 51–53], while the remaining four used the National Institutes of Health (NIH 1990) criteria and did not include ultrasound data for PCOM [50, 54–56]. The reported prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 19.8%, with an overall prevalence of 11.7% using each study’s original definition. For data harmonization, we defined PCOS by applying the International PCOS Guidelines criteria, requiring two out of three key features: OD, hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. We defined OD as fewer than eight or more than 17 menstrual cycles per year and/or a menstrual cycle length of less than 21 days or greater than 35 days; we defined hyperandrogenism as either clinical (limited to ethnicity-specific hirsutism scores) or biochemical (using study-specific 95th percentile cut-offs for first-line androgen tests, supplemented by secondary markers when first-line tests were negative), in accordance with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines recommendations. Post harmonization, the prevalence of PCOS ranged from 3.3 to 18.3%, with an overall prevalence of 11.0% (Table 6).

      Discussion
      The P-PUP study represents the first international IPD-based meta-analysis involving unselected (medically unbiased) women from the general population, assessed for PCOS features, offering a unique and diverse cohort to explore PCOS characteristics across heterogeneous populations. This comprehensive dataset includes a large sample size of 9979 women aged 18–45 years from 11 primary ethnicities, eight countries and four continents. Our analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in data collection methods and the definitions used for PCOS diagnostic features, particularly in the assessment of ovulatory dysfunction. This variability contributed to a wide range of reported prevalence of PCOS across original studies, from 3.3 to 19.8% (11.7% overall). After data harmonization, the PCOS prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 18.3%, with an overall prevalence of 11.0%.
      Ovulatory dysfunction (OD) is a key component in the International Guidelines PCOS diagnostic criteria, focused on menstrual cyclicity, and irregular cycle length and number per year. The International PCOS Guidelines [2–6], defined irregular cycles as > 90 days for any one cycle in women 1-year post menarche, < 21 or > 45 days in women one to less than 3 years post menarche, < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year in women 3 years post-menarche to perimenopause, while acknowledging the need for further research [57]. We identified significant variations in menstrual cycle data collection, especially prior to the International PCOS Guidelines. Categorical and continuous data was collected, including average cycle length in days, average cycle number per year, minimum and maximum cycle length and cycle number per year. OD cut-offs were variable across studies. Here, we harmonized OD data aligned with Guideline recommendations, reporting a prevalence of 3.7% to 31.9% or 15.5% overall. Future studies should collect standardized continuous data on cycle length (in days) and cycle number per year, with clear explanations of cycle length as the number of days from the first day of one period to the first day of the next, to limit confusion with the duration of menstrual bleeding. While acknowledging the inherent variability of cycles in PCOS and limitations of self-reported data for large-scale epidemiology studies, standardized data collection and definitions would substantially minimize error while ensuring consistency and comparability across studies. The International PCOS Guideline’s OD cut-offs were derived from the 95th percentile of menstrual cycle duration, based on variable control populations which likely included women with PCOS [58]. Using this percentile as a diagnostic cut-off, particularly when it is not linked with clinical outcomes, including anthropometric outcomes (weight, waist-hip circumference, BMI), reproductive outcomes (androgens, ovulation frequency, pregnancy complications), and cardiometabolic (insulin resistance, lipid profiles, blood pressure, fasting glucose), represents a crude and overly simplistic approach [58]. Moving forward, applying advanced analytics including cluster analysis to define cut-offs based on well-defined unselected populations and clinical correlates such as association with other PCOS features or with long-term outcomes is a research priority captured in the International PCOS Research Road Map [59].
      Hyperandrogenism is an essential PCOS diagnostic feature and manifests clinically as hirsutism, acne and androgenic alopecia. Acne and androgenic alopecia are relatively nonspecific markers of hyperandrogenism, particularly in PCOS [2–5, 16]. While validated scoring systems exist for acne and androgenic alopecia, these are not universally agreed upon for PCOS due to limited research in PCOS populations, ethnic variations, and clinical contexts. In included original studies, acne and alopecia were inconsistently reported, with variable tools and definitions. In contrast, hirsutism is strongly correlated with biochemical hyperandrogenism and is the most reliable clinical sign of hyperandrogenism in PCOS [60, 61]. The modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) visual scale is Guideline recommended [62] and was used in all included original studies. Historically, a cut-off mFG score of ≥ 8 defined hirsutism in PCOS, based on a misinterpretation of original Ferriman and Gallwey data at the 95th percentile of a predominantly white population [63, 64]. In P-PUP IPD we established ethnicity-specific mFG cut-offs via k-means cluster analysis, with cut-offs ranging between 4–6 for the majority of populations [43]. This aligns with the International PCOS Guidelines recommendations for an mFG score of 4–6 to diagnose hirsutism [2–5]. Clinical hyperandrogenism ranged from 6.8 to 28.4% (13.7% overall) in original studies with variable mFG cut-offs and use of acne and alopecia. With cluster analysis cut-offs and data harmonization, we report a prevalence of 8.1% to 34.2% (14.2% overall) and aligned to Guidelines, cluster-defined mFG cut-offs are recommended.
      Biochemical hyperandrogenism in PCOS focuses on elevated free testosterone, which may be measured directly or calculated primarily through FAI and cFT. Our recent systematic review and meta-analysis informed the International PCOS Guidelines recommendation to use TT and FT as a first-line laboratory test for biochemical hyperandrogenism [65] using LC–MS/MS methods with the best accuracy [66, 67]. In the P-PUP study, only two original studies used LC–MS/MS [31, 50], all others relied on less specific and sensitive immunoassay. Cut-offs for biochemical hyperandrogenism varied, with arbitrary thresholds at the 95th, 97.5th, or 98th percentile of healthy controls. In P-PUP we adapted the 95th percentile cut-off for androgens specific to each study to harmonize data reporting a prevalence from 11.0 to 30.3% in original studies, with an overall prevalence of 20.4%. Further cluster analyses are underway to refine definitions and address persisting limitations.
      PCOM is evaluated using pelvic ultrasonography and is characterized by either ovarian enlargement, measured as increased OV, and/or an excess of small antral follicles, either within the entire ovary (FNPO) or a single cross-sectional image (FNPS) [68]. Cut-offs for OV and FNPO vary by ultrasound technology and approach. The 2023 International PCOS Guidelines recommend the transvaginal ultrasound approach, FNPO ≥ 20 in at least one ovary or OV ≥ 10 ml to define PCOM in adults. If older ultrasound technology is used, the AFC count is ≥ 12 in at least one ovary. PCOM is not recommended in adolescents as it lacks specificity [2–5]. In the present analysis, only one study adhered to these recommendations and transabdominal and transrectal ultrasound approaches were also used, with no validated PCOM cut-offs, limiting harmonization and resulting in the retention of original study definitions. Guidelines now clearly recommend a transvaginal ultrasound, and cut-offs for FNPO and OV which need to be applied, along with the inclusion of AMH measurements.
      
        Strengths and limitations
        This study has several strengths. Firstly, this IPD is unique and includes a large diverse, international IPD set, with generalizability to those with PCOS. Unselected participants also minimize selection bias, as seen in clinic-based cohorts. Also, the IPD analysis allowed standardization of definitions and cut-offs across studies and aligned with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines to minimize heterogeneity and enhance comparability. Limitations include heterogeneity in data collection methods, particularly for ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. Some original data could not be harmonized, affecting the comparability of results across populations. Most original studies relied on immunoassays for androgen measurement, which are less accurate than LC-MS/MS. Most studies also used older ultrasound technology and variable approaches and lacked sufficient methodological detail, with reliance on original study PCOM definitions. Although serum AMH is now recommended as an alternative marker for PCOM, this data was not available. Lastly, although the study included participants from four continents and eight countries, including participants from diverse ethnic backgrounds enhanced generalizability, notable geographic and cultural gaps in representation persist, underscoring the need for more globally comprehensive PCOS research.
      
    
    
      Conclusions
      The P-PUP study brings together an unprecedented cohort of ethnically diverse, unselected population-level data to enable research and advance knowledge in PCOS. In integrating this IPD we have shown a lack of standardized data collection methods across original studies. Cut-offs for PCOS diagnostic features also vary, jeopardizing diagnostic accuracy and consistency and impacting data harmonization. This work directly addresses the high research priorities identified in the PCOS Guidelines research roadmap, which emphasizes creating international data repositories and standardizing research approaches [59]. Future research efforts should prioritize the standardization of data collection methods that align with the International PCOS Guidelines and PCOS core outcome sets [39], while simultaneously refining definitions and establishing accurate normative cut-offs for individual PCOS diagnostic features. These diagnostic thresholds should be based on cluster analysis and natural groupings, identifying diagnostic clusters that are linked to short and long-term outcomes in medically unbiased, unselected, and diverse populations. This dual approach to standardization would facilitate big data integration and the development of machine learning–driven models for precision medicine in PCOS.

Title: Antirheumatic Medication Calendar Significantly Improves Adherence in First-Time Methotrexate Users: A Prospective, Single-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract: PurposeMethotrexate is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis; however, the adherence rate greatly varies due to its weekly dosing schedule. Incorrect administration can lead to disease progression and toxicity. To design a graphic-based medication calendar aiming to improve adherence in first-time methotrexate users.Patients and MethodsThis prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial included participants aged 18–75 years who were starting methotrexate for the first time or resuming it after a 3-month break. Seventy-nine participants from October 1, 2023, to January 30, 2024, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the calendar (38 participants) or control (41 participants) group for 6 weeks and followed up for 2, 6, and 10 weeks. The primary outcome was methotrexate adherence, assessed by the proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100%.ResultsAfter 6 and 10 weeks, the calendar group had a higher proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100% compared with the control group (97.2% vs 73.2%, P < 0.004; 88.9% vs 68.9%, P < 0.03, respectively) and a higher correct medication adherence rate within 10 weeks (87.81% vs 69%, P = 0.0307). Compared with the control group, the calendar group had a significantly higher rate of on-time return visits during both follow-up visits (97.2% vs 78.0% and 91.7% vs 70.7%, respectively). Additionally, 94.74% of the calendar group patients believed the intervention improved their adherence and wished to continue using it.ConclusionThe antirheumatic medication calendar improved initial methotrexate adherence; however, its effect diminished following its discontinuation.Clinical Trial RegistrationChiCTR2300076228 (2023–09-27).

Body: Introduction
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting approximately 1% of the global population. In China, the prevalence of RA is 0.2–0.37%.1 The main symptoms of RA include pain, joint swelling, and stiffness. Chronic inflammation caused by pathological activation of the immune system gradually destroys the bone, leading to joint deformities and disability.2 Long-term immune intervention can effectively suppress joint destruction and slow disease progression.
      In the 1960s, methotrexate was first used to treat RA and has become the first choice for RA treatment owing to its efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness.3 Methotrexate, a folic acid antagonist, regulates inflammatory cells in synovial membranes, inhibits the production of inflammatory factors, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects through adenosine signaling pathways.4
      However, the effectiveness of methotrexate is often limited by poor patient adherence. The typical methotrexate dose in standard RA treatment is 10–25 mg per week. Low-dose methotrexate guarantees efficacy and safety simultaneously. However, administration at a 1-week interval requires diligent patient adherence. Adherence rates vary between 59% (underuse) and 107% (overuse), and are lower (38%) in China compared to other countries.5–7 Non-adherence to methotrexate is associated with high disease activity and worse joint function.8 Additionally, poor adherence, including an overdose of methotrexate, leads to serious adverse reactions and even death.9
      Fear of adverse reactions and treatment disappointment are the most common reasons for patients to stop taking methotrexate.10 Therefore, measures to change patients’ cognition, such as patient education programs, motivational interview training, psychological intervention, and medical communication, can effectively reduce the occurrence of patients’ voluntary discontinuation of medication.11–13 However, most of the patients who did not stop taking medication had incorrect medication, including reducing the dose, skipping the dose, and even taking an overdose.14 Incorrect use of methotrexate will increase the frequency and severity of adverse reactions, reduce the therapeutic effect, and undermine patients’ trust in the treatment plan. Switching to subcutaneous injection of methotrexate has improved patient adherence,14 but it is not suitable for all patients with RA. Measures such as using emails, text messages, or phone reminders have a positive effect on the accuracy of patients’ medication;15 however, they are not suitable for older patients who are not proficient in using electronic devices. The picture-based medication calendar can remind patients of the time and dosage of medication intuitively and concisely, and can be viewed and recorded by patients at any time. It is an adherence management tool with great potential. In the field of tumor treatment, medication calendars have been proven to effectively improve medication compliance, meet family care needs, assist medication supervision, and help cultivate the habit of correct medication.16 However, there are few studies on the design of antirheumatic drug calendars for RA treatment. Additionally, the development of personalized medication calendars remains challenging. There are differences in calendar creation, and a simplified method is needed to create medication calendars. This study aims to develop an antirheumatic drug calendar based on a graphic combination design with an adjustable dose label to achieve personalized adherence reminders and verify its effectiveness in improving methotrexate medication adherence in patients with RA through a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial.
    
    
      Materials and Methods
      
        Trial Design
        The 2010 Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines for reporting randomized controlled trials were followed to describe the methods used in this study. To develop an antirheumatic medication calendar and evaluate its effectiveness in improving methotrexate adherence, we conducted a prospective, single-blind, randomized controlled trial. Patient recruitment took place between October 2023 and January 2024 at Ningbo Sixth Hospital, a tertiary orthopedic center renowned for its expertise in orthopedic disease management in eastern Zhejiang, China. Recruitment was continuous without interruption. All recruited patients were administered methotrexate for the first time or had discontinued its use for >3 months to eliminate the influence of prior methotrexate use. The patients were divided into the medication calendar group and the control group. One researcher generated the group number for participants using a randomly generated sequence in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA), while another concealed the numbers using masked envelopes. When a patient met the inclusion criteria, the physician opened the envelope on-site to determine the group allocation. The allocation ratio was 1:1. All research data were collated using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp.) and analyzed by another researcher who was blinded to the allocation. Supplementary Figure S1 displays the study flow diagram.
        The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, approved by the Ethics Committee of Ningbo Sixth Hospital (license number: 2023–06 [X]), and registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on September 27, 2023 (ChiCTR2300076228).
      
      
        Eligibility of Participants
        The eligibility of patients was confirmed by a rheumatologist and a researcher. Randomization was performed after the patients signed an informed consent form. Patient information was recorded and saved in Microsoft Excel, and it was maintained and updated by a researcher who was blinded to the randomization.
        The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) age >18 years; (ii) adherence to the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 RA classification criteria and an RA diagnosis by a rheumatologist;17 (iii) requirement of methotrexate treatment as determined by a rheumatologist; and (iv) either first-time use of methotrexate or discontinuation of methotrexate for >3 months. The reasons for discontinuation were low compliance and voluntary discontinuation by the patient.
        The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) contraindications to methotrexate or a history of adverse reactions to methotrexate; (ii) inability to understand the medication calendar; (iii) inability to take care of oneself; (iv) having a mental illness or unconsciousness; and (v) refusal to follow-up or sign the informed consent form.
      
      
        Interventions
        The medication calendar in this study was designed by a research team consisting of clinicians, clinical pharmacists, and nursing staff and was adjusted based on the patient’s experience and suggestions in the preliminary trial. The medication calendar comprised a calendar and a drug label. It was a monthly calendar with white text on a dark background for weekdays and a blue background for weekends. The date was enlarged, and the lunar calendar was added to make reading easier for older adults. The drug label included the outer packaging, color, and shape of methotrexate tablets, and the number of pills to be taken. Certain areas of the drug label were covered with an ink layer that, when scratched, revealed the words “taken” or “booked”. This feature helped reduce patients’ errors in medication intake and minimized instances of missed follow-up visits. The calendar and label were mass-produced, matched, and combined according to the doctor’s instructions (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S2).
Figure 1Calendar design tracking dosages and medication schedules.
        Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the medication calendar group or control group in a 1:1 ratio. All patients received drug education from rheumatologists, nurses, and pharmacists before receiving the first dose, including information on usage and dosage, pharmacological effects, adverse reactions, and follow-up requirements. All patients had labels on the outer packaging of the medicine, including usage, dosage, and frequency of use. All patients received their first dose of methotrexate (7.5 mg) for 2 weeks, after which the physician evaluated the patient’s condition and adjusted the methotrexate dose for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, the physician evaluated the patient’s condition and adjusted the methotrexate dose. Patients in the medication calendar group were given a medication calendar matching the dose for 6 weeks, whereas those in the control group were not. Follow-ups were conducted at 2, 6, and 10 weeks to evaluate the impact of the medication calendar on patient adherence (Supplementary Figure S3). When distributing the medication calendar, the researchers demonstrated to the patients how to use it correctly and asked them to explain it again to ensure that they could use it independently. At each follow-up visit, the researchers confirmed whether the patients used the medication calendar correctly. Patients who did not use the calendar correctly or did not use it at all were excluded.
      
      
        Outcomes
        The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients achieving a proportion of days covered (PDC) value of 100%. The impact of medication calendar use and discontinuation was evaluated at 6 and 10 weeks. The PDC value was calculated as follows: number of days of correct medication within a certain period after the first dose of methotrexate divided by the total number of days. Secondary outcomes included the PDC value, the correct patient adherence rate, the rate of correct medication use at each follow-up time point, the rate of subsequent visits, RA disease activity, and patient satisfaction. RA disease activity was measured using the Disease Activity Score 28 with C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP). Patient satisfaction was assessed using a 5-point Likert scale based on whether they wanted to continue using the medication calendar. Safety outcomes included adverse reactions to methotrexate. Medication errors were classified into four categories.
        “Wrong time:” Taking the correct dose at the wrong time (patients have an inaccurate memory of time).
        “Missed medication:” Not taking medication at the correct time (patients have an accurate memory of time).
        “Take less medication:” Not taking enough doses at the correct time (patients have an accurate memory of time).
        “Take over medication:” Overdose at the correct time (patients have an accurate memory of time).
        The patient’s medication information was obtained by the attending physician during the follow-up visit. If the patient failed to follow up on time, the information was obtained by telephone.
      
      
        Sample
        A power analysis was performed using the G*Power 3.1.9.7 program (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany) to determine the sample size with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%. Considering a 10% loss to follow-up rate, the minimum sample size for each group was 36.
      
      
        Statistical Analysis
        Normally distributed data are expressed as means (standard deviations), and differences between the groups were analyzed using independent and paired Student’s t-tests. Non-normally distributed data are expressed as medians (IQR) and were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U-test for two-group comparisons. Differences between the two sample rates were analyzed using the chi-square test. According to a previous study,18 we estimated a mean difference of 20–30% in the proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100% between the two groups. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 26; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA), and statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
      
    
    
      Results
      
        Patients
        Of the 79 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 38 were randomly assigned to the medication calendar group and 41 to the control group. Two patients in the medication calendar group were excluded because they did not use the medication calendar as required, resulting in a total of 77 patients. Both groups met the sample size requirements. The male-to-female ratio was 1:2.4 (23 versus [vs] 56), the average age was 51.39 (14.76) years, and the average RA duration was 3.0 (1.00–5.00) years. The patient’s disease activity (DAS28-CRP) was 4.52 (0.84). The proportion of farmers was 37.9%. Over 80% of the patients had completed primary education, and > 75% had one or more underlying diseases. Almost all patients received concomitant medications, including those for other chronic diseases and antirheumatic drugs in addition to methotrexate. No significant differences were observed in the baseline data between the groups (Table 1).Table 1Characteristics of the Study PopulationCalendar (N = 38)Control (N = 41)P-valueAge in years, mean (SD)52.66 (12.07)50.22 (16.94)0.467Sex, n (%)0.331Male9 (23.7)14 (34.1)Female29 (76.3)27 (65.9)Occupation, n (%)0.702Manual worker8 (21.1)12 (29.3)Farmer16 (42.1)14 (34.1)Office worker9 (23.7)7 (17.1)Freelance worker1 (2.6)3 (7.3)Unemployed4 (10.5)5 (12.2)Education level, n (%)0.410Never received education7 (18.4)7 (17.1)Grade school education15 (39.5)11 (26.8)Secondary education10 (26.3)18 (43.9)Higher education6 (15.8)5 (12.2)Duration of rheumatoid arthritis in years, median (IQR)3.0 (1.00–4.25)3.0 (1.00–7.50)0.990DAS28-CRP, mean (SD)4.48(0.77)4.56(0.91)0.662Underlying disease, n (%)0.451No10 (26.3)9 (21.9)1 disease17 (44.7)15 (36.6)2 diseases7 (18.4)7 (17.1)≥ 3 diseases4 (10.5)10 (24.4)Concurrent polypharmacy, n (%)0.8411 chronic medication8 (21.5)9 (22.0)2 chronic medications4 (10.5)6 (14.6)≥ 3 chronic medications26 (68.4)26 (63.4)Concurrent antirheumatic drugs, n (%)0.727No1 (2.6)0 (0.0)1 medication13 (34.2)16 (39.0)2 medications20 (52.6)20 (48.8)≥ 3 medications4 (10.5)5 (12.2)Abbreviations: SD, Standard Deviation; IQR, Interquartile Range.
      
      
        Primary Outcome
        The proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100% in the medication calendar group was significantly higher than that in the control group (97.2% vs 73.2%, P < 0.004). After discontinuing the medication calendar, the proportion was still significantly higher than that in the control group (88.9% vs 68.9%, P < 0.03) but showed a downward trend (Figure 2A).

        Secondary Outcome
        The correct medication adherence rates within 10 weeks were 87.81% in the medication calendar group and 69.00% in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.343; 95% confidence interval, 0.139–0.851; P = 0.0307) (Figure 2B). After 6 weeks, no significant difference was observed in PDC values between the two groups (100.0% [100.0–100.0%] vs 100.0% [95.24–100.0%], P = 0.217). However, higher patient distribution was observed in areas with high PDC values on the violin plot in the medication calendar group than in the control group (Figure 2C). Following the discontinuation of the medication calendar, the distribution of patients began to shift toward lower PDC values (Figure 2C). At each follow-up time point, the correct medication adherence rate was significantly higher in the medication calendar group than in the control group (97.2% vs 75.36%, P < 0.007), particularly at week 2 (100.0% vs 80.0%, P < 0.006) (Figure 2D and Supplementary Table 1). At the other follow-up points (6 and 8 weeks), no significant difference was observed in the administration accuracy between the two groups. During the two follow-up visits when doctors adjusted the dosage, the on-time follow-up rate was higher in the medication calendar group than in the control group (97.2% vs 78.0%, P = 0.016; 91.7% vs 70.7%, P < 0.021) (Figure 3A). During the 10-week period, five patients (13.12%) in the medication calendar group and four (9.76%) in the control group, including one (2.43%) who had drug overdose, experienced adverse reactions (Figure 3B). The only medication error in the medication calendar group was a wrong time error. Other error types were observed only after discontinuation of the medication calendar. The distribution of error types in the control group was similar (Figure 3C and D). At each follow-up time point, there was no significant difference in disease activity between the two groups of patients (Figure 4A). However, when the patient’s sixth-week data were used as a control, the disease activity of patients in the calendar group still decreased significantly at week 10, while the disease activity of patients in the control group did not decrease (Figure 4B).

        Among the 36 participants who used medication calendars, 92.1% believed that the calendar reminded them to take their medications, 94.7% felt it reduced dosage errors, 89.5% found it helpful for scheduling follow-up appointments in advance, 94.7% considered it beneficial for medication management, and 97.3% found it easy to understand. Furthermore, 94.7% of patients in the calendar group believed that the medication calendar improved their adherence and anticipated continued use of the calendar (Figure 4C).
      
    
    
      Discussion
      According to epidemiological data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, by 2021, the age group with the largest number of RA cases in China is expected to be between 50 and 54 years old, with women accounting for a higher proportion than men.19 The age and gender distribution of patients with RA included in this study are consistent with the above results. However, it is worth noting that in terms of occupation, there was a higher proportion of farmers among patients. In another study of palindromic rheumatism by the team, patients with RA as controls also showed a higher proportion of farmers (51.5%).20 Besides the large group of farmers in China itself, the cause of this phenomenon may also be related to the lack of medical resources in the rural areas where farmers live. Farmers often lack an understanding of RA prevention and treatment methods. Humid rural environments and long-term labor may promote the occurrence and progress of RA.21 Furthermore, only a small number of patients in this study received higher education, which also explains why most patients only started to take methotrexate continuously with at least 1 year of RA. Expanding medical resource coverage in rural areas and RA prevention and treatment missions for low-educated farmers may be one of the keys to reducing the burden of RA disease in China.
      In China, the compliance rate of patients with RA ranges from 38.6% to 80.2%. If only the compliance of methotrexate is considered, the compliance rate may be even lower. The main barriers to methotrexate compliance in current studies include adverse reactions and treatment disappointment.10,22 Patients’ concerns about the treatment plan may lead them to stop taking the drug or actively reduce the dose of methotrexate.14 Therefore, patient education programs that increase doctor-patient communication, improve patient knowledge, and reduce the fear of adverse reactions to methotrexate can effectively reduce the proportion of patients with RA who actively stop taking the drug.23–25 However, patients who are willing to take methotrexate face another major barrier to compliance, which is taking the wrong medication. As a “non-daily treatment” (taking the drug only once a week), the phenomenon of missing medication exists in most patients.14,22 Similarly, in this study, only 75.6% of patients in the control group took methotrexate correctly within 2 weeks after the first visit, indicating that without additional intervention, approximately 25% of patients will use methotrexate incorrectly after discharge. What is more noteworthy is that the proportion of patients who unconsciously take less medication was higher than those who miss it. Incorrect use can lead to poor treatment effects of methotrexate, increased incidence of adverse reactions, and even toxic reactions, which in turn lead to patients’ doubts about the treatment plan and fear of adverse reactions, prompting them to stop taking the drug on their initiative. Therefore, how to get patients to take methotrexate correctly is also a key node to improve compliance.
      Regular reminders are one of the effective measures to address unintentional non-adherence. Weekly reminder text messages have been shown to have a positive impact on the adherence of patients with RA taking methotrexate.26 However, some studies have pointed out that reminder text messages have limited effects, and it is difficult to improve the effect of medication reminders alone without the support of medical staff.23,27 Digital interventions, such as Email reminders or online patient portals, can also effectively improve patient compliance when used as medication reminders.28 Unfortunately, in China, the number of people who register for Email accounts and check them regularly is relatively small, especially among older adults. Skilled and active clinical pharmacists can make up for the above limitations,29–32 but the workload and cost of clinical pharmacists conducting multiple education or follow-up visits for each patient need to be considered, especially in China, where there is a shortage of clinical pharmacists. An effective, easier-to-implement, and less costly medication calendar may be a better choice.
      In oncology, caregivers of children with cancer often make mistakes when administering medication in the home setting, including incorrect dosing or frequency and missed doses.33,34 This is very similar to unintentional non-adherence in methotrexate treatment. An effective medication calendar system can encourage patients to take their medication correctly.35 However, standardizing the construction of medication calendars is crucial to limiting its clinical application. The printability of medication calendars and the ability to easily adjust medications and doses are of greatest concern.36 The medication calendar in this study was composed of two components: a calendar and a medication label. Medication labels can be designed to display different medications and doses based on a physician’s medication regimen. When obtaining information, patients preferred pictures to text, and graphic-based medication labels were easier to understand.37,38 An ink layer that could be scraped off by the patient was included to prevent repeated administration of the same medication. The family members of patients in the medication calendar group reported that they used this mark to remind them to take their medications. Once the initial design is completed, the medication calendar can be produced in large quantities without delay and at a low cost.
      The proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100% and the rate of correct medication adherence were used to assess the effect of the medication calendar. The proportion of patients with a PDC value of 100% was significantly higher in the medication calendar group compared to the control group, indicating that the medication calendar improved patient adherence. This finding was further confirmed by the correct medication adherence rates. The difference in medication accuracy between the groups was most pronounced during the first 2 weeks; however, the rates improved thereafter, narrowing the difference. This increase was likely attributed to additional medication education provided by doctors and pharmacists during follow-up visits, which had an effect similar to that of the medication calendar. No significant difference in PDC values between the groups was observed during the period of medication calendar usage, potentially due to the insufficient observation period. However, the control group had a higher proportion of patients with low PDC values compared to the medication calendar group.
      In the control group, patient medication errors were mainly concentrated in “Take less medication”. And “Take over medication”, the most dangerous medication error also occurred in one case. This also confirmed that medication calendars reduced the risk and severity of medication errors. Compared with patients in the control group, those in the medication calendar group had significantly higher on-time follow-up rates at both times.
      However, the benefits of using the medication calendar waned after discontinuation. The PDC values of patients in the medication calendar group also began to trend toward lower PDC values. Moreover, the proportion of patients with 100% PDC decreased. At 4 weeks after discontinuing the medication calendar, medication adherence in both groups began to decline despite further medication education. Dosage errors were also observed in the medication calendar group. This suggests that the benefits of the medication calendar are based on its continued use; nonetheless, errors might have been observed because the medication calendar was not used for sufficient time to have a lasting effect. In this study, the use of methotrexate resulted in a significant decrease in disease activity for both patient groups compared to the baseline; however, no difference was observed between the two groups. The reason for this phenomenon may be that although the proportion of patients in the control group who took methotrexate correctly was lower than that in the drug calendar group, it still accounted for about 70%. The treatment effect of this part of patients masked the difference in disease activity. Secondly, among patients who took it incorrectly, the main type of error was taking less medication, with no active discontinuation of medication. Therefore, methotrexate can still play a specific therapeutic role, narrowing the treatment gap with patients in the drug calendar group. Additionally, as a drug with a slower onset, the effect of taking methotrexate correctly may require a longer follow-up time to be reflected. When the patient’s sixth-week data was used as a control, the disease activity of patients in the calendar group still decreased significantly, while the disease activity of patients in the control group did not decrease significantly. This may be a reflection of the effect of taking methotrexate correctly in the first six weeks. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups. However, one patient in the control group developed severe oral ulcers due to daily oral administration of methotrexate. Toxic reactions to drug overdose are more dangerous than other adverse reactions. In the satisfaction assessment conducted at the end of the study, most patients in the medication calendar group felt that the calendar was effective, concise, and easy to use, and they expressed a desire to continue using it in the future.
      During the medication calendar usage, regardless of whether there was a medication error, patients and their families used the medication calendar to recall the medication process more accurately. In contrast, patients in the control group had ambiguity/uncertainty in recalling medication use, which was also a cause of errors. The medication calendar appears to be an auxiliary tool for improving the accuracy of adherence assessments. This study did not verify this effect to evaluate related outcomes.
      This study had some limitations. First, owing to constraints in funding and personnel, we were unable to recruit a larger number of patients or extend the use of the medication calendar for a longer period. This limitation may have reduced the ability of the medication calendar to help patients develop a consistent habit of taking methotrexate correctly. Second, while the medication calendar helped reduce unintentional medication errors, the study did not include patients with intentionally low adherence—such as those who discontinued medication owing to concerns about side effects or symptom improvement. Third, the medication calendar may increase the likelihood that the patient’s relatives will remind or help more accurately, which may also be one of the mechanisms by which the medication calendar works. However, that will lead to an overestimation of the patient’s medication adherence. We did not intervene in the behavior of the patient’s relatives because this would affect the real-world care mechanism and prevent the patients from seeking support on their own. Since it is impossible to predict which relatives of the patients will assist the patients, this study did not record the educational level of the patient’s relatives. Additionally, the inclusion of patients re-initiating methotrexate after >3 months, while necessary for recruitment feasibility, may introduce unmeasured confounding from prior drug exposure. Although dose titration was restarted and historical details were unavailable, subtle biases related to past efficacy/tolerability experiences cannot be fully excluded. In further research, the study scale will be expanded to include more research centers and sample sizes, the recruitment time will be extended, etc. Additionally, different subgroup analyses will be conducted to minimize the interference of patients’ relatives or explore the impact of previous methotrexate exposure on outcomes.
    
    
      Conclusion
      The antirheumatic medicine calendar improved drug adherence in patients taking methotrexate for the first time, as recognized by the patients. However, this effect was not sustained after the calendar use was discontinued.

Title: Epidemiology of Skin Diseases in Poland: Analysis of Prevalence and Risk Factors: A Cross-Sectional Study

Abstract: IntroductionAlthough skin diseases are a significant public health concern, epidemiological data for Poland is still lacking. This study aimed to fill this scientific gap by analyzing the prevalence of skin diseases and associated risk factors in the Polish population.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the National Healthy Skin Test (2023), an online questionnaire distributed via the Medonet health platform, involving 27,000 adult Polish internet users. Participants self-reported physician-diagnosed skin conditions. The prevalence of these conditions was assessed, and statistical analysis, including logistic regression, was used to evaluate associations with demographic and socioeconomic factors (age, gender, education level, and urbanization).ResultsThe most prevalent skin conditions were herpes labialis (40.6%), dandruff (37.6%), hair loss (34.8%), and acne (32.7%), with 89.5% of participants reporting at least one condition. Striking gender differences were observed, with psoriasis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.10, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.80–2.30) and tinea pedis (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.90–2.30) in men, while women were more prone to rosacea (OR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.50–0.70) and hair loss (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.60–0.70). Higher education was unexpectedly associated with an increased risk of multiple conditions, including acne (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.40–1.60) and non-melanoma skin cancer (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.20–1.80), but a decreased risk of psoriasis (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00). Urban residents of cities with > 500,000 inhabitants showed a significantly higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis/eczema (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00–1.30) and non-melanoma skin cancer (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.40–2.90) compared with other areas.ConclusionsThis first overview of skin disease epidemiology in Poland reveals significant variations in prevalence based on demographic and socioeconomic factors. These findings have important public health implications, suggesting the need for: (1) gender-specific dermatological education campaigns, (2) age-targeted skin cancer screening programs for those over 65 years, (3) improved access to dermatological care in rural areas, and (4) educational interventions addressing the observed socioeconomic disparities in disease prevalence and detection.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13555-025-01464-5.

Body: Key Summary Points
      
Why carry out this study?Skin diseases pose a significant public health concern in Poland, but national epidemiological data, particularly on a wide range of conditions and their specific sociodemographic correlates, have been limited.Understanding Poland-specific skin disease prevalence and associated risk factors is crucial for tailoring national public health strategies, allocating healthcare resources, and identifying vulnerable populations.This study aimed to determine the self-reported lifetime prevalence of 20 common skin conditions and their associations with key demographic (age, gender) and socioeconomic (education, urbanization) factors in a large sample of adult Polish internet users.What was learned from this study?Among 27,000 adult Polish internet users, 89.5% reported at least one physician-diagnosed skin condition: the most prevalent were herpes labialis (40.6%), dandruff (37.6%), hair loss (34.8%), and acne (32.7%). Significant variations by gender, age, education, and urbanization were identified.Adjusted analyses revealed important risk associations: for instance, men had higher odds of psoriasis (rdds ratio [OR] = 2.00) and tinea pedis (OR = 2.00), while higher education was unexpectedly associated with increased odds of acne (OR = 1.50) and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC; OR = 1.40), but decreased odds of psoriasis (OR = 0.90). Residents of large cities (> 500,000) had higher odds of atopic dermatitis/eczema (OR = 1.20) and NMSC (OR = 2.00).The study provides valuable initial insights into the dermatological landscape within a large sample of Polish internet users, highlighting a substantial self-perceived burden and distinct demographic/socioeconomic patterns that can inform hypotheses for future population-representative research and suggest potential areas for targeted public health awareness.The findings, particularly the high prevalence and specific risk associations (e.g., gender differences, links with education and urbanization), underscore the potential need for tailored dermatological education, screening programs (like for NMSC in older urban populations), and strategies to address care access disparities, pending confirmation in broader, representative Polish population samples.
    
    
      Introduction
      Skin diseases represent a significant burden on healthcare systems, both due to their relatively high prevalence and the impact on the quality of life of those affected [1, 2]. This diverse group of conditions includes both chronic and acute diseases, ranging from very common to extremely rare. Although largely non-fatal, skin diseases contribute to a deterioration in patients’ functioning, posing physical, mental, and financial burdens. Numerous studies have demonstrated that dermatological conditions such as atopic dermatitis [3], psoriasis [4], and acne [5] significantly impair various aspects of patients’ quality of life, particularly in psychological and social domains [6, 7].
      Among oncological conditions, skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the USA, posing a notable challenge to public health [8]. Its more prevalent form, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), is characterized by slow growth and a low tendency to metastasize. In contrast, melanoma, though rarer, is more malignant and has higher mortality rates. In both cases, early detection is crucial for prognosis, underscoring the importance of understanding the epidemiology of these cancers.
      Skin diseases place a considerable strain on primary healthcare resources, being a common reason for consultations with general practitioners [9, 10]. In Poland, visits to dermatology clinics accounted for 5.6% of all outpatient visits in the public health sector in 2022, ranking them sixth among all specialty clinics [11].
      There are numerous studies in scientific literature addressing the epidemiology of skin diseases worldwide. Among the most significant is the comprehensive “global skin disease morbidity and mortality: an update from the Global Burden of Disease Study”, which summarizes data from over 4000 sources and ranks skin diseases as the fourth leading cause of nonfatal disease burden [2]. More recently, a large-scale population-based study in 2022 examined the prevalence of common skin diseases across 27 European countries, including Poland, highlighting their widespread occurrence [1]. However, while such multinational studies provide valuable overarching insights, detailed national-level data, particularly concerning a range of conditions and their specific sociodemographic risk factors within Poland, are still lacking. Country-specific epidemiological features can be influenced by unique demographic profiles, genetic predispositions, environmental exposures, lifestyle factors, and variations in healthcare system access and reporting, which may not be fully captured in broader European analyses. Furthermore, understanding the nuances of skin disease prevalence and its correlates within the Polish population is crucial for tailoring national public health strategies, allocating healthcare resources effectively, and identifying specific vulnerable groups. Thus, there is an unmet need for a dedicated epidemiological investigation of skin diseases in Poland.
      Therefore, this study aimed to determine the self-reported lifetime prevalence of a range of 20 common skin conditions within a large sample of the adult Polish internet-using population. A further primary objective was to identify and quantify the associations between the occurrence of these skin conditions and key demographic factors, namely age and gender, as well as socioeconomic factors, including education level and degree of urbanization. We hypothesized that prevalence would vary significantly across these different demographic and socioeconomic subgroups, potentially highlighting areas for targeted public health interventions. Ultimately, the findings are intended to contribute to a better understanding of the dermatological burden in Poland and inform healthcare resource management.
    
    
      Methods
      
        Study Design and Setting
        A national cross-sectional study design was employed to investigate the prevalence of skin diseases and associated risk factors in Poland. Data were collected as part of the “National Healthy Skin Test,” an online survey conducted in Poland throughout 2023. The questionnaire was administered electronically via Medonet (Ringier Axel Springer Poland), a major Polish health-oriented internet portal with a broad user base.
      
      
        Study Population and Recruitment
        Participants were adult (≥ 18 years) Polish internet users who voluntarily accessed and completed the online questionnaire on the Medonet platform. No specific exclusion criteria were applied beyond the age requirement and the necessity of internet access to participate. The recruitment strategy employed a convenience sampling method. Potential participants were primarily invited through prominent banner advertisements and direct links featured on the Onet.pl homepage. Similar access was provided via banner advertisements and a dedicated landing page for the “National Healthy Skin Test” on the Medonet.pl homepage. Furthermore, links directing to the survey were embedded within relevant health-focused articles published on the Medonet.pl portal. It is important to note that email invitations were not used as a recruitment channel for this study.
        An initial total of 30,417 questionnaires were collected. Subsequently, these responses underwent data quality validation and cleaning procedures, which were conducted by a professional research agency specializing in market and social research. This process resulted in a final analytical sample of 27,000 valid responses. The validation and cleaning procedures involved thorough checks for the completeness of key variables, the identification and removal of likely duplicate entries on the basis of response patterns and submission timestamps, and the exclusion of responses that were overtly inconsistent or contained nonsensical answers. In adherence to data privacy considerations regarding sensitive health information, IP addresses were not collected or utilized in any part of the deduplication process.
      
      
        Data Collection and Variables
        Data were collected using a self-administered online questionnaire developed in Polish (an English translation of the relevant questions is provided in Supplementary Table S1).
        Outcome variables (skin conditions):: The primary outcomes were the self-reported lifetime prevalence of various skin conditions. Participants were asked: “Have you ever been diagnosed by a physician with any of the following dermatological conditions affecting the skin, hair, or nails?” This question was followed by a list of 22 specific conditions or categories from which participants could make multiple selections (see Supplementary Table S1). These questionnaire items were: acne, androgenic hair loss, atopic dermatitis, dandruff, eczema, fungal skin infection, furuncle, hair loss (cause unknown/not androgenic), herpes labialis, melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), pemphigus/pemphigoid, psoriasis, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, tinea pedis, tinea unguium, viral warts, vitiligo, other bacterial or viral skin infection, other hair or nail disease, and other skin disease. These items were selected on the basis of their reported clinical prevalence in dermatological practice and their public health significance in Poland, aiming for an overview of common dermatological issues.
        For the purpose of analysis and reporting, two pairs of these questionnaire items were combined owing to their clinical similarity and common interchangeable use in lay and sometimes clinical contexts, resulting in 20 final condition categories: (1) “atopic dermatitis” and “eczema” were combined into a single category: “atopic dermatitis/eczema,” and (2) “androgenic hair loss” and “hair loss (cause unknown/not androgenic)” were combined into a general category: “hair loss.” The remaining 18 items were analyzed as distinct categories.
        Regarding specific terms used in the questionnaire: “non-melanoma skin cancer” was presented as such, and participant understanding relied on their recall of a prior physician diagnosis. “Dandruff” was included owing to its common self-recognition and high reported frequency in the population, acknowledging that this lay term may encompass mild forms of seborrheic dermatitis or other pityriasiform scalp conditions. The categories “other hair or nail disease” and “other skin disease” were provided to allow for the reporting of any diagnosed conditions not explicitly listed. The reliance on self-reported physician diagnoses for ascertaining skin conditions is a methodological aspect whose implications are further addressed in the limitations section of this paper.
        Exposure variables (demographic and socioeconomic factors): Participants also provided information on several demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Age was reported directly by participants and subsequently categorized for analysis into the following groups: 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, and 65+ years. Gender was self-reported with options for “male,” “female,” or “other.” Educational level was categorized on the basis of the Polish education system as “primary and vocational,” “secondary and post-secondary,” or “higher education.” The place of residence, used as a proxy for the degree of urbanization, was categorized on the basis of population size as follows: “countryside,” “city up to 19,000 citizens,” “city of 20,000–49,000 citizens,” “city of 50,000–99,000 citizens,” “city of 100,000–199,000 citizens,” “city of 200,000–499,000 citizens,” and “city of 500,000 and more citizens.”
      
      
        Study Size Justification
        To estimate an appropriate minimum sample size for determining prevalence with reasonable precision, standard calculations were performed. Assuming a 95% confidence interval (CI) (corresponding to a Z-value of 1.96), a margin of error (E) of ± 3% (0.03), and, to maximize sample size requirements in the absence of prior Polish estimates for all conditions, an anticipated population proportion (p) of skin conditions of 50% (0.5), the formula n = Z2p(1 − p)/E2 indicated a minimum requirement of n = 1068 individuals. The achieved final sample size of n = 27,000 participants considerably exceeds this minimum, thereby providing robust statistical power for the planned descriptive and analytical components of the study.
      
      
        Ethical Approval and Consent to Participate
        This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1964 and its later amendments). The research protocol for this survey-based study, which involved the collection of anonymized data and voluntary participation, was reviewed by the Bioethics Committee of the Military Chamber of Physicians (Wojskowa Izba Lekarska) in Warsaw, Poland. The committee determined that formal ethical approval was not required for this type of study, given its anonymized and voluntary nature (decision no. KB 65/2024).
        All participants were adult (≥ 18 years) internet users. Prior to commencing the online questionnaire, all individuals were fully informed about the study’s objectives, the nature of the data to be collected, and data handling procedures. Participation was entirely voluntary and anonymous, and no compensation was offered. Online informed consent to participate was obtained from all participants before they could proceed with the survey. As all data were collected and analyzed anonymously, specific consent to publish individual data was not applicable as no identifiable information is included in this paper.
      
      
        Statistical Analyses
        All statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 13.5 (1984–2017 TIBCO Software Inc, Palo Alto, California, USA) and MS Excel software. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests.
        Descriptive statistics, including frequencies (n) and percentages (%), were used to summarize the demographic characteristics of the study sample and the prevalence of each skin condition. To assess differences in the prevalence of skin diseases on the basis of gender, age category, education level, and urbanization category, bivariate chi-squared tests (test of independence) were utilized. For direct comparisons of skin disease occurrence by gender, odds ratios (OR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated, using females as the reference group.
        To further investigate associations and control for potential confounding, multivariable logistic regression models were implemented separately for each skin disease as the dependent variable (coded as 0 for absence and 1 for presence of the self-reported diagnosed condition). The independent variables (predictors) included in these models were gender (reference: female), age category (reference: 45–54 years), education level (reference: secondary and post-secondary education), and degree of urbanization (reference: city of 50,000–99,000 inhabitants). These reference categories were chosen as they generally represented common or substantial segments within our sample. For each model, odds ratios (OR) and their 95% CIs were calculated for each category of the independent variables relative to these reference levels. Regression coefficients (β) and their statistical significance were also determined for each predictor.
        The final analyses were conducted on participants with complete data for the variables included in each specific model. Participants with missing data for any variable included in a specific logistic regression model were excluded from that particular analysis.
        In addition to the main analyses, gender-stratified analyses were performed to explore the prevalence of skin conditions by age, education, and urbanization separately for males and females. Given the non-probabilistic, convenience sampling method inherent in this online voluntary survey, statistical inferences regarding the broader Polish population are made with caution, a point elaborated upon in the Discussion. No specific sensitivity analyses beyond the stratified analyses were pre-planned or conducted for this study.
      
    
    
      Results
      
        Demographic Characteristics
        The study sample comprised 27,000 participants, with a notable majority of females (22,043; 81.7%) compared with males (4887; 18.1%); 70 participants (0.3%) identified their gender as “other.” The largest age groups within the sample were 35–44 years (6312 participants; 23.4%) and 45–54 years (6396 participants; 23.7%). Most participants reported having higher education (14,637; 54.2%), followed by secondary or post-secondary education (9935; 36.8%).

        Regarding place of residence, 5487 participants (20.3%) lived in rural areas, and 5563 (20.6%) resided in large cities with over 500,000 inhabitants. Cities with populations between 20,000 and 49,000 inhabitants were home to 4137 participants (15.3%). The distribution across other urbanization categories is detailed in Table 1.
      
      
        Prevalence of Skin Diseases
        A significant portion of respondents (89.5%) reported at least one of the listed diseases, with a similar prevalence among women and men. Age-related differences were observed: individuals aged 18–44 showed a statistically significant excess of those reporting at least one disease. Educational attainment and place of residence also influenced reporting patterns. Higher education was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting at least one disease compared with those with lower, vocational, or secondary education. Moreover, residents of cities with populations exceeding 200,000 exhibited a statistically significant excess of individuals reporting at least one skin disease. Table 2 shows the percentage structure of participants who declared at least one disease.Table 2Percentage structure of participants who declared any disease [the numbers (n) and frequencies (%) of the occurrences of skin diseases among study sample; total: 27,000)Disease occurrenceYesNoDifference significanceTotal24,161 (89.5)2839 (10.5)χ2 = 16,838.06;df = 1;p < 0.001Genderχ2 = 0.24;df = 2;p = 0.8875 Men4364 (16.2)523 (1.9) Women19,734 (73.1)2309 (8.3) Other63 (0.2)7 (0.03)Age categoryχ2 = 237.73;df = 5;p < 0.001 18–24894 (3.3)61 (0.2) 25–343479 (12.9)249 (0.9) 35–445815 (21.5)497 (1.8) 45–545695 (21.1)701 (2.6) 55–643904 (14.5)618 (2.3)65 + 4374 (16.2)713 (2.6)Educationχ2 = 178.92;df = 2;p < 0.001 Primary and vocational2041 (7.6)387 (1.4) Secondary8713 (32.3)1222 (4.5) Higher13,407 (49.7)1230 (4.6)Urbanizationχ2 = 28.75;df = 6;p < 0.001 Countryside4875 (18.1)612 (2.3) City up to 19,000 citizens2758 (10.2)332 (1.2) City of 20,000–49,000 citizens3652 (13.5)485 (1.8) City of 50,000–99,000 citizens2621 (9.7)326 (1.2) City of 100,000–199,000 citizens2445 (9.1)295 (1.1) City of 200,000–499,000 citizens2737 (10.1)299 (1.1) City of 500,000+ citizens5073 (18.8)490 (1.8)
        Within the study sample, herpes labialis was the most prevalent condition, affecting 40.6% of participants, followed by dandruff and hair loss reported by 37.6% and 34.8% of respondents, respectively. Acne impacted 32.7% of those surveyed. Other common conditions included atopic dermatitis/eczema (25.5%), viral warts (20.2%), and tinea unguium (17.6%). Among potentially life-threatening skin diseases, melanoma was found in 1.1% of cases, while NMSC affected 1.7%.
      
      
        Gender Differences
        Gender-specific analysis revealed a similar set of prevalent diseases in both sexes, in differing orders of frequency. In males, the most common condition was dandruff (48.3%), followed by acne (32.9%), herpes labialis (31.6%), atopic dermatitis/eczema (27.5%), hair loss (27.1%), tinea unguium (20.0%), and viral warts (19.8%, Table 3).Table 3Prevalence of skin diseases stratified by gender [the numbers (n) and frequencies (%) of the occurrences of skin diseases among study sample; total: 27,000)TraitMalesFemalesOtherAllMale versus female difference significanceOR[−95% CI: +95% CI]Acneχ2 = 0.1df = 1p = 0.75541.0[1.0:1.1]Yes1606 (32.9)7193 (32.6)34 (48.6)8833 (32.7)No3281 (67.1)14,850 (67.4)36 (51.4)18,167 (67.3)Atopic dermatitis/eczemaχ2 = 12.72df = 1p < 0.0011.1[1.1:1.2]Yes1343 (27.5)5516 (25.0)27 (38.6)6886 (25.5)No3544 (72.5)16,527 (75.0)43 (61.4)20,114 (74.5)Dandruffχ2 = 290.93df = 1p < 0.0011.7[1.6:1.8]Yes2358 (48.3)7757 (35.2)36 (51.4)10,151 (37.6)No2529 (51.8)14,286 (64.8)34 (48.6)16,849 (62.4)Fungal skin infectionχ2 = 97.58df = 1p < 0.0011.7[1.6:2.0]Yes462 (9.5)1245 (5.7)8 (11.4)1715 (6.4)No4425 (90.6)20,798 (94.4)62 (88.6)25,285 (93.7)Furuncleχ2 = 54.28df = 1p < 0.0011.4[1.3:1.5]Yes705 (14.4)2364 (10.7)15 (21.4)3084 (11.4)No4182 (85.6)19,679 (89.3)55 (78.6)23,916 (88.6)Hair lossχ2 = 154.38df = 1p < 0.0010.6[0.6:0.7]Yes1324 (27.1)8034 (36.4)27 (38.6)9385 (34.8)No3563 (72.9)14,009 (63.6)43 (61.4)17,615 (65.2)Herpes labialisχ2 = 202.53df = 1p < 0.0010.6[0.6:0.7]Yes1542 (31.6)9391 (42.6)35 (50.0)10,968 (40.6)No3345 (68.5)12,652 (57.4)35 (50.0)16,032 (59.4)Melanomaχ2 = 17.7df = 1p < 0.0011.7[1.3:2.2]Yes81 (1.66)213 (1.0)2 (2.9)296 (1.1)No4806 (98.3)21,830 (99.0)68 (97.1)26,704 (98.9)Non-melanoma skin cancerχ2 = 21.72df = 1p < 0.0011.6[1.3:2.0]Yes121 (2.5)336 (1.5)2 (2.9)459 (1.7)No4766 (97.5)21,707 (98.5)68 (97.1)26,541 (98.3)Pemphigus/pemphigoidχ2 = 6.59df = 1p = 0.01031.7[1.1:2.6]Yes31 (0.6)82 (0.4)2 (2.9)115 (0.4)No4856 (99.4)21,961 (99.6)68 (97.1)26,885 (99.6)Psoriasisχ2 = 156.18df = 1p < 0.0012.1[1.8:2.3]Yes453 (9.27)1045 (4.74)5 (7.1)1503 (5.0)No4434 (90.73)20,998 (95.26)65 (92.9)25,497 (94.4)Rosaceaχ2 = 77.78df = 1p < 0.0010.6[0.5:0.7]Yes356 (7.3)2561 (11.6)13 (18.6)2930 (10.9)No4531 (92.7)19,482 (88.4)57 (81.4)24,070 (89.2)Seborrheic dermatitisχ2 = 116.6df = 1p < 0.0011.7[1.5:1.8]Yes691 (14.14)1990 (9.0)10 (14.3)2691 (10.0)No4196 (85.86)20,053 (91.0)60 (85.7)24,309 (90.0)Tinea pedisχ2 = 278.4df = 1p < 0.0012.1[1.9:2.3]Yes852 (17.4)2042 (9.3)9 (12.9)2903 (10.8)No4035 (82.6)20,001 (90.7)61 (87.1)24,097 (89.3)Tinea unguiumχ2 = 22.13df = 1p < 0.0011.2[1.1:1.3]Yes975 (20.0)3773 (17.1)10 (143)4758 (17.6)No3912 (80.1)18,270 (82.9)60 (85.7)22,242 (82.4)Viral wartsχ2 = 0.6df = 1p = 0.43881.0[0.9:1.1]Yes967 (19.8)4470 (20.3)14 (20.0)5451 (20.2)No3920 (80.2)17,573 (79.7)56 (80.0)21,549 (79.8)Vitiligoχ2 = 8.1df = 1p = 0.00441.3[1.1:1.6]Yes148 (3.0)514 (2.3)6 (8.6)668 (2.5)No4739 (97.0)21,529 (97.7)64 (91.4)26,332 (97.5)Other bacterial or viral skin infectionχ2 = 10.25df = 1p = 0.00141.2[1.1:1.3]Yes555 (11.4)2167 (9.8)16 (22.9)2738 (10.1)No4332 (88.6)19,876 (90.2)54 (77.1)24,262 (89.9)Other hair or nail diseaseχ2 = 12.68df = 1p < 0.0010.7[0.6:0.9]Yes163 (3.3)986 (4.5)6 (8.6)1155 (4.3)No4724 (96.7)21,057 (95.5)64 (91.4)25,845 (95.7)Other skin diseaseχ2 = 16.99df = 1p < 0.0011.3[1.1:1.4]Yes450 (9.2)1645 (7.5)13 (18.6)2108 (7.8)No4437 (90.8)20,398 (92.5)57 (81.5)24,892 (92.2)
        In females, the most common condition was herpes labialis (42.6%), followed by hair loss (36.4%), dandruff (35.2%), acne (32.6%), atopic dermatitis/eczema (25.0%), viral warts (20.3%), and tinea unguium (17.1%, Table 3).
        Analysis of gender influence revealed significant disparities in the prevalence of most skin conditions. Men were approximately two times more likely to experience tinea pedis (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.90–2.30) and psoriasis (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.80–2.30). They also showed substantially higher odds of fungal skin infection (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.60–2.00), dandruff (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.60–1.80), pemphigus/pemphigoid (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.10–2.60), melanoma (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.30–2.20), seborrhoeic dermatitis (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.70–1.80), and NMSC (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.34–2.02). In contrast, women had a higher likelihood of exhibiting rosacea (male versus female OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.50–0.70), herpes labialis (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.60–0.70), and hair loss (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.60–0.70). Logistic regression models additionally revealed an increased likelihood of developing acne, atopic dermatitis/eczema, vitiligo, furuncle, and tinea unguium in men, while female gender was associated with a higher probability of viral warts and hair loss (Supplementary Table S5).
      
      
        Age-Related Patterns
        When examining age-related differences in the occurrence of skin diseases collectively (without gender stratification) statistically significant differences were observed across all studied areas. Acne prevalence was highest in younger age cohorts (18–24 years old: 59.9%) and decreased with advancing age (> 65 years old: 12.8%, Supplementary Table S6). Furthermore, atopic dermatitis/eczema was observed in the 18–24 years age group (31.9%), with a decreasing frequency in subsequent age groups from 25 years onward (> 65 years old, 20.1%). The same tendency was also observed among individuals dealing with dandruff (53.0% among those aged 18–24 years versus 25.9% among participants older than 65 years old). In contrast, the number of participants with psoriasis, vitiligo, furuncle, melanoma, NMSC, pemphigus/pemphigoid, tinea pedis, viral warts, and other hair or nail disease increased with age (Supplementary Table S6).
        Individuals aged 18–24 years old were approximately four times more likely to have acne (OR = 3.7, 95% CI: 3.2–4.3, Supplementary Fig. S1A) and almost twice likely to have dandruff (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.7–2.1, Supplementary Fig. S1B) compared with the 45–54 year age group. In contrast, adults older than 65 years were over three times more likely to have skin cancer (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 2.7–4.6) than their younger counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
        To delineate the association between gender and different group ages and exhibited skin diseases, we separated the total sample into males and females and examined the likelihood to exhibit tested skin diseases. Among male participants, an increasing tendency with age was observed among individuals suffering from psoriasis (4.7% in the group aged 18–24 years versus 11.1% in participants aged more than 65 years old), vitiligo (1.16% versus 3.1% for those aged 18–24 years old and more than 65 years old, respectively), furuncle (4.7% for participants between 18 and 24 years old versus 19.8% for those aged > 65 years old), and NMSC (74 participants aged more than 65 years old reported NMSC, while no participant aged 18–24 years old reported this disease). Furthermore, the number of participants exhibiting pemphigus/pemphigoid, tinea unguium, tinea pedis, viral warts, and hair loss increased with age. In contrast, the exceptional decreasing tendency with age was observed among males with acne; older participants were less likely to have acne, as compared with their younger counterparts (54.7% among participants aged 18–24 years old versus 16.7% among participants aged more than 65 years old; Supplementary Table S2). Women showed very similar results, showing the decreasing tendency of acne with age (59.9% of women aged 18–24 years old versus 12.8% of women older than 65 years; Supplementary Table S2), while a significant age-dependent increase in prevalence was observed for conditions including psoriasis, vitiligo, furuncle, NMSC, pemphigus/pemphigoid, tinea unguium, tinea pedis, and viral warts. Gender-specific analysis revealed distinctive patterns: female subjects demonstrated a positive correlation between age and melanoma incidence, as well as an inverse correlation with atopic dermatitis/eczema prevalence—patterns not observed in the male cohort. In addition, unlike their male counterparts, female subjects showed no significant age-associated increase in the prevalence of hair loss.
      
      
        Education Level
        In the analyzed sample, hair loss, dandruff, and acne were the most common diseases regardless of education level. Analyzing the data collectively regardless of gender, as well as examining women and men separately, the diseases that occurred statistically more frequently in individuals with higher education were: acne, seborrhoeic dermatitis, fungal skin infection, herpes labialis, dandruff, atopic dermatitis/eczema, viral warts, rosacea, and other bacterial or viral skin infections. Psoriasis and melanoma were most common in individuals with primary and vocational education. An interesting phenomenon was that hair loss occurred most frequently in men with higher education, while in women it was most common with primary and vocational education (Supplementary Table S3).
        On the basis of logistic regression models, higher education was associated with increased risk of several skin conditions (compared with secondary and post-secondary education), including acne (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.40–1.60, Supplementary Fig. S1A), seborrheic dermatitis (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.10–1.30), fungal skin infection (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.20–1.40), herpes labialis (OR = 1.30 95% CI: 1.20–1.30), furuncle (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.20–1.40), NMSC (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.20–1.80, Supplementary Fig. S1C), other bacterial or viral skin infection (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.10–1.30), tinea pedis (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00–1.20), dandruff (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.10–1.20, Supplementary Fig. S1B), viral warts (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.30–1.50), and other skin disease (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00–1.20, Supplementary Table S2). Respondents with higher education were less likely to suffer from psoriasis (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00) and tinea unguium (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00, Supplementary Table S3; Supplementary Fig. S2).
        Lower education was associated with an increased risk of melanoma (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.00–2.10) and tinea pedis (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00–1.30), and with a lower prevalence of diseases such as acne (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.60–0.80), herpes labialis (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.70–0.80), furuncle (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.90), skin cancer other than melanoma (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.40–1.00), and viral warts (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00).
      
      
        Urbanization
        Across all categories of place of residence, the most common diseases were dandruff, acne, herpes labialis, and hair loss (Supplementary Table S8).
        Although the frequency of many conditions varied significantly depending on the place of residence, logistic regression models demonstrated that urbanization influenced the occurrence of only a few of the studied skin diseases. Residents of large cities (> 500,000 inhabitants) showed higher likelihood of certain skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis/eczema (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00–1.30, Supplementary Fig. S3A) and NMSC (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.40–2.90, Supplementary Fig. S1C). Consistently, rural residents had lower odds of some conditions, such as atopic dermatitis/eczema (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00, Supplementary Fig. S3A), seborrheic dermatitis (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.90, Supplementary Fig. S3B), and viral warts (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00, Supplementary Fig. S3C, Supplementary Table S2). The frequency of the studied skin diseases depending on urbanization with gender stratification is presented in Supplementary Table S4.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      This large-scale cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of common self-reported physician-diagnosed skin conditions and their associated risk factors among adult internet users in Poland. Our findings indicate a high overall burden of skin conditions, with 89.5% of the 27,000 participants reporting at least one condition. The most prevalent were herpes labialis (40.6%), dandruff (37.6%), hair loss (34.8%), and acne (32.7%). Consistent with our primary objectives and initial hypothesis, significant variations in prevalence were observed on the basis of gender, age, education level, and urbanization, highlighting specific demographic and socioeconomic correlates for various dermatological diseases within this sample.
      This study provides valuable insights into the prevalence and distribution of skin diseases among a large sample of 27,000 participants in Poland. Our findings reveal significant patterns in the occurrence of various skin conditions, highlighting important demographic factors that influence their prevalence within this group. Our results indicate that skin diseases are remarkably common, with 89.5% of participants reporting at least one skin condition. This percentage is significantly higher than that obtained from the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) survey in 2022, which reported 43.35% [1]. However, as noted in our methods, it is important to note that the EADV study inquired about the presence of disease within the past 12 months and employed a different sampling strategy across multiple countries, whereas our research focused on lifetime occurrence within a specific online Polish sample. The high reported lifetime prevalence we observed in our specific cohort emphasizes the potential scale of dermatological concerns and the ongoing significance of dermatological care in health management in Poland, though direct comparisons require caution owing to methodological differences.
      The widespread occurrence of self-reported physician-diagnosed herpes labialis (40.6%), dandruff (37.6%), hair loss (34.8%), and acne vulgaris (32.7%) across the entire study sample underscores the significant reported burden of these conditions among Polish internet users participating in this survey. While direct comparisons are challenging due to methodological differences (e.g., lifetime versus point or period prevalence, case definitions, and study populations), these figures can be contextualized with broader epidemiological data. For example, the lifetime prevalence of acne (32.7%) in our predominantly adult online sample appears higher than the global point prevalence of acne vulgaris, estimated at 9.4% by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study, which reported 231.2 million prevalent cases worldwide in that year [16]. However, some studies focusing on lifetime exposure to acne have reported figures ranging from 57.8% to 73.3% in different populations [17], suggesting that a significant portion of the population experiences acne at some point. A recent large-scale German claims data study by Kirsten et al. (2021) found an administrative point prevalence of acne in adults (> 25 years) of 1.50% and in adolescents (≤ 25 years) of 3.88% in 2020 [18], figures much lower than our lifetime self-report but reflecting actively managed cases in a healthcare system.
      Regarding herpes labialis, our reported lifetime prevalence of 40.6% among Polish internet users can be compared with a 2021 meta-analysis by Roy et al., which included 12 European studies and found a pooled prevalence of recurrent herpes labialis (RHL) in European adults of 13% [19]. The higher figure in our study is likely influenced by the lifetime recall period for any physician-diagnosed episode, compared with studies often assessing more recent or recurrent episodes, and the specific characteristics of our self-selected online sample. Nevertheless, both our findings and these broader studies indicate that acne and herpes labialis are highly common conditions. Dandruff and nonspecific hair loss, while highly prevalent in our sample, are more challenging to compare directly with robust epidemiological literature due to varying definitions and often being self-managed conditions.
      The prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosed melanoma (1.1%), a potentially life-threatening skin disease, and NMSC (1.7%), which although rarely life-threatening still requires medical attention, represents a considerable number of reported cases given the large sample size. These figures underline the importance of ongoing public health initiatives for skin cancer awareness and prevention. However, the unexpectedly high ratio of reported melanoma to NMSC in our findings (approximately 1:1.5 compared with the expected 1:18–20 in European cancer registries) strongly suggests a significant potential for respondent misclassification rather than a true epidemiological pattern within our dataset. This observation is a key limitation concerning the validity of self-reported cancer diagnoses in survey research. Highlighting the need for improved public education about different types of skin cancers and their characteristics is crucial, even when individuals recall a physician diagnosis. It is noteworthy that NMSCs, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), represent a significant and increasing global burden, particularly among older adults, as detailed in analyses of the Global Burden of Disease Study [25]. The study by Pan et al. (2025) highlights substantial increases in the incidence of both BCC (291.85% increase in cases globally for older adults, 1990–2021) and SCC (322.77% increase in cases globally for older adults, 1990–2021), underscoring the public health importance of accurately tracking these conditions.
      Our study revealed significant gender-based differences in the prevalence of various skin conditions within our sample. Men showed higher odds for several diseases, including seborrheic dermatitis (OR = 1.70), psoriasis (OR = 2.10), dandruff (OR = 1.70), fungal skin infections (OR = 1.70), melanoma (OR = 1.70), and NMSC (OR = 1.60), after adjustment for other factors (Supplementary Table S5). These findings regarding psoriasis and fungal infections are consistent with current scientific knowledge on this subject [20, 21]. This male predisposition to certain skin conditions could be attributed to various factors such as hormonal differences, lifestyle habits, or occupational exposures [22].
      Conversely, women in our sample exhibited higher odds for conditions such as herpes labialis (OR = 0.60 for males versus females) and rosacea (OR = 0.60 for males versus females). The increased prevalence of herpes labialis in women (42.6% versus 31.6% in men) is particularly noteworthy and may warrant further investigation into potential contributing factors, such as hormonal influences or differences in healthcare-seeking behavior [22].
      Interestingly, the multivariate analysis, which accounted for age, place of residence, and education, revealed some discrepancies with crude univariate associations. For instance, the higher frequency of acne and atopic dermatitis/eczema in males observed in the multivariate analysis (Supplementary Table S5) suggests that these conditions may be influenced by complex interactions between gender and other demographic factors when these factors are considered simultaneously.
      The age-related patterns observed in our study provide valuable insights into the lifecycle of various skin conditions as reported by our participants. The decreasing prevalence of acne with age aligns with the well-established understanding of acne as a condition predominantly affecting younger individuals [14]. Similarly, the higher reported prevalence of atopic dermatitis/eczema in younger age groups corroborates existing literature on the typical onset and course of this condition [23]. The increasing prevalence of conditions such as psoriasis and NMSC with age highlights the cumulative nature of these diseases and the potential role of long-term environmental exposures or age-related changes in skin physiology [24, 26]. A recent scoping review by Kottner et al. (2024) focusing on community-living older people (≥ 60 years) also identified sun exposure and age-related skin conditions such as actinic keratoses, xerosis cutis, neoplasms (including NMSCs), and inflammatory diseases as highly frequent [30]. For instance, the prevalence of NMSC in our > 65 years group (4.0%) falls within the broad ranges (0.4–6.9% for NMSC) summarized by Kottner et al. from various studies in older populations. Similarly, our finding of psoriasis prevalence increasing to 7.9% in the > 65 years group can be contextualized with the 0.5–14.8% range for psoriasis reported in their review for older adults. These findings underscore the importance of age-specific preventive measures and screenings for skin diseases, should these trends be confirmed in the general population.
      The association between higher education and an increased self-reported risk of skin conditions, including acne, seborrheic dermatitis, and various infections, is an intriguing finding from our specific sample. This correlation could be attributed to several factors including increased awareness and health-seeking behavior among more educated individuals, leading to higher rates of diagnosis and reporting which might not necessarily reflect a true higher incidence but rather better case ascertainment in this subgroup [27]. Conversely, the lower reported prevalence of psoriasis and tinea unguium among those with higher education suggests that the relationship between education and skin health is complex and condition-specific.
      The complex relationship between educational attainment and skin disease prevalence observed in our study warrants nuanced interpretation. Rather than suggesting direct causality, these associations within our internet-using sample likely reflect a constellation of interconnected factors. Higher reporting of conditions such as acne, seborrheic dermatitis, and fungal infections among those with higher education likely stems from a combination of increased health literacy, greater awareness of dermatological conditions, enhanced access to healthcare services, and potentially different healthcare-seeking behaviors. Conversely, the higher reported prevalence of psoriasis and tinea unguium among those with lower educational attainment may reflect differing occupational exposures, lifestyle factors, or environmental conditions not captured in our study. The inverse relationship between education and psoriasis (OR = 0.9 for higher education) is particularly noteworthy and aligns with observations in other chronic inflammatory conditions where socioeconomic gradients have been documented. These findings underscore the importance of considering social determinants of health in dermatological care and suggest that public health interventions might need to be tailored to address these socioeconomic dimensions, pending further research in representative samples.
      The influence of urbanization on skin disease prevalence in our sample, while less pronounced than other factors, still yields some noteworthy observations. The higher likelihood of reporting skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis or NMSC in large city residents (more than 500,000 inhabitants) aligns with concepts such as the “hygiene hypothesis” and the potential role of environmental factors in these conditions [28]. On the contrary, the lower odds of reporting certain conditions in rural residents, such as viral warts or hair loss, may reflect differences in lifestyle, environmental exposures, or access to healthcare between urban and rural areas [29].
      The geographical patterns revealed in our analysis suggest a complex urban–rural divide in dermatological health among our participants. The increased prevalence of atopic dermatitis/eczema (OR = 1.20) and NMSC (OR = 2.00) in large metropolitan areas with populations exceeding 500,000 inhabitants points to potential environmental factors at play or differences in healthcare access leading to diagnosis. Urban environments typically feature higher concentrations of air pollutants, different occupational profiles, and potentially higher ultraviolet radiation exposure due to outdoor recreational activities, all of which may contribute to these conditions. Conversely, rural residents in our sample showed lower odds of reporting conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis (OR = 0.80) and viral warts (OR = 0.90), which could reflect differences in population density affecting transmission patterns or reporting differences due to healthcare access disparities. These geographical variations highlight the importance of considering regionally tailored approaches to dermatological care. The substantial difference in reported NMSC prevalence between major urban centers and smaller communities (OR = 2.00) is particularly concerning and suggests potential screening and detection disparities that should be addressed through mobile screening initiatives or enhanced training of primary care providers in rural settings, if these findings are representative of broader population trends.
      The findings from this epidemiological study, while primarily reflecting a large sample of Polish internet users, have potential implications for public health strategies and healthcare resource allocation in Poland, should they be corroborated by population-representative data. Our data suggest several targeted approaches that could improve dermatological care: First, the high prevalence of common conditions such as herpes labialis (40.6%), dandruff (37.6%), and acne (32.7%) highlights a potentially high self-perceived burden and the need for improved access to basic dermatological care and over-the-counter treatments. Second, the distinct age-related patterns observed for various conditions indicate opportunities for age-targeted screening and prevention programs—particularly for skin cancer detection in older age groups (e.g., those over 65 years in our sample), where prevalence increased substantially. Third, our gender-stratified analysis suggests that dermatological education and awareness campaigns could potentially benefit from gender-specific content addressing the conditions most relevant to each group, such as seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis for men, and rosacea and herpes labialis for women, as suggested by our data. Finally, the notable socioeconomic and geographical variations in disease prevalence seen in our sample point to potential disparities in care access that merit further attention from health policymakers. Implementation of teledermatology services could help bridge these gaps, particularly for underserved rural populations that showed different disease patterns compared with urban centers in our study.
      Several limitations of this study must be carefully considered when interpreting its findings. Foremost, the significant gender imbalance in the study sample (81.7% female versus 18.1% male) and the overrepresentation of individuals with higher education (54.2%) compared with national figures (approximately 51.7% female in the adult population; ~28–30% with tertiary education) severely limit the generalizability of our prevalence estimates to the entire Polish population, particularly for male-specific conditions or those less common in highly educated or female demographics. This gender disparity likely resulted from self-selection bias in our online recruitment methodology, as women and more educated individuals tend to exhibit higher participation rates in health-related surveys. Consequently, our results are most applicable to Polish adult internet users, predominantly female and with higher education, who engage with online health information.
      The reliance on self-reported clinically diagnosed conditions introduces significant methodological challenges. Although the survey specifically asked about diseases that had been “diagnosed,” respondents may have interpreted this differently—some reporting only physician-confirmed diagnoses while others potentially including self-diagnosed conditions. This introduces condition-specific reporting biases; while easily recognizable conditions such as acne may be accurately reported as diagnosed, more complex diagnoses such as melanoma versus NMSC showed evidence of substantial misclassification (with a reported ratio of 1:1.5 instead of the expected 1:18–20).
      Furthermore, the study focused on a preselected list of 20 common skin conditions. This means that other frequently encountered dermatological issues, such as dry skin (xerosis cutis), which was not specifically queried, were not captured. Consequently, while providing data on the selected conditions, our findings may not represent the total burden of all skin complaints in the surveyed population, and the prevalence of dermatological issues not on our list remains unassessed by this study. In addition, online survey distribution inherently excludes populations with limited internet access or digital literacy, particularly affecting older individuals and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds or remote rural areas—potentially underrepresenting these groups in our sample and influencing the observed prevalence of conditions more common in these populations. The cross-sectional nature of the study precludes establishing causal relationships between demographic factors and skin disease prevalence; all reported associations are correlational. Furthermore, our urbanization analysis fails to account for residential mobility throughout participants’ lives. Many respondents may have relocated between rural and urban settings over their lifetime, making current residence an imperfect proxy for lifetime environmental exposure patterns. Another significant methodological challenge arises from our lifetime prevalence approach for age-related analyses. Logically, older participants should report higher lifetime prevalence for most conditions simply due to longer exposure time. The fact that some conditions such as atopic dermatitis show lower prevalence in older age groups despite accumulating over a lifetime suggests potential recall bias, cohort effects, or changing diagnostic practices across generations. These temporal considerations significantly complicate interpretation of age-related findings. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that individuals with existing skin conditions were more motivated to participate (participation bias), potentially inflating overall prevalence estimates compared with what might be found in the general population.
      It is also crucial to consider the distinction between statistical significance and clinical relevance, particularly given our study’s large sample size. With 27,000 participants, even small absolute differences in prevalence or modest odds ratios can reach statistical significance without necessarily representing meaningful clinical or public health distinctions. For example, the difference in vitiligo prevalence between males and females (3.0% versus 2.3%, p = 0.0044) in our sample is statistically significant but represents a small absolute difference of 0.7 percentage points. Throughout our analysis, while reporting all statistically significant findings, we have attempted to highlight findings with both statistical significance and more substantial effect sizes, such as the larger gender differences observed in psoriasis (OR = 2.1), seborrheic dermatitis (OR = 1.7), and dandruff (OR = 1.7), which are more likely to reflect true biological or behavioral differences rather than statistical artifacts alone.
      The observed prevalence ratio between self-reported melanoma (1.1%) and NMSC (1.7%) warrants particular attention as a specific example of a study limitation related to information bias. As previously mentioned, this deviates substantially from established epidemiological patterns (expected ~1:18–20 in European cancer registries). Our findings therefore suggest a potential misclassification issue in self-reporting of these conditions. This inconsistency likely stems from several factors: diagnostic confusion among respondents even when recalling a physician’s diagnosis, the higher public awareness of melanoma compared with NMSCs, or potentially the tendency to recall more serious diagnoses. Among older participants (> 65 years) in our sample, the ratio improves somewhat (1.8% melanoma versus 4.0% non-melanoma), better approximating expected patterns, possibly reflecting more accurate diagnosis or reporting in this population segment with higher overall skin cancer prevalence. This finding underscores the caution needed when interpreting self-reported cancer data from surveys. Indeed, even large-scale studies such as the Global Burden of Disease acknowledge challenges in NMSC data due to inconsistent recording in cancer registries globally, necessitating complex estimation processes [30].
      Future research directions could encompass several key areas to build upon these findings and address their limitations. Longitudinal studies would be valuable to examine the progression and causal risk factors for skin diseases in the Polish context. Efforts to achieve more balanced gender representation and recruit samples more representative of the general Polish population, potentially through mixed-mode data collection or registry-based approaches, are crucial for obtaining more robust national prevalence estimates and ensuring broader generalizability. Including clinical examinations or linkage to medical records could help validate self-reported diagnoses and potentially uncover undiagnosed conditions. Further investigation into additional factors such as detailed lifestyle habits (e.g., diet, smoking patterns, specific sun protection behaviors), occupational exposures, and genetic predispositions could shed light on their relation to skin disease prevalence. Lastly, exploring the economic and quality-of-life impacts of the high reported prevalence of skin diseases observed in this study would provide crucial insights for healthcare planning and demonstrating the broader implications of these conditions.
    
    
      Conclusions
      This large-scale cross-sectional online survey study provides valuable initial insights into the self-reported lifetime prevalence of a range of common skin conditions and their associated risk factors among a sample of 27,000 adult internet users in Poland. Our findings from this specific sample highlight significant variations in reported prevalence based on gender, age, education level, and urbanization. The high reported lifetime prevalence of common skin conditions in this cohort underscores the potential substantial burden these diseases may place on public health systems and individuals’ quality of life if these patterns are reflective of broader population trends. The observed demographic patterns offer preliminary data and hypotheses for tailoring preventive strategies, allocating healthcare resources, and guiding future research efforts in dermatology and public health in Poland, pending further validation in representative population samples.
      Our findings from this study of Polish internet users emphasize the potential need for targeted interventions and public health initiatives that consider the demographic and socioeconomic factors influencing skin disease prevalence. By addressing these conditions through a lens that accounts for gender, age, education, and urbanization, healthcare providers and policymakers can work towards more effective prevention, early detection, and management of skin diseases within similar populations and can inform the design of broader public health strategies, subject to confirmation of these findings in the general Polish population.

Title: Climate Change, Natural Disasters, and Cutaneous Fungal Infections

Abstract: ABSTRACTFungal infections are an important source of morbidity and mortality that can manifest as superficial or invasive diseases. Diagnostic techniques for human fungal pathogens remain problematic, and multi‐drug resistance is emerging. This review addresses the potential emergence of new fungal pathogens in changing environments and reported instances of cutaneous fungal infections after natural disasters. Global warming does more than increase the mean global temperature; it is associated with changing precipitation patterns and major climatic events. With natural disasters, niches are created for the proliferation of fungal pathogens affecting humans across previously existing geographical boundaries. Here, we reviewed reports of cutaneous fungal infections after natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Of importance is the potential for thermal adaptation leading to the evolution of new human pathogens, exacerbated by the elevated environmental fungal levels in disaster situations. Studies have documented higher risks of contracting typical tinea infections, as well as opportunistic, trauma‐related infections by environmental fungi. The latter is especially concerning due to atypical clinical presentations that could lead to treatment delays, antifungal resistance, and systemic complications. These support the importance of considering climate change as affecting the adaptation of these pathogens and the consequences of this change for human populations. A One Health framework should be advocated to address the impact of climate change on dermatological care.

Body: 1
      Introduction
      Climate change has brought about more frequent and intense natural disasters and weather events in recent years [1]. It is not uncommon to have infectious disease outbreaks after natural disasters, which can be acquired from inhalation or cutaneous inoculation of fungal spores [2]. Pathogenic fungi can be displaced from their natural habitats during a disaster and manifest in areas outside their normal range, coming into contact with injured individuals [2]. Therefore, climate change can alter the geographic range and vectors of pathogenic fungi, causing an emergence of diseases where they were not previously reported.
      The epidemiology of cutaneous fungal infections—affecting up to one quarter of the world's population—is affected by climate change [3]. According to the International Society of Dermatology Climate Change Committee, dermatophytes (e.g., Trichophyton, Microsporum, Epidermophyton) show strong evidence of climate sensitivity, thriving under high‐temperature and high‐humidity conditions [1]. Climate migration has been linked to an increased incidence of tinea capitis affecting predominantly children, including those caused by the less frequently encountered pathogens in the Western hemisphere (e.g., Trichophyton soudanense, Microsporum langeronii) [4]. In the Indian subcontinent, an increased incidence of heat waves, among other factors such as abuse of over‐the‐counter medications, has been linked to an epidemiological shift whereby Trichophyton mentagrophytes has displaced Trichophyton rubrum as the dominant pathogen in the causation of superficial fungal infections [1, 5, 6]. This trend underlies a significant treatment challenge due to the development of antifungal resistance concerning the current epidemic of an anthropophilic “clonal offshoot” of T. mentagrophytes, now known as Trichophyton indotineae [7].
      Based on the ecological niche, dermatophytes can be classified as anthropophilic (e.g., 
T. rubrum
), zoophilic (e.g., T. mentagrophytes), or geophilic (e.g., Nannizia gypsea [formerly Microsporum gypseum]). It is conceivable that during natural disasters or extreme weather events, the release/dispersal of fungal spores, fluctuations in temperature and humidity, as well as damage to the skin barrier stemming from wounds or dermatitis, may create points of entry for uncommon dermatophytic fungi (e.g., Acremonium, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium) [2]. An infection by zoophilic or geophilic dermatophytes may manifest atypical clinical presentations (e.g., swelling, nodules, pustules) that can increase the risk of misdiagnosis as bacterial infections or non‐infectious dermatitis [8]; therefore, it is advisable for healthcare providers—especially in regions where climate‐sensitive fungal pathogens were once considered rare—to remain vigilant and consider testing for possible fungal infections.
    
    
      2
      Climatic Variables
      Even minor or gradual changes in temperature, moisture, and wind patterns might affect fungal growth, distribution, and dispersal [9]. For pathogens adapted to infect the human skin (i.e., dermatophytes), tinea pedis and onychomycosis may be diagnosed more frequently during spring and summer seasons, as well as during “El Niño” characterized by increased rainfall and higher temperatures [10]. At a coastal region in Bangladesh, a survey conducted over a short span of 2 years (2015–2017) found a 16% increase in tinea diagnoses, while no significant changes were found for acne, psoriasis, or seborrheic dermatitis [11]. In a study of 150 United States (US) military personnel transferred to the tropical region of Panama, 10 new cases of tinea corporis and 5 new cases of tinea cruris were identified [12]. Under varying humidity conditions, the mycelium of T. mentagrophytes penetrated the stratum corneum faster at 100% humidity, while no penetration was observed at 80% humidity [13].
      Seo et al. conducted a retrospective analysis of 116,903 patients diagnosed with superficial fungal infections—mostly tinea pedis and onychomycosis—in Korea [14]. Their findings showed a significant positive correlation between patient visits and increasing temperatures as well as humidity, while wind speed and sunshine duration exhibited a negative correlation with patient visits [14]. In contrast, in tropical regions such as Thailand, an analysis of 185,202 outpatients found that the risk of diagnosing dermatophytosis was up to twice as high when the temperature decreased to about 20°C compared to the mean temperature of 28°C [15]. Authors attributed this finding to skin barrier damage caused by the cold, arid local climate [15].
      Unlike ectotherms such as insects and reptiles, immunocompetent humans acquire fungal infections less frequently due to a combination of immune factors and endothermy [9, 16]. The latter excludes most fungi which are restricted to growing at 12°C–30°C except for pathogenic strains (≤ 1% of total fungal species) [9, 16]. The maintenance of an ambient temperature at 37°C—a condition that inhibits approximately 80% of soil and plant fungi—as well as the ability to develop fevers, has been proposed as an adaptive advantage throughout human evolution [9, 16]. For every 1°C gained in body temperature in the range of 30°C–42°C, approximately 6% of the fungal species are excluded as potential pathogens [9].
      As global ambient temperatures rise, there is an increased risk of fungi acquiring thermotolerance (i.e., thermal adaptation) (Figure 1) [2]. Fungi can evolve thermotolerance, which is defined as “the ability to grow at mammalian and higher temperatures,” allowing for them to become pathogenic [16]. Under experimental conditions, filamentous fungi can gradually adapt to increasing temperatures [17]. Accordingly, thermotolerant fungi are already abundant in sub/tropical climates, including molds such as Fonsecaea pedrosoi, causing chromoblastomycosis, dimorphic fungi such as Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Penicillium marneffei, and yeasts such as Cryptococcus gattii [1, 16]. Thermotolerance is manifest among Basidiomycetes (e.g., Cryptococcus) [9], which has the potential to become a major contributor of new fungal pathogens [16]. Furthermore, thermal adaptation may be increasingly facilitated by the observed decline in average human body temperatures, which has been recorded at 0.03°C per birth decade since the Industrial Revolution in the US [18]. Since some non‐pathogenic fungi also exhibit thermotolerant features [19], further studies on host–microbe interactions (e.g., immune response, virulence factors) are warranted to better detect the emergence of new fungal pathogens, especially in view of the 1.55°C increase in the global temperature in the past decade with 2024 being the warmest year on record [20].
      
        FIGURE 1
        
          Emergence of cutaneous fungal infections due to climate change. Rising global temperatures (+1.55°C over the past decade) is hypothesized to be a driver of thermal adaptation of environmental fungi, thereby increasing its pathogenic potential. Extreme weather events and natural disasters facilitate the dispersal of fungal spores. In disaster situations, a combination of skin trauma, psycho‐emotional stress, congregate living settings, and exposure to high temperature and humidity predisposes individuals to cutaneous fungal infections. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant about testing for possible fungal infections as these patients may present with atypical signs or symptoms. Targeted treatments are warranted considering the risk of systemic complications (mucormycosis, chromoblastomycosis) and drug resistance. Surveillance efforts of new and emerging fungal pathogens in the era of climate change are warranted.
        
        
      
    
    
      3
      Ambient Conditions
      Skin surface temperatures (29.8°C–34.7°C) are lower than the body's internal temperature (37°C), ranging from 34.7°C for the anterior neck, nasolabial, perioral, eyelid, and forehead regions, 33.8°C for the palm, and 29.8°C–30.1°C for the left and right sole [21]. Hence, a lower thermal adaptation threshold is conceivable for environmental molds or yeasts for establishing cutaneous infections [19]. One example is Fusarium solani—an uncommon cause of tinea pedis and onychomycosis—that can grow up to 34.3°C [22, 23, 24]. Other nondermatophyte molds have also demonstrated keratinase activities in vitro (e.g., Acremonium, Aspergillus, Scopulariopsis, Neoscytalidium) [25]. Molds are ubiquitous and can be found in the air, soil, and water. Their abundance and distribution depend on climatic and environmental factors, including ambient temperature and moisture [5, 26, 27].
      Even though the human body has protection given by endothermy, outside the body there is potential for the proliferation of microorganisms with developing thermotolerance to colonize these surfaces, and not exclusively at wound sites. Before (internal) systemic changes associated with thermal adaptation become evident with ensuing global warming, those happening on the surface of the human skin may develop visibly sooner. Climatic shifts in temperature and rainfall can contribute to the geographic expansion of cases, as suggested for blastomycosis [28].

      Risk of Cutaneous Fungal Infections Associated With Natural Disasters
      Disruptive events at large scale, including major disasters such as earthquakes, extreme temperatures, drought, mass movements, extreme weather, floods, fog, volcanic activity, wildfires, and more, can trigger the dispersal and spread of fungal infections. Such natural disasters can disrupt fungal habitats [2, 10]. Fungi can appear superficially on the skin due to atmospheric transmission, even in indoor environments. Environmental disruptions that can disperse and aerosolize fungi or implant them via traumatic wounds (e.g., lacerations, abrasions, contusions) result in infections by previously very rare or unknown species of “emerging” fungal pathogens that affect human health (Figure 2) [30]. The movement of infection vectors (e.g., animals) outside of their natural habitats is another concern [13].

        4.1
        Earthquakes
        Earthquakes can disturb airborne fungi in dust, cause injuries, create unsanitary living conditions, and may trigger tsunamis introducing moisture. A comparison of dermatology outpatient visits found a significantly higher incidence of superficial fungal infections 3 months after an earthquake took place in Turkey (17.4% [205/1178]) compared to the same period from the year before (13.2% [117/889]), with the most common diagnosis being tinea pedis [31]. In contrast, 6 months after the earthquake, a higher incidence of pruritis and noninfectious dermatitis was found compared to the 3‐month period [31]. After Ecuador experienced a 7.8‐magnitude earthquake in 2016, an assessment of dermatological conditions in 214 patients identified dermatophytosis (15.9% [34/214]) as the most common [32].
        Following the Great East Japan Earthquake that preceded the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, a survey of environmental fungi found inside and surrounding evacuated homes was conducted in 2012–2013, which found elevated levels—exceeding 52,000 colony‐forming units (CFU)/m3—inside these homes during the summer [33]. Commonly detected molds included Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, and Penicillium [33], which have shown pathogenic potential in causing dermatomycoses [25, 34, 35, 36, 37]. In 2016, another 7.0‐magnitude earthquake took place in Japan, of which an unusual case of onychomycosis caused by Aspergillus subramanianii—with high in vitro resistance against fluconazole, itraconazole, and miconazole—was reported in a young, healthy female patient [38]. The patient presented with proximal yellow–brown nail discoloration and paronychia of the left hallux, was unresponsive to terbinafine 125 mg/day for 1 month prior to obtaining culture results, and was later successfully treated using topical efinaconazole 10% [38]. The authors attributed this case to the increased levels of dispersed fungal spores similar to the 2011 incident [38].
        In addition to direct trauma, exacerbation of inflammatory skin disorders—secondary to the increased psychological burden during disaster events—and concomitant infections or infestations may further predispose victims to cutaneous fungal infections [39]. In areas with infrastructure damage post the Great Hanshin Earthquake, 34%–38% of atopic dermatitis patients reported worsening of symptoms, compared to only 7% in areas without damage [40]. After two sequential 7.0‐magnitude earthquakes in Turkey in 1999, dermatological examinations of 1200 survivors found non‐infectious dermatitis, infestations, and infections (including tinea pedis) in 3.3% (40/1200), 6.6% (79/1200), and 2.9% (35/1200) of cases, respectively [41].
        Diseased animals are another risk factor that can lead to outbreaks of cutaneous fungal infections. Following an earthquake in Nepal, Asokan and Vanitha proposed a One Health approach in response to the higher risk of zoonotic infections resulting from the displacement and injuries of animals and livestock [42]. This proposal includes establishing a joint surveillance network between human and animal healthcare providers, expanding emergency medical care to veterinary facilities, and improving access to diagnostic testing [42].
      
      
        4.2
        Tsunamis and Flooding
        Cutaneous fungal infections—both typical (e.g., dermatophytosis) and atypical (e.g., chromoblastomycosis, mucormycosis)—are a recognized risk during major flooding events, including tsunamis [4, 43]. Dermatologists are advised to test and identify possible fungal infections, and initiate targeted treatments as certain environmental fungi can cause systemic complications with resistance against standard antifungals [43]. After severe flooding hit Nepal in 2017, a dermatology department saw a 48% increase in patient visits for skin diseases of both infectious and non‐infectious etiologies [44]. Superficial fungal infections—mostly tinea cruris—accounted for over half of the infectious cases, while contact dermatitis was the most common non‐infectious etiology [44]. Interdigital tinea pedis can also be observed after a flood [45]. While skin lesions due to trauma are the most common during the immediate periods after a flood, infections begin to take place as evacuees congregate in shelters with sub‐standard sanitary conditions [46]. Environmental disinfection (e.g., bleach) triggering contact dermatitis, and psycho‐emotional stress causing exacerbation of pre‐existing skin conditions, can further predispose individuals to fungal infections [46].
        The tsunami triggered by the 9.0‐magnitude earthquake on December 26, 2004 affected coastal areas spanning South Asia and East Africa [47]. A clinical assessment of 235 survivors by two dermatologists—totaling 265 skin disease diagnoses—revealed a high prevalence of infections or infestations at 32.5% (86/265), most of which were attributed to superficial fungal infections, especially tinea corporis, likely due to the submersion in water [47]. Concomitant high prevalence of atopic dermatitis (29.8% [79/265]) and skin traumas (29.4% [78/265]) was also reported that compromise the skin barrier, as well as the risk of bacterial mixed infections [47]. A case of mixed fungal infection—with dermatophytes and non‐dermatophyte molds—was reported following a severe flood in Bangladesh in 2022 [48]. The patient presented with sino‐orbital symptoms in addition to an annular rash; histopathological examination and culture of the orbital mass and skin revealed 
Aspergillus fumigatus
 and Trichophyton interdigitale, respectively [48]. Liposomal amphotericin B treatment was switched to voriconazole after obtaining culture results, and clinical resolution was achieved [48].
        Misdiagnosis and treatment delay can severely impact the outcome in patients with atypical clinical presentations caused by environmental fungi. In a case report, a patient who sustained multiple injuries from a flood presented with purulent ulcers of the limbs [49]. Surgical debridement and empirical antibiotic treatments were ineffective; signs of necrosis of his chest and thigh were later observed [49]. Histopathologic examination revealed fungal elements consistent with those of cutaneous mucormycosis, and liposomal amphotericin B was administered; despite this, necrotic areas expanded, warranting further debridement, and Apophysomyces elegans was identified [49]. In a similar case, a tsunami survivor with trauma‐related polymicrobial infection developed necrotizing fasciitis, which led to sepsis [50]. One week after admission, histopathologic examination confirmed the presence of 
A. elegans
, and liposomal amphotericin B treatment was initiated [50]. Authors noted that patients with polymicrobial infections—who sustained soft‐tissue injuries from an area affected by natural disasters—should be promptly tested for possible fungal infection [50].
      
      
        4.3
        Hurricanes and Tornados
        In addition to damaged infrastructures, dispersed fungal spores, and skin traumas, flooding that often coincides with tropical cyclones may further create favorable conditions for fungal growth [51, 52]. In particular, one year post Hurricane María, indoor fungal levels were measured 1.4–2.7 times higher in homes that suffered flooding damage compared to non‐flooded homes [53]. A transient increase in Aspergillus was reported during this period [53]. Similar findings were reported after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, where homes that sustained extensive water damage had high fungal levels up to 67,000 CFU/m3—with Aspergillus niger as the most commonly identified species [54]. Both indoor air and surface revealed 4‐fold higher mold spore counts compared to outdoor air samples, which puts evacuees at risk when they return to their homes [55].
        Although a direct link between indoor mold exposure and the development of dermatomycosis has not been established, it is conceivable that higher quantities of infectious propagules (e.g., arthroconidia, conidia) on surfaces facilitating fungal adhesion would increase the risk of superficial infections [56]. A parallel can be drawn with mycotic skin or nail dusts—yielding viable dermatophytes and non‐dermatophyte mold isolates—generated during podiatric care [57], where fungal aerosolization as a result of nail abrasion treatments has been recognized as a potential occupational hazard causing superficial and respiratory tract infections.
        Soon after Hurricane Katrina, among rescue workers who were often submerged in water for prolonged periods, cases of tinea corporis were reported from two locations among other dermatologic conditions [58]. A rare case of systemic chromoblastomycosis, with multiple purulent lesions on the face, was reported in a young farm worker following Hurricane Katrina [59]. Initial presentation led to empirical antibiotic treatments, which were switched to amphotericin B treatment based on the suspicion of fungal infection that was later confirmed by histopathologic examination [59].
        Hurricane Harvey, a category 4 event that brought disastrous flooding to southeast Texas (USA) in August 2017, significantly increased the risk of skin diseases, especially when contact with floodwaters are reported [60]. A survey of 403 survivors reported that 7.2% (29/403) and 12.4% (50/403) were affected by tinea pedis and skin irritation, respectively [61]. Furthermore, ethnic minorities (e.g., non‐Hispanic Black patients) and individuals who lost employment report a higher risk of posttraumatic stress and limited access to healthcare, both of which may further increase the risk of dermatological diseases [61].
        Healthcare providers are advised to be cognizant of locally acquired fungal infections that have the potential to become invasive—especially concerning vulnerable, immunocompromised individuals—and to conduct confirmatory testing as appropriate [62]. Three cases of chromoblastomycosis—commonly caused by Fonsecaea pedrosoi following trauma caused by soiled foreign debris—were reported after hurricane Ike, with unusual clinical presentations that initially led to the suspicion of non‐melanoma skin cancers [63]. Histopathologic examinations revealed characteristic pigmented brown muriform fungal cells, along with hyperplasia, fibrosis, and multinucleated giant cells [63].
        After a tornado landed in Joplin (Missouri, USA) in 2011, 13 patients with suspected cutaneous mucormycosis—with positive cultures for saprophytic Apophysomyces trapeziformis—were identified [64]. It is suspected that A. trapeziformis spores were carried along the tornado's path and inoculated into these patients through foreign debris [64]. All patients were immunocompetent and suffered multiple wounds including fractures, blunt and/or penetrating trauma, and presented with subcutaneous necrosis [64]. Of the 6 patients who received ineffective treatments for mucormycosis prior to obtaining culture results—reflecting a potential knowledge gap regarding molds causing subcutaneous infections during a natural disaster—four died [64].
      
    
    
      5
      Conclusions
      There is an opportunity to improve dermatology care in response to the growing challenges posed by climate change. As healthcare providers increasingly encounter uncommon cutaneous disorders—such as infections by environmental fungi that can mimic bacterial infections or mixed bacterial‐fungal infections—related to extreme weather events and natural disasters, a detailed history‐taking is advisable [27, 65]. Testing for possible fungal infection should not be overlooked in disaster situations (Figure 1). Due to the effects of rising global temperatures, environmental fungi may acquire thermotolerance thereby elevating their pathogenic potential, especially concerning our growing aging population [26]. This risk could be exacerbated by the abrupt ecological disturbance brought about by natural disasters that increases the risk of direct contact (e.g., trauma, submersion in water, congregated shelters) [26]. Increasing education and expanding access to diagnostic testing remain key to ensure that appropriate treatments are initiated. Direct microscopic examination and histopathologic examination can detect the presence of fungal elements; however, genus‐ or species‐level identification often requires culture which can be impractical in emergency situations due to the long incubation period and low sensitivity [43]. Recent developments in DNA‐based detection methods (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) may help address this challenge. Further surveillance efforts on new and emerging fungal pathogens are warranted to better inform future public health actions.

Title: Self-determined strategies for physical activity motivation among women with polycystic ovary syndrome

Abstract: Background:According to clinical practice guidelines for polycystic ovary syndrome, first-line treatment includes performing 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on most days of the week plus at least 2 days of resistance training. However, <40% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome engage in regular physical activity, and about 60% are sedentary. Research evidence supports theory-informed physical activity interventions to improve motivation for physical activity. This study examined the fit of a behavioral change theory for women with polycystic ovary syndrome.Objectives:The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze physical activity barriers through the lens of self-determination theory and identify motivational strategies that may promote initiation and maintenance of physical activity among women with polycystic ovary syndrome.Design:The study involved a qualitative, descriptive design using theory-driven thematic analysis.Methods:After emailing a demographic questionnaire and Personal Health Questionnaire-8 to screen for depressive symptoms, participants (n = 7) met three times via Zoom during the summer of 2021. Meetings were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed.Results:Participants were aged 33.9 (±8.1) years, premenopausal, mostly White (71%), educated (100% with at least some college), employed full-time (86%), and married (86%) with a mean depressive symptoms score of 6.4 (±3.4) indicating mild depression. Strategies such as a buddy system, physician support, technology, and behavioral change techniques are necessary to meet the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness among women with polycystic ovary syndrome to help increase exercise motivation.Conclusion:Findings supported the use of self-determination theory by emphasizing that the social context of polycystic ovary syndrome can undermine physical activity behavior. Thus, physical activity interventions should consider the social context, peer support system, and mental health status of women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and include tailored programs and motivational strategies to help meet the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

Body: Introduction
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrinopathy among women,
1
 affects about 20 million women in the United States across all races and ethnicities.
2
 PCOS is a complex, heterogenous collection of symptoms involving hormonal dysregulation.
1
 Diagnosis of PCOS occurs when two of three of the following conditions are present: menstrual irregularities, clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and/or polycystic ovarian morphology.
3
 PCOS is associated with central adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and depressive symptoms, placing the women at risk for cardiometabolic diseases, reproductive cancers,
4
 and psychological morbidity.
5
 Women with PCOS are three to eight times more likely to have depressive symptoms
6
 and seven times more likely to attempt suicide
7
 than women without PCOS.
      Physical activity (PA) has been well-established as a therapy for managing PCOS symptoms and reducing the risk of comorbidities.
3
 PA is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles requiring energy expenditure.
8
 PA includes exercise, both aerobic and resistance, which is planned, structured bodily movement with a fitness goal.
8
 As such, the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice PCOS Guidelines recommend that women with PCOS follow the PA guideline of 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity to prevent or delay the onset of comorbidities, as well as improve cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass index, and quality-of-life.3,8 Resistance exercise is recommended on at least 2 days/week,
3
 as it has been shown to increase metabolic capacity via increased lean mass, reduce insulin resistance, and increase bone mineral density,9,10 while reducing depressive symptoms among those with and without clinical depression, and more in women with PCOS than in women without PCOS.3,9
–15 However, <40% of women with PCOS engage in regular PA, and about 60% are sedentary.16,17
      PCOS-specific PA barriers have been reported as stigma-related stress due to appearance (e.g. hirsutism, obesity), symptom burden (e.g. depressive symptoms, fatigue), and lack of understanding of the condition by society in general, time, and confidence.18,19 These barriers impede motivation to exercise, especially in group-based and public settings, necessitating a search for effective and meaningful strategies to improve motivation. Research evidence supports interventions underpinned by theory and inclusive of psychological support.
20
 Motivation determines the initiation and maintenance of PA, as motivation drives all aspects of intention, activation, and persistence of goal-directed behavior.
21
 Interventions informed by self-determination theory (SDT) have growing evidence of improving motivation by identifying supports that help meet psychological needs.
22
 When psychological needs are met, people attain more intrinsic motivation to exercise, which may lead to behavioral engagement.22
–25 Thus, the purposes of this qualitative descriptive study were to explore PA barriers through the lens of SDT and identify motivational strategies that may promote the initiation and maintenance of PA among women with PCOS.
    
    
      Theoretical framework
      The science of health behavior change has increasingly emphasized theory-based approaches to intervention, as theories help identify underlying mechanisms of action and proximal targets of intervention (i.e. mediators and moderators).21,22 SDT, as introduced by Ryan and Deci, is a metatheory for the study of human motivation, personality development, and well-being.
23
 The underlying assumption of SDT is that humans not only are naturally inspired and agentic, but also require social supports or strategies to develop and maintain natural potential and well-being. SDT intersects personality and social context to predict the likelihood of adopting and maintaining a behavior, such as PA, by predominantly focusing on a taxonomy of motivations and three innate psychological needs.
      SDT was chosen as the lens for structuring the study, given its focus on motivation within unique social contexts. SDT explains that social norms may suppress an individual’s innate psychological needs of autonomy (freedom to choose a behavior), competence (ability to perform and master a behavior), and relatedness (sense of belonginess).
23
 Unmet needs suppress natural self-governing and create a shift in motivation away from self-determined behavior to more externally motivated behavior. Furthermore, based on SDT, individuals with decreased motivation require multiple strategies to improve need satisfaction. Thus, the extent to which people meet these psychological needs dictates their position on the continuum of motivation. Researchers that have employed an SDT perspective found that self-determination and motivational orientation, along with self-efficacy, offered an appropriate framework to further understand PA behavior among those with chronic health conditions

      Materials and methods
      
        Design and ethics approval
        A qualitative descriptive study was conducted from May 2021 to December 2021. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and 45 CFR 46.104(d)(2) and 45 CFR 46.111(a)(7). The University of South Carolina (USC) Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study (Pro00105265, December 7, 2020). As approved by the USC IRB, verbal consent was obtained from participants prior to each virtual meeting. The interviewer was supported by NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award (1F31 NR019206-01A1).
      
      
        Study setting and sample
        A focus group was formed of women with PCOS (n = 7) to analyze exercise barriers through the lens of SDT and identify motivational strategies that may promote initiation and maintenance of PA among women with PCOS from the perspective of women with PCOS. Our recruitment goal was for 6–10 individuals to keep the group size manageable and its participants comfortable sharing their expertise while also achieving diversity of opinion. Participants were recruited using the snowball method and social media, which allowed for a wider geographic reach and more diversity among a small group of participants. The researchers had no previous relationships with the participants. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was conducted virtually and used secure email to distribute and collect surveys.
      
      
        Inclusion/exclusion criteria
        Eligibility criteria were premenopausal women with a confirmed diagnosis of PCOS by a healthcare provider, an age of 18–42 years, and internet access for virtual meetings. Potential participants were required to submit via secured email confirmation of a PCOS diagnosis by a healthcare provider to be considered for the study. The age range was chosen based on a systematic review and meta-analysis that defined the start of the menopausal transition for women with PCOS at or greater than the age 45 years.
27

      
      
        Measures
        
          Demographics
          The demographic questionnaire included age, race, geographic location, educational attainment, employment and insurance status, marital status, number of children, height, weight, and comorbidities (see Supplemental Appendix A).
        
        
          Depressive symptoms
          The Personal Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) is one of several tools used to assess depressive symptoms among women with PCOS in previous studies, and it has been recommended for symptom monitoring among patients with medical (versus psychiatric) diagnoses.
28
 As such, the PHQ-8 was used to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms experienced within the past 2 weeks. The PHQ-8 consists of eight items with a four-point rating ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). As a screening instrument, PHQ-8 scores suggest potential levels depression based on the number of depressive symptoms: 5–9 mild, 10–19 moderate, and ⩾20 major.
29
 Construct validity was reported at 0.75 and internal reliability was reported at 0.81.
29

        
      
      
        Virtual meetings
        The focus group met three times for ~1 h/meeting. The virtual meetings took place during the summer months spaced apart by ~3 weeks. The researcher (P.J.W.) introduced the purpose of the focus group. Meetings were structured by using an SDT-informed interview guide (see Supplemental Appendix B) created by the first author (P.J.W.), a doctoral-prepared female nurse researcher with experience working with and recruiting women with PCOS, and the second author (R.M.D.), a female qualitative methodologist and nurse practitioner familiar with PCOS medical management. Interview guides were specifically developed to address knowledge, facilitators, and barriers of PA,19,30 SDT psychological needs,
23
 and strategies to increase motivation. Meetings were conducted by P.J.W. and audio-recorded via Zoom, a cloud-based videoconferencing service. Zoom offers the ability to communicate in real-time with participants in different geographic locations via computer or mobile device. This platform was chosen because it has several privacy features including user authentication, secure recording and storage, and real-time meeting encryption. Field notes were made during the focus group meetings. The recordings were transcribed and then compared to the audio to ensure that they accurately represented the participants’ discussion. Each participant received a $20 e-gift card per meeting for their time and expertise.
      
      
        Data analysis
        Using theory-driven thematic analysis,
31
 the data were organized and categorized based on predetermined themes drawn from SDT. Two researchers (P.J.W. and R.M.D.) independently coded the responses using deductive reasoning according to the three SDT psychological needs. Subsequently, an iterative categorization process was followed to organize data according to theoretical constructs. The two researchers discussed data saturation and unanimously agreed that data saturation had been reached after the three focus group meetings. Rigor was strengthened through the reflexivity of the researchers via reflexive journaling and regular meetings to discuss personal experiences and knowledge of both PCOS and PA in relation to the statements of the focus group participants. Rigor was further enhanced by following COREQ guidelines
32
 (see Supplementary File).
      
    
    
      Results
      Participants (n = 7) represented three U.S. states (South Carolina, Georgia, and Texas) and four different counties in South Carolina, both rural and suburban. Participants were 33.9 (±8.1) years of age, mostly White (71%), married (86%), and employed full-time (86%). The participants’ mean depressive symptom score was 6.4 (±3.4), indicating “mild depression.” Participants’ characteristics are listed in Table 1.

      The PHQ-8 scores of the three participants who reported depression as a comorbidity corresponded.
      All focus group participants acknowledged the multiple health benefits of exercise. However, all reported being insufficiently active, that is, they did not regularly accumulate 150 min of moderate intensity PA most days of the week. All focus group participants reported using extrinsic motivation to make decisions about PA behavior. For example, one participant was motivated by incentives such as discounts on facility memberships and another participant was motivated by her physician’s guidance to lose weight. No participant represented amotivation nor fully self-determined intrinsic motivation. When asked to rank the SDT psychological needs in general, focus group participants unanimously agreed that relatedness was most important, with mixed responses about whether competence or autonomy would follow.
      Themes were deductively categorized by the three psychological needs of SDT. A fourth theme, motivational strategies, comprised focus group participants’ suggestions for improving exercise motivation. Quotes illuminating the themes are italicized and presented as stated by the focus group participants and are minimally edited for clarity (e.g. removal of dysfluencies). Participants’ initial and age follow each quote.
      
        Autonomy: And it was something else that hindered me
        Autonomy is the volitional choice and control of one’s behavior. Internal and external factors impact autonomy by creating shifts in perception of priorities. The women filled multiple roles (e.g. spouse, mother, daughter, employee, student, patient), resulting in daily competing time demands. As a result, the women felt a loss of control in their ability to schedule time for PA: My barrier is time.
        
Life just got in the way. (M, 41)Other barriers, children, family, school, blah, blah, blah, blah get in the way. (C, 37)My biggest struggle is making the time and making that a priority over other things. (S, 29)

        As women who struggle with PCOS, some women expressed being robbed of choice due to comorbid conditions, such as hidradenitis suppurativa (inflamed and infected sweat glands; n = 1) and depression (n = 3).
        
Other factors that go with PCOS impede physical activity. Hidradenitis suppurativa is one of those factors. So the sweat glands may become clogged, they break out into boils and they have to be surgically removed. So the more you sweat, the more there’s pain. (M, 42)It (PCOS) was affecting me mentally . . . so like depression and just like . . . hopelessness. Um, so, you know, I never exercised. (J, 23)

        Hyperandrogenism is a feature of PCOS with physical sequelae such as obesity, hirsutism, and acne. Several women expressed feeling “unattractive” and having poor self-image, which led to avoidance of PA in public places.
        
You hate your body and you feel fat all the time. (T, 24)

        Autonomous choices were also limited by facility location and costs.
        
And the next closest one (gym) is 30 minutes away. (C, 37)And so there’s also the monetary component to it as well. (M, 42)

      
      
        Competence: (Lack of weight loss) crushed my spirit. And, ever since then, I haven’t tried to do anything
        Competence involves the sense of mastery and self-efficacy of one’s behavior and the need to feel effective when performing that behavior. A person will more likely accomplish a task or meet a goal when feeling capable of successfully performing the related activities, or when the task results in the expected outcome.
        
[Exercise] gave me a sense of accomplishment. (J, 23)It’s (the body) working correctly and everything’s going great and you’re powerful, I think that’s the most rewarding thing about it. (S, 29)

        When one feels ineffective, incompetent, or unable to accomplish a task or goal, the effort may seem meaningless.
13

        
So I will not do a group because I have no rhythm. I can’t do anything like that. (M, 41)It’s depressing when you don’t see your results, you don’t want to try anymore. (C, 41)

        Focus group participants cited weight loss as the most salient reason to both start and stop a PA. Weight loss was prioritized based on body dissatisfaction and physician advice.
        
I want to lose weight. I don’t like my body. (C, 41)The doctor says, “Well just lose weight, a lot of your symptoms will be fixed.” Wouldn’t it be nice to know how? (M, 42)

      
      
        Relatedness: We are in it together
        Relatedness is the interpersonal dimension, reflecting the extent to which a person feels connected to and accepted by others and has caring relationships.
32

        
I can’t do it on my own. (S, 29)just like family in general or anyone who will just go on that journey with you (M, 41)

        Focus group participants explicitly stated the need for social contact(s) who can relate to or understand PCOS and its physical and mental consequences.
        
just someone who understands what you’re going through and who is someone who is also knowledgeable about PCOS. (C, 41)

        Participants discussed that groups, even groups with all women, were intimidating because they felt less feminine and less of a woman compared to others.
        
They don’t have it (PCOS) so they don’t get it. I compare myself to them and feel less of a woman. I’m big, have all this hair, can’t have a baby. (S, 29)

      
      
        Motivational Strategies: I’ve, like everybody, tried all kinds of different things and I’ve liked some and I’ve not liked some
        Focus group participants listed potential motivational strategies to promote and sustain PA as a healthy lifestyle behavior. For example, one participant stated that coaching (the support) increased her competence, which in turn enabled autonomy to make exercise choices that accommodated limited time and space. Each motivational support caters to one or more psychological needs. For example, the motivational support of people affects the need for relatedness; a service support affects the need for competence; the motivational support of technology mostly affects the need for autonomy, whereas the motivational support of behavioral change strategies affects all three needs. The motivational strategies presented by the focus group are listed in order of importance to the participants and with stated advantages and disadvantages of each in relation to general and PCOS-specific PA barriers (Table 3).

      Discussion
      Women with PCOS encounter general and PCOS-specific exercise barriers. According to SDT, the cultural context of PCOS necessitates meaningful motivational strategies to help meet psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In turn, as needs are met, motivation to engage in PA becomes more intrinsic. The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze PA barriers through the lens of SDT, a motivation theory, and identify motivational strategies that may promote PA initiation and maintenance from the perspective of women with PCOS. The discussion is organized by the three innate SDT psychological needs and then motivational strategies that may promote need satisfaction and increase PA motivation.
      
        Autonomy
        Focus group participants expressed that volitional choice to be physically active followed other priorities, such as family demands. The focus group participants detailed many competing time commitments. Although this is probably true for many people, the women with PCOS desired strategies to best incorporate PA given both life demands (e.g. family) and PCOS-specific needs (e.g. grooming rituals, physical comorbidities). The concept of little to no discretionary time to participate in activities that build social and human capital is referred to as time poverty.
33
 Time poverty encourages unhealthy behaviors, (e.g. buying fast food) which creates a cyclic pattern of defeat or learned helplessness.
33
 Time poverty is not necessarily a mismatch between responsibilities and available hours, but a mental outlook on the value of those hours.
33
 A creative way to “fund time” is changing perspective about the value of time, such as giving time a financial equivalent and then budgeting time and money together.
33

        Focus group participants described responsibilities beyond the traditional definition of paid employment, such as childrearing, caregiving for aging parents, and other family obligations. Women in developed and developing nations spend, respectively, an average of 2 and 3.4 times more hours per day than men on unpaid work shouldering the heaviest burden of cooking, cleaning, and caring for children and the elderly.
34
 This inequitable gender-based allocation of unpaid domestic work, representing “double-duty” for women who enter the workforce, often limits discretionary time for women and promotes self-neglect.
35
 While this finding is not unique to women with PCOS, other researchers reported that women with PCOS more strongly adhere to cultural female gender roles to reclaim a feminine identity.
36

        The systemic oppression of women via gender inequality is accompanied by restrictive gender norms dictating societal female expectations, including the gender-specific ideals permeated about a woman’s presentation and gender performativity.
37
 The focus group participants frequently mentioned hirsutism and obesity as PCOS aspects causing stigma-related stress. Pfister and Romer found similar results when they interviewed Danish women with PCOS, all who perceived their bodies as different from femininity norms.
38
 Negative self-evaluation of bodyweight and shape can lead to low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and social phobia.
39
 More and Phillips also found that body dissatisfaction led to less autonomous regulation among women, which led to less frequent PA.
40
 Lastly, several of the participants in the current study reported lack of autonomy due to physical and mental features imposed by PCOS (e.g. obesity, hidradenitis suppurativa, depressive symptoms). Some conditions could be circumvented by choosing alternative forms of PA. For example, the participant with hidradenitis suppurativa chose swimming versus traditional cardiovascular exercise such as walking to avoid hot environments and thus an aggravating factor of excessive perspiration. Recent meta-analyses indicate that PA can significantly improve psychological well-being among people with depressive symptoms.
8

However, focus group participants stated that depression caused lack of energy and drive to be physically active. Screening for depressive symptoms and providing resources may be an essential first step before prescribing PA as therapeutic management. Longitudinal studies assessing PA and subjective well-being have shown that greater well-being predicts maintained or increased activity over time,
41
 and that changes in leisure-time exercise predict changes in happiness.
42

      
      
        Competence
        Focus group participants relayed clinical encounters and public health messaging that issued absent or confusing directives for weight loss. Clinical guidance for weight loss often excludes accurate and more detailed information about the role of exercise for weight loss as PA alone will not produce quick weight loss.
43
 PA enhances the ability to lose weight over time but mostly confers metabolic benefits.
44
 Accurate and specific guidance about realistic goal expectations increases knowledge and builds self-efficacy.
        In addition to accurate and detailed information, individuals must experience success with a behavior to build confidence in their actions.
45
 Positive behavioral experiences build self-efficacy, which in turn facilitates perceived competence for the behavior.
45
 Goal reframing is one strategy to establish other expected and more immediate health outcomes such as improved endurance, increased strength, and improved sleep. Recognizing more immediate health outcomes as goals and subsequently meeting those goals increases the likelihood for sustained behavior change.
45
 Positive and informative feedback also increases perceived competence.
46

        Focus group participants reported physicians as a trusted source of information and competent care. However, physicians cite barriers to exercise counseling such as lack of clinical time, limited education about PA dosing, and the absence of a PA counseling protocol.
47

      
      
        Relatedness
        Several studies (correlational, longitudinal, experimental) revealed a strong positive correlation between sense of belongingness and life satisfaction and wellness.
48
 The focus group participants agreed. Focus group participants emphasized the need to be understood in the context of PCOS, which is consistent with previous literature about women with PCOS.
49
 Being socially connected is influential on psychological and emotional well-being and has a significant and positive influence on physical well-being and overall longevity.
50
 As social beings, people strive for social connection to feel accepted and supported and avoid isolation and loneliness. This sentiment was consistent with a series of experiments designed to examine types of social connection, in which people were motivated to perform a task based on “being understood” or “mere belonging.” Being understood was independent of casual acquaintance versus longstanding relationships with family or friends or one individual versus many people.
51
 Thus, strategies to enable relatedness for women with PCOS could include online peer support, a buddy system, or social support groups.
        Focus group participants ranked relatedness as the most important category when discussing motivational strategies to be more physically active. In a cross-sectional study of women with PCOS about PA perceptions, respondents reported a choice not to be physically active due to feelings of rejection, stigma, and isolation from a general lack of understanding from others about PCOS and its impact.
19
 In a similar study to ours, Dalgas et al. found that unmet needs of relatedness led to feelings of isolation and frustration that prohibited PA, especially in group settings.
52
 As the focus group participants discussed, relatedness is enhanced when there is understanding of PCOS specifically followed by consistent support from the source providing true understanding.
        The SDT literature emphasizes conducting a needs analysis to prioritize the psychological needs when designing tailored interventions for most populations.
53
 However, when considering the differential effects of the three psychological needs among women in general, relatedness contributed strongly to autonomy and competence while autonomy and competence did not impact relatedness. As such, behavioral interventions should consider prioritizing relatedness needs to affect all other needs and promote intervention efficacy among women with PCOS.,
      
      
        Interrelatedness of the psychological needs
        The three innate psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are also interrelated, as they each reinforce the other and work synergistically to contribute to overall well-being and promote more intrinsic motivation.
22

        
          Autonomy and competence
          Autonomy facilitates competence. As individuals choose behaviors that align with priorities and interests, they will invest time and effort in those activities or behaviors, leading to the development of competence. Conversely competence can enhance autonomy. As competence for a behavior increases, individuals are more likely to choose that behavior.
        
        
          Autonomy and relatedness
          Autonomy also involves the freedom to choose when and how to engage in social interactions. Voluntary social interactions are more likely to yield more authentic and meaningful connections with others. Perceived social support, especially types such as emotional and appraisal,
54
 can reinforce autonomous choice.
        
        
          Competence and relatedness
          Findings from information management research indicate that competence leads to knowledge sharing,
55
 which can create a sense of contribution to and connection with those receiving informational support.
56
 In turn, relatedness involves a social environment in which individuals can receive feedback, guidance, and support to fuel their competence and create reciprocal giving and mutual reciprocity.
57

        
      
      
        Motivational strategies
        Motivational strategies may serve to help meet one or more psychological needs. For example, a personal trainer (the support) may provide empathetic listening and feedback to meet both relatedness and competence needs. Whereas, a technological device, such as a smartwatch, may promote and individual to engage in PA through daily activity recording and self-competition, thus meeting the need of autonomy. Behavioral change strategies, such as proper goal setting, meet all three psychosocial needs, as a woman with PCOS must first choose a behavior (autonomy) which she feels confident to perform (competence) and then find one or more people or norms, or benchmarks for which to “compete” or compare (relatedness). The importance of relatedness for engaging in PA superseded autonomy and competence for this sample of women with PCOS. Focus group participants explicitly stated that they sought encouragement from strategies such as tips and success stories about PA and were more motivated by the support of people who had experiential or factual PCOS knowledge.
        Self-awareness is critical while traversing the dynamic life course.
58
 Behavioral self-regulation is the capacity to assess cognitive, affective, and/or behavioral responses to daily life in the context of a larger goal and adapt accordingly.
59
 Thus, motivational strategies may need to change or coexist to match life’s demands. For example, a woman with PCOS may benefit from a coach to enable competence and a technological device to promote accountability. The capacity to self-regulate and appropriately choose alternative motivational strategies are teachable skills. These skills could be taught by healthcare professionals, such as nurses or other ancillary staff.
      
      
        Implications for PA interventions and healthcare
        The findings of this qualitative study highlight implications for PA interventions for women with PCOS. SDT can be a suitable theory to underpin PA interventions to increase motivation for PA by recognizing the context of PCOS and including strategies to meet the women’s psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Developers of PA interventions, specifically within the health realm, could consider the comprehensive guides to SDT techniques complied by Teixeira et al.
46
 For example, to meet the need for autonomy, women with PCOS can be provided choice of activity and given responsibility to schedule the activity. Strategies to meet the need for competence could include goal setting, positive and process-focused feedback, and extrinsic rewards. The need for relatedness could include individual and/or group-level social support from peers with PCOS or healthcare professionals knowledgeable about PCOS. Such social support systems can provide women with PCOS understanding from others while avoiding stigma-related stress due to appearance.
        Healthcare professionals, as a trusted source of information, have a role in promoting PA to women with PCOS. They are in a unique position to recognize and reinforce healthy behaviors and the additional health-related outcomes from PA. Available resources, such as the “Exercise is Medicine,” an initiative launched by the American College of Sports Medicine in 2007, are available to healthcare providers. These resources include PA counseling scripts and PA protocols, thus enabling healthcare providers to prescribe PA as part of a treatment plan.
60
 One resource of the “Exercise is Medicine” initiative is the “PA level as a vital sign” strategy and form (https://www.exerciseismedicine.org/).
60
 Assessing PA as a vital sign at clinic visits could increase the value of PA among clinicians, encourage counseling about positive PA outcome expectations, and confirm the patients’ knowledge and efforts.
        Interventions that meet the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in PA for women with PCOS can lead to more autonomous motivation to be physically active. PA, performed regularly over time, will promote health outcomes by helping to manage PCOS symptoms and mitigating the risk of cardiometabolic health conditions.
      
      
        Limitations
        A limitation of this study was the small sample size of volunteer participants, which limits generalizability. Our recruitment goal was for 6–10 individuals to keep the group size manageable and the participants comfortable sharing their expertise while also achieving diversity of opinion. Additionally, the homogeneity the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics limits generalizability to the entire population of premenopausal women with PCOS. However, the statistics for demographics, PA, and body mass index matched those found in other U.S. studies of premenopausal women with PCOS, except for depressive symptomology. The participants, as a group, were categorized as having mild depressive symptomology compared to moderate in another U.S. PCOS study.
61
 Thus, the volunteer participants for this focus group may have been more motivated to meet and discuss PA and therefore may not be representative of the PCOS population. While the PHQ-8 scores were better than those in other U.S. studies involving women with PCOS, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the responses to the depressive symptom screening tool. None of the focus group participants were teenagers or women of peri-postmenopausal age or residing in other countries, further limiting generalizability to all women with PCOS. Some focus group participants (n = 3) were recruited from other PCOS studies, which can introduce bias, as these participants may be more interested in research. None of the participants reported meeting the guidelines for PA; however, they may have been more interested in PA as compared to the population of U.S. women with PCOS. A limitation was the lack of a validated tool to measure PA status among the participants. Due to COVID-19, meetings were held virtually. This was a strength as women from different geographic locations participated. However, one meeting was interrupted with technical challenges of a dropped call and pauses due to poor connectivity. Overall, the virtual platform was convenient and cost-effective, while providing an easier and more secure way to record and transcribe sessions. The data were collected in three virtual meetings, possibly limiting its depth. The interview guide was not pilot tested. The researchers analyzed each transcript immediately after meetings to check for data saturation. Only two researchers iteratively read all transcripts and worked to identify codes and sub-themes. However, a third researcher was available for any variance, and all authors reviewed the themes and supporting evidence.
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      PCOS is a chronic health condition requiring life-long management, and PA is a first-line treatment strategy. Enacting PA requires motivation. The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze PA barriers through the lens of SDT, a motivation theory, and identify strategies that may promote PA initiation and maintenance among women with PCOS.
      Findings from this study underscored that the cultural context of PCOS can undermine PA behavior. Motivational strategies can help meet the women’s psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness and promote PA adoption and maintenance. Assessments of cultural context and depressive symptoms, followed by skill-building (e.g. choosing alternative PA types and environmental settings), could precede a PA intervention to circumvent PA barriers. Lastly, focus group participants strongly emphasized the need to be understood by those who support their efforts to adopt and maintain PA. All focus group participants agreed that social support from one or more people with factual or experiential PCOS knowledge would enable motivation. Such motivational strategies could include a peer coach, a community support group, or an invested healthcare team to provide accountability and encouragement.

Title: Adverse Effects of the Long-term use of an N95 Respirator in Healthcare Workers

Abstract: ObjectivesHealthcare workers must take stringent infection control measures against coronavirus disease. Previous reports have indicated that N95 respirators cause fatigue, discomfort, and physical symptoms, such as headaches. We aimed to comparatively analyze the effect of the use of surgical and N95 respirators for long hours on the performance of healthcare workers. This is the first study to validate the effect of wearing N95 respirators on work efficiency.Materials and MethodsThis study was conducted from April 2021 to October 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Healthy healthcare workers at an emergency department were subjected to a performance task program comprising four tasks conducted before and after wearing a surgical mask/N95 respirator for at least 4 h, and the results were compared.ResultsThe study included 17 (male, 8 [47.1%]) healthcare workers. The age ranged from 22 to 32 (mean, 26.6) years. For each task, the rate of change in the percentage of correct responses, rate of decline in reaction time, and rate of decline in reaction time for correct responses were calculated before and after wearing the two types of masks. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of decline in reaction time between the masks for all tasks. However, there was a trend toward a high rate of decline in the alphanumeric detection task.ConclusionsUsing an N95 respirator for 4 h continuously did not adversely affect work efficiency. Although prolonged work under conditions of discomfort should be avoided, it is unlikely that N95 respirators will adversely affect the performance of healthcare workers.

      Due to the significant increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 during the global pandemic, healthcare workers, especially those working in emergency and outpatient departments, were required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 respirators more frequently than other healthcare workers to ensure infection prevention. The “N” in N95 stands for “Not resistant to oil” which is denoted by NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health), and the “95” indicates particle filtration efficiency; an N95 respirator can prevent the inhalation of 95% of all airborne particles, including very small particles. On the other hand, surgical masks provide a barrier against large respiratory particles. However, they do not prevent leakage around the mask during inhalation because of poor adherence to the skin. Thus, surgical masks do not effectively protect healthcare workers against infection when directly caring for patients with COVID-19.
      Previous studies on the N95 respirator have reported that prolonged wearing causes discomfort and headache1, 2). The level of discomfort increases over time, regardless of the type of respirator3). In addition, studies have reported direct physical effects of wearing N95 respirators, such as increased heart rate, body temperature, and humidity4). The tight seal of N95 respirators increases the blood's carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, causing hypercapnia, which leads to cognitive decline5).
      The impaired ventilation, cardiopulmonary capacity, and comfort of N95 respirators compared with surgical masks has led to concerns about healthcare workers developing health problems from prolonged work under such conditions, as well as the danger to patients who receive medical treatment from workers wearing N95 respirators6). Error in judgment in treating patients with severe conditions can make a difference between life and death. This is an important issue from the standpoint of patient safety.
      To date, no report has examined the effects of the prolonged use of N95 respirators on work efficiency. However, wearing N95 respirators for extended periods while experiencing discomfort or headaches may cause a decrease in work efficiency. Therefore, we hypothesized that healthcare workers' work efficiency might decrease when wearing N95 respirators for extended periods. We compared healthcare workers' performance in the emergency department before and after wearing N95 respirators and surgical masks to determine if any adverse effects were associated with using an N95 respirator. This is the first study to validate the effect of wearing N95 respirators on work efficiency.
    
    
      Materials and Methods
      
        Study design
        This study was conducted at Juntendo University Nerima Hospital from April 2021 to October 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. We recruited healthy participants consisting of emergency room healthcare professionals with no prior history of illness, including underlying respiratory diseases. Both oral and written informed consent were obtained from all the participants. The participants were alternately assigned to wear a surgical mask on day 1 and an N95 respirator on day 2 or vice versa. When wearing an N95 respirator, the fit task was always conducted. The participants were instructed not to remove their masks during the study period. All experiments were conducted during the day shift. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Juntendo University Nerima Hospital and was conducted in accordance with the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki.
      
      
        Evaluation of work efficiency
        We chose to measure simple arithmetic ability and reaction time to assess the effect of prolonged use of N95 respirators on work efficiency. Whether a decrease in cognitive function tasks is directly related to a decrease in work efficiency is thought to depend on the specific work content and situation. Therefore, since it is difficult to accurately predict the effect on actual work, we thought that the effect could be evaluated as accurately as possible by conducting the task in an actual work environment.
        Therefore, we decided to evaluate four tasks: (1) a simple task: measuring reaction speed to presented marks, (2) an addition task: adding presented numbers, (3) an alphabet-number recognition task: measuring reaction speed to recognize target letters (alphabet and numbers), and (4) a short-term memory task: judging multiple numbers of target letters. The following four tasks have been evaluated. The integrated software, Performance Test Program (PTP) N-020-10000 (Norpro Light Systems, Tokyo, Japan), was used for these tasks (http://www.norupro.ne.jp/pdf/P01.pdf). Four tasks were administered and the percentage change in percent correct response, percent decrease in reaction time, and percent decrease in correct reaction time were calculated before and after wearing the two mask types.
        Participants wore surgical masks and performed all four tasks once. At a later date, they wore N95 respirators and similar tasks once. These tasks were administered before and after a 4-hour normal working day, wearing one of the masks. On each occasion, participants were also asked about symptoms such as headache and dyspnea.
        For these four tasks, the learning effect intervention was minimized by having the participants practice thoroughly before administering the task.
        Regarding the wearing of surgical masks, N95 respirators were worn only when responding to patients with fever or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Participants used blue surgical masks (White Cross Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and 3M™ AURA™ N95 1870 + MED respirators (3M Company, Saint Paul, MN, USA).
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Stata 16.1 package (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was used to perform all statistical analyses. The normality of the distribution of continuous variables was tested using the D'Agostino-Pearson method. T-tests were used to assess statistical differences between surgical and N95 respirators. P-values were reported to determine statistical significance. Statistical significance was set at a two-sided p-value of <0.05.
      
    
    
      Results
      In all, 17 (male, 8 [47.1%]) participants were included. The industry of the participants included 3 emergency physicians and 14 nurses. The age ranged from 22 to 32 (mean, 26.6) years. There was no smoker among the participants. In addition, no participant removed mask during observation period. No participant complained of headaches or other symptoms requiring medical treatment after wearing each mask for 4 h. All participants complained of subjective symptoms of discomfort and breathlessness while wearing an N95 respirator, although none stopped wearing the mask. During the study period, the average number of patients who visited the emergency room was 1473 per month and transported by ambulance was 531 per month.
      According to the D'Agostino-Pearson test, all results obtained as continuous variables followed the normal distribution. Figure 1 shows a change in % of correct answers. As a result, there was no difference in the change in the percentage of correct answers on all tasks. Figure 2 shows Δtime all, namely reaction time related to all answers. The time to reply to all questions that did not involve correct or incorrect answers showed no significant difference for all tasks. However, in task 3, those wearing the N95 respirator tended to take longer to answer the questions before and after wearing the mask. Figure 3 shows Δtime correct, namely the reaction time restricted to correct answers only. A comparison of the change in time for correctly answered questions showed no significant differences in all tasks. Those wearing the N95 respirator took longer to answer the questions in task 3, both before and after wearing the mask. As summary, there was no significant difference in the percent change in percent correct response between the two mask types for all tasks. In addition, there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of decrease in reaction time for any of the tasks. On the other hand, there was a trend towards a higher rate of decrease in performance on task 3.

      Discussion
      Our study shows that an N95 respirator can continuously be worn for up to 4 h without problems. Although prolonged work in an environment that causes discomfort should be avoided, using this mask is unlikely to affect medical care directly. In previous reports, even though using N95 respirators was effective as an infection control measure, headaches, dryness of the eyes and nose, and acne were pointed out as the adverse effects of long periods of mask use2, 5). In another study, using N95 respirators significantly increased the occurrence of headache, dyspnea, drowsiness, and numbness compared with surgical masks, leading to decreased alertness and concentration, as assessed by a questionnaire survey7). A treadmill experiment using an N95 respirator resulted in increased heart and respiratory rates and a significant increase in transcutaneous partial pressure of CO2, although blood oxygen levels remained unchanged8). It has also been reported that wearing an N95 respirator significantly reduces minute ventilation volumes6). Decreased minute ventilation volume and increased transcutaneous carbon dioxide concentrations indicate elevated blood CO2 levels. Elevated CO2 concentrations have been reported to alter intracranial arterial hemodynamics, causing discomfort, fatigue, dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, general malaise, lethargy and drowsiness, and even cognitive decline5, 9-12).
      A recent study showed that the quality of CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) was reduced by fatigue when using an N95 respirator compared to a surgical mask13). While previous studies have suggested that wearing N95 respirators may impair performance, this study found no negative effect of mask use on work performance. In this study, there was a learning effect with improvements in reaction time and percentage correct before and after wearing the mask in each task, but only the rate of decrease in reaction time in task 3 was higher for the surgical mask than for the N95 respirator. Although it is possible that surgical masks may have less of an impact on work performance than N95 respirators when viewed from this perspective, the current validation did not find a significant change in performance with N95 respirator wear, either in correct response rate or reaction time.
      Reports have shown that when healthy participants wore a surgical mask for one hour of light to moderate exercise, heart rate, respiratory rate, and transcutaneous carbon dioxide concentration increased14). In addition, the use of a surgical mask during 30 minutes of continuous exercise has been reported to be associated with decreased minute ventilation, increased heart rate, and prolonged inspiratory time15).
      A report examining the effects of mask use in professional chess players showed that mask use decreased cognitive function16).
      It is possible that healthcare workers who wore surgical masks for routine infection prevention prior to the COVID-19 outbreak were accustomed to the burden of wearing surgical masks; Su et al. also found that healthcare workers who wore N95 respirators and surgical masks during an 8-hour shift in the emergency department reported no adverse physiological or psychological symptoms17).
      This study focused on the effects of wearing N95 respirators at work. However, in actual operations, patients with infectious diseases are handled by workers wearing full PPE, including gowns, eye guards, and masks. This study focused on the effectiveness of wearing N95 respirators in the workplace. However, the comparison of standard precautions to full PPE may have influenced the results, because in the real world, workers wearing full PPE, including gowns, eye protection, and masks, handle patients with infectious diseases.
      Healthcare workers who handle critically ill patients in emergency departments and intensive care units need to be alert to the possibility of a deteriorating work environment, as a single mistake can directly affect a patient's life. This study was conducted in a hospital setting, suggesting that the wearing of N95 respirators is unlikely to interfere with medical practice. However, given that medical masks have also been reported to increase discomfort due to perspiration and humidity, there is concern that prehospital activities (e.g., emergency medical teams, ambulances, and disaster relief efforts) may be affected by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, and thus the duration of wear should be considered.
      This study had some limitations. First, this was a single-center study, and the number of participants was small. In addition, the task was conducted 1 year after the COVID-19 epidemic, which may have caused its adaptability. Second, the busyness of the emergency department varies from day to day, resulting in workload variations. We could not uniform the workload of busyness. Third, factors related to performance including work content, fatigue level, and other information, which might have affected the results were not evaluated. The results could have been different if the task had been limited to more intensive situations, such as lengthy surgeries or dealing with patients in cardiopulmonary arrest. Fourth, we only validated 4 hours workload effects, and we need to make more verifications including wearing N95 respirators longer. Therefore, we are unable to discuss the relationship between the length of N95 respirator and the effect on their actual work. Fifth, we didn't consider the cause, follow up, or care for symptoms that occurred during tasks. Therefore, we are unable to discuss the relationship between wearing N95 respirators and the symptoms.
    
    
      Conclusion
      This study is the first report to assess the effect of wearing N95 respirators on work efficiency. Our study showed that up to 4 h of continuous wearing of an N95 respirator might not hinder the performance of healthcare workers. Although prolonged work in an environment that causes discomfort at work should be avoided, mask use is unlikely to have a direct adverse effect on medical care. In the future, work efficiency using masks should be evaluated in different situations of high workloads, such as long surgeries and life-saving care for critically ill patients.

@CQD/Oleuropein

Abstract: ABSTRACTBackgroundSkin aging, which is affected by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, leads to reduced elastin, collagen, and hydration levels.AimsThis study aimed to utilize modified exosomal content with treated Oleuropein and Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein to modulate gene and microRNA expression on the HFFF2 cells in vitro in order to reduce skin aging.Material & MethodsFe3O4@C/Oleuropein was synthesized using the hydrothermal method and confirmed by XRD, FTIR, and SEM. The MTT assay was conducted to test toxicity Following this, hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were treated with Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein and Oleuropein. Exosomes derived from the treatments were extracted by ultracentrifugation and evaluated by DLS and western blotting. HFFF2 cells were treated with exosomes derived from the treatments. The expression of the studied genes and related microRNAs was measured using qRT‐PCR. Also, the effect of exosomes derived from the treatments on HFFF2 cells was evaluated using flow cytometry.ResultsThe results showed that the expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes was significantly increased with Oleuropein (500 μg/mL) and Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein (250 μg/mL) treatments, especially when treated with exosomes derived from treatments. Moreover, the expression of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs was significantly downregulated, and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated in the HFFF2 cells, which was consistent with the exosome cargo derived from treated cells.ConclusionsExosomes can increase gene expression and reduce microRNAs associated with skin antiaging. Using modified exosomal content treated with Oleuropein and Fe3O4@CQD/Oleuropein is generally effective for preventing skin aging and also presents innovative methods for skin care.

      Introduction
      Currently, there is growing attention to skin rejuvenation because of the increase in people's life expectancy [1]. Skin aging is a complicated process that includes intrinsic (chronological) aging and extrinsic aging (e.g., sun, gravity, sleeping positions, and smoking). In both types of aging, there is a decrease in elastin, collagen, and loss in hydration leading to dryness and atrophy, with fine wrinkling in the skin [2, 3]. Fibroblasts, the predominant population responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, are the primary cause of skin senescence [4, 5].
      So far, researchers have extensively studied skin rejuvenation and proposed strategies for reducing skin aging, one of which is nanotechnology. Recent research shows that Fe3O4@CQDs significantly reduce ROS and inhibit pro‐inflammatory cytokines like TNF‐α and IL‐1β, addressing oxidative damage and aging pathways [6, 7]. Studies indicate that nanotechnology enhances cosmetic effectiveness by increasing capture efficiency, controlling drug release, improving physical stability, increasing moisturization, and enhancing ultraviolet (UV) protection [8].
      As more people become interested in natural cosmetics, Oleuropein, a phenolic substance found in olive leaves (
Olea europaea
), has been shown to have multiple skin advantages in clinical studies [9, 10, 11]. This secoiridoid has a special ability to change how different mechanisms of skin aging interact, such as oxidative stress, inflammasome activation, and the degeneration of the ECM [12, 13]. Studies show that it is able to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower the levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines including IL‐1β and IL‐6, and boost collagen production through pathways that are mediated by VEGF [14, 15]. Oleuropein increases collagen synthesis and inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade skin collagen and elastin [10, 11].
      Also, studies have shown that vitamin C is one of the compounds that affects skin rejuvenation. Vitamin C neutralizes free radicals and increases collagen, but Oleuropein does better in the role of removing ROS [16] while also inhibiting IL‐1β and caspase‐1‐mediated inflammasome activation, which is associated with both oxidative stress and inflammation [16]. Oleuropein is stable in formulations, unlike vitamin C, which degrades quickly [17]. Based on research, Retinol enhances skin texture but induces inflammation and necessitates the avoidance of UV exposure, whereas Fe3O4@CQDs decrease inflammation without impairing barrier function, and their magnetic targeting minimizes systemic exposure [18, 19]. In contrast to hyaluronic acid or niacinamide, which disperse widely, Fe3O4@CQDs improve spatial accuracy by concentrating active ingredients in photoaged or inflammatory regions [8, 20, 21].
      Another strategy for decreasing skin aging is exosomes, which have recently attracted significant attention as a therapy for skin rejuvenation [22]. Exosomes, a category of skincare agents, are increasing in popularity in the cosmetics industry because of their therapeutic and rejuvenating characteristics. They contain proteins, lipids, nucleic acids like microRNAs, and other compounds, which promote healing, hydration, and skin health. Exosomes can be modified by manipulating the culture medium or cell content and can repair skin damage such as sunburn and acne scars. They also contain bioactive compounds that protect the skin from environmental influences and minimize dark spots [23, 24, 25, 26]. On the other hand, microRNAs are one of the most major molecules present in exosomes [27]. MicroRNAs have been shown to have various activities in skin aging after differentially expressed microRNAs were identified based on the results of microRNA sequence analysis [28].
      Recent clinical trials and research have shown that both unmodified and modified (engineered) exosomes, particularly those sourced from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and fibroblasts, are efficacious in skin rejuvenation, wound healing, and enhancement of barrier function [29, 30, 31]. Also, exosome‐based creams represent an innovative method in cosmetic dermatology, proving efficacy in skin rejuvenation, hydration, pigmentation correction, and wound healing [31, 32].
      Research findings suggest that multiple signaling pathways play a role in the process of skin aging. Insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a key protein that stimulates keratinocyte growth [4]. Many downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and MAPK, are phosphorylated as a result of IGF1 activation of the insulin‐like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) [33]. IGF1 activates the PI3PK/AKT pathway, prevents dermal fibroblasts from UV‐B‐induced programmed cell death, and promotes cell survival via the MAPK pathway [34]. Also, epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a mitogenic polypeptide. It can activate and multiply myofibroblasts through the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways [35, 36]. EGF has a bright future in cosmetic antiaging applications because it plays an important role in upregulating fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in the skin [37].
      The present study aimed to utilize modified exosomal content with treated Oleuropein and Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein to modulate the expression of genes (IGF1, IGF1R, EGF, COL1A1, and ELN) and microRNAs (hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, hsa‐let‐7e‐5p, and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p) related to IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K pathways on the HFFF2 cells (in vitro) in order to reduce the aging process in the skin.

Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein Synthesis
        Fe3O4 (Cas No 1309‐37‐1; US Research Nanomaterials Inc., USA) nanoparticles (1 g) and d‐glucose (0.5 g: a compound of carbon origin) were suspended in 60 mL of distilled water, and the suspension was sonicated for 30 min. Subsequently, using the hydrothermal method, the suspension was incubated at 180°C for 5 h to synthesize Fe3O4@CQD in the Hydrothermal Autoclave. Thereafter, the synthesized Fe3O4@CQD was separated by centrifugation at 2000 g for min. After washing with water and ethanol, the samples were dried using a freeze dryer. In the following, 1 g of dried Fe3O4@CQD and 0.1 g of Oleuropein (32619‐42‐4; Sigma‐Aldrich, Germany) were suspended in 50 mL of distilled water and stirred by a shaker for 24 h to make Fe3O4@CQD/Oleuropein. Finally, the Fe@C/Ole NPs were gathered, washed, and dried using a freeze dryer.

          Characteristics of Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein Synthesis
          The synthesized Fe@C/Ole and functional groups of the particles were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy. The assay was carried out using an FTIR (SHIMADZU, Japan) device in a wave range of 500–4000 cm−1. X‐ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to assess the physical phase and crystal structure of Fe@C/Ole (CuKα, radiation, λ = 0.154056) at a scanning speed of 2° per minute (2θ range from 10° to 80°). Additionally, the size range, morphology, and aggregation level of the synthesized Fe@C/Ole were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (TESCAN MiRa3).
        
      
      
        2.2
        Cell Culture
        Human umbilical cord mesenchymal cells (hUC‐MSCs) were cultured according to Maleki et al. method [38]. Also, the fibroblast cell line (HFFF2) was purchased from the National Cell Bank of Iran (NCBI; Pasteur Institute, Tehran, Iran). Cell culture was performed using LG‐DMEM (Biosera, France), 10% FBS (Gibco, USA), Pen/Strep 100 μg/mL (Biosera, France), and then hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were incubated in 96% humidity containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were subcultured respectively after 80% and 90% confluency using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Gibco, USA).
      
      
        2.3
        Cell Viability Assay (MTT Assay)
        hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells suspensions were seeded in a 96‐well culture plate, and after incubation for 24 h, hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were treated with a gradient concentration of Fe@C/Ole (0–1000 μg/mL) and Ole (0–2000 μg/mL). The plates were incubated for 24 and 48 h. Next, the medium was removed, and MTT (2‐(4,5‐dimethythiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added. After incubation for 4 h, the contents of the wells were removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the wells (the assay was repeated three times). The IC50 and IC25 were calculated by measuring the absorbance of the formazan crystals at a wavelength of 570 nm (Awareness Microwell Plate Reader Chromate 4300, USA).
      
      
        2.4
        Treatment of Cells With Fe@C/Ole and Ole
        The hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were seeded for 24 h before treatment in culture flasks. The next day, the hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were treated with Fe@C/Ole (IC25 ≃ 250 μg/mL) and Ole (IC25 ≃ 500 μg/mL) for 24 h; IC25 was utilized to reduce damage and maintain the safety of the cells.

          Exosomes Isolation
          The cell culture supernatants were collected and transferred into centrifuge microtubes after 24 h of treatment with Fe@C/Ole and Ole. We extracted exosomes from exosomes isolated from cell cultures by ultracentrifugation using optimized protocols (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). In summary, the supernatants were centrifuged in the following order: 300 g, 2000 g, 10 min each, at 4°C, and 10 000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatants obtained were ultracentrifuged at 100 000 g for 90 min at 4°C. Next, the pellets were resuspended in PBS and ultracentrifuged at 100 000 g for 90 min at 4°C. Finally, the pellets were resuspended in 500 μL of PBS and stored at −80°C.

            Western Blot Analysis
            Isolated hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes (500 μL) and HFFF2‐derived exosomes resuspended in PBS were lysed in a lysis buffer. After centrifuging at 12 000 g for 12 min at 4°C, the supernatant containing protein was extracted and stored in a freezer at −20°C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay. Quantified proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Thermo Scientific, USA) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA (Roche, Germany) for 2 h and then incubated with primary antibodies against CD63 (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐5275), CD9 (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐18 869), and β‐actin (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐47 778) for 18 h. After washing, the membranes were incubated for 1:15 h 15 min with a secondary anti‐rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐2357). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used to detect the bands, and ImageJ software was used for analysis.

        The HFFF2 cells were seeded for 24 h before treatment in culture flasks. The next day, the HFFF2 cells were treated with hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes and HFFF2‐derived exosomes (at Bradford assay concentration) for 24 h.
      
      
        2.7
        Prediction of microRNAs Related to Studied Genes
        In silico studies were employed to confirm the selected microRNAs associated with studied genes utilizing various algorithms, including TargetScan, miRDB, miRTarBase, miRNet, miRbase, BiBiServ2‐RNAhybrid, and the Ensembl genome browser 112 databases.
      
      
        2.8
        Gene and microRNA Expression Analysis by qRT‐PCR

        Total RNA was extracted using EX6101‐RNX Plus Solution (SinaClone, Iran) at two levels: level 1. hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups (at IC25 concentration) for 24 h, and level 2. HFFF2 cells treated with hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes, HFFF2‐derived exosomes, and control groups (at Bradford assay concentration) for 24 h. Additionally, microRNAs were isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol at two levels: level 1. hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes and HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups (at IC25 concentration) for 24 h, and level 2. HFFF2 cells treated with hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes, HFFF2‐derived exosomes, and control groups (at Bradford assay concentration) for 24 h. The genomic DNA‐free RNA was quantified by the absorption 260/280 nm Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Then, cDNA was synthesized using the SinaClon First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (SinaClone, Iran) from total extracted RNAs according to the manufacturer's protocol; also, cDNA of extracted microRNAs was synthesized utilizing Stem Loop specific primers according to the instructions of the SinaClon First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (SinaClone, Iran).
        The relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF was analyzed by qRT‐PCR using the gene‐specific primers shown in Table S1. The relative expression of these genes was examined at two levels: level 1. hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups, and level 2. HFFF2 cells treated with hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes, HFFF2‐derived exosomes, and control groups. On the other hand, the relative expression of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs was examined using the microRNA‐specific primers presented in Table S2. The relative expression of these microRNAs was analyzed at two levels: level 1. hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes, HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups, and level 2. HFFF2 cells treated with hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes, HFFF2‐derived exosomes, and control groups. Gene amplification was performed using the Sina SYBR Blue HS‐qPCR kit (SinaClone, Iran), in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Relative analysis at the mRNA and microRNA levels was performed with two replicates using the Pfaffl method with e−ΔΔCt compared to the GAPDH and U6 housekeeping genes, respectively.

        Flow Cytometry (Exosome Toxicity Investigation)
        Cells were harvested and stained with DAPI 10X (4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole). All tests were performed in triplicate. The cell cycle and apoptosis progression were measured using an automated multicolor Flow Cytometry system. Flow Cytometry results were evaluated using FlowJo software (version 10). Flow Cytometry was used to measure the apoptosis rate in the HFFF2 cells treated with hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes and HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups. The HFFF2 cells were treated with two different concentrations of exosomes: 5.71 μg/mL (Bradford assay concentration) for HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups, and 6.088 μg/mL (Bradford assay concentration) for hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups.

        Physicochemical Properties of Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein
        The FT‐IR spectra of Fe3O4, Ole, Fe3O4@CQD, and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole are shown in Figure 1. The functional groups of the synthesized nanoparticles were identified. The strong band at 3350–3500 cm−1 confirmed the O‐H stretching bond of the phenolic part of Ole and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole. The peaks at approximately 500–600 cm−1 correspond to Fe‐O bonding, confirming the presence of Fe3O4 in the structures of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CQD, and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole. Fe3O4@CQD and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole exhibited a C=O stretching band at 1710 cm−1, signifying the presence of Fe3O4‐CQD. C–H stretching vibration signals were observed at 2920 cm−1. The characteristic vibration of the carbonyl groups in the Ole molecule was responsible for the signals observed at 1720 cm−1. The signal appeared at 1597 cm−1 as a stretching vibration and 1386 cm−1 as a bending vibration belonging to the functional groups C = C and O‐H, respectively. These results indicated the presence of Ole in Fe3O4@CQD/Ole (Figure 1A). The XRD pattern of Oleuropein attached to magnetite nanoparticles. All the signals in this pattern match the information from the standard XRD pattern of magnetite nanoparticles and confirm the crystallinity of the nanoparticles (Figure 1B). Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a spherical spinel structure showed signals at (311), (220), (440), (511), (422), and (400). The absence of (110) (2θ = 21.220) and (104) (2θ = 33.150) signals indicates that neither goethite (α‐FeOOH) nor hematite (α‐Fe2O3) phases were formed in the samples. Additionally, the binding of Oleuropein does not change the structure of Fe3O4@CQD; a broad peak is observed between 2θ = 12–28, which pertains to the overlap between Oleuropein and Fe3O4@CQD (Figure 1B). The morphology and size of the nanoparticles were determined using field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FE‐SEM) technique. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the sample revealed a range of particle sizes, ranging from 30 to 80 nm. Therefore, the image illustrates that the particles of the sample ingredients exhibited a high degree of homogeneity and possessed a consistent, symmetrical, and uniform distribution (Figure 1C).

        Viability Percentage (MTT Assay)
        Fe@C/Ole was evaluated as a conductive particle in terms of cell viability (Figure 3A), and the IC50 for the HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs was 484.52 and 511 μg/mL, respectively. Cell treatment was performed using IC25 ≃ 250 μg/mL, although cell growth inhibition was also observed in this treatment.

        The effects of different concentrations of Ole on the viability of HFFF2 and hUC‐MSCs were studied (Figure 3B). The amount of the IC50 was estimated at 1035.4 μg/mL for the HFFF2 cells and 977.43 μg/mL for hUC‐MSCs; cell treatment was performed utilizing IC25 ≃ 500 μg/mL for cell treatment as an effective concentration. In summary, the results showed that Ole has cell inhibition and toxicity in very high concentrations (IC50 ≃ 1000 μg/mL), whereas Fe@C/Ole has them in low concentrations (IC25 ≃ 500 μg/mL).

          Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)
          The exosomes isolated size from hUC‐MSCs treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and the control group were 68.8 ± 4.82, 58.3 ± 4.49, and 41.3 ± 3.03 nm, respectively, and the exosomes isolated size from HFFF2 cells treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and the control group were 67.3 ± 4.80, 42.6 ± 3.04, and 35.5 ± 2.82, respectively in the DLS analyses (Figures S1 and S2; Table 1). Z‐potential of the isolated exosomes was found to be −21.8 and −21.3 mV, which indicates the stability of exosomes in hUC‐MSCs treated with Ole and HFFF2 treated with Ole, respectively (Figure S3).

          Western Blot Analysis
          In the western blot image, protein bands with a size of 26 kDa indicated exosome membrane protein CD63 (Figure 4A,B). The protein CD63 was present in the Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups in both the hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells. Furthermore, the presence of protein bands at 24 kDa implies the existence of the exosome membrane protein CD9, as depicted in Figure 4C,D. We detected CD9 protein in the hUC‐MSCs, HFFF2 cells, and control group.

        In Silico Analysis of microRNAs Related to Studied Genes
        In silico analysis was performed to determine and confirm the selection of microRNAs associated with the studied genes, as detailed in Table 2. Specifically, for the IGF1 gene, hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p were identified. The IGF1R gene was associated with hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p. The EGF gene was linked to hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p. For COL1A1, hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7d‐5p were confirmed. Lastly, hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p was associated with the ELN gene (Table 2).

          3.6.1
          The Relative Gene Expression Treated With Fe@C/Ole and Ole
          In the ANOVA test, significant differences were observed between the treatments (Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control) in the HFFF2 cells, in terms of the relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes (p ≤ 0.05). Also, in the hUC‐MSCs, there was a significant difference in the relative expression (p ≤ 0.05) of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A, and ELN genes between the treatments. In contrast to other genes, no significant difference was observed in the relative gene expression of EGF in the hUC‐MSCs between the treatments (Table S3).
          The HFFF2 cells exhibited significant upregulation in the expression of the IGF1 (fold change: 3.14), IGF1R (5.3), COL1A1 (2.11), ELN (3.17), and EGF (3.5) genes in response to Ole treatment compared to the control group. Additionally, Fe@C/Ole treatment upregulated the expression of the IGF1R (2.03), ELN (1.94), and EGF (2.76) genes compared with the control group; however, there were no significant changes in the IGF1 and COL1A1 genes in the Fe@C/Ole group compared with the control group (Figure 5A). This trend of gene expression changes was similar in hUC‐MSCs, although, as mentioned, the EGF gene was not significant, and, unlike the HFFF2 cells, the COL1A1 gene was upregulated in the Fe@C/Ole treatment (Figure 5B).

          The Relative Gene Expression in Exosome‐Treated HFFF2 Cells
          According to the qRT‐PCR data and analysis of variance, there was a significant difference between HFFF2‐derived exosomes and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control treatments in terms of the relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes (p ≤ 0.05) in HFFF2 cells (Table S4).
          The findings indicated that the relative expression levels of IGF1 (2.6, 6.14), IGF1R (3.02, 6.11), COL1A1(3.73, 4.25), ELN (2.5, 3.25), and EGF (4.06, 4.14) were strongly upregulated in the HFFF2 cells treated with HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes with Ole compared to the control group, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Also, the results showed that the relative expression levels of IGF1 (3.4, 5.62), IGF1R (3.9, 6.02), COL1A1 (2.24, 3.32), ELN (2.4, 3.4), and EGF (3.61, 4.12) were significantly upregulated in the HFFF2 cells after the treatment of HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes with Fe@C/Ole compared to the control group, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Overall, the effects of HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes were similar; however, the effect of exosome treatment on gene expression was more significant than that of direct treatment with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to the control group.

          The Relative microRNA Expression in the Content of Exosomes From Fe@C/Ole and Ole‐Treated Cells
          In the ANOVA, significant differences were observed between the treatments (Table S5). The results showed that hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs were significantly downregulated, whereas miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated in HFFF2‐derived exosome content, as well as in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosome content treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to the control (Figure 7A,B).

          The Relative Expression of microRNAs in HFFF 2 Cells Treated With Cell‐Derived Exosomes
          In the ANOVA test, significant changes were observed between the treatments (Table S6). The present study evaluated the amounts of different microRNAs in HFFF2 cells treated with HFFF2‐derived exosomes and in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes in comparison to the control. The results indicated that the hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs were downregulated in HFFF2 cells between the treatments. In contrast, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated between treatments in HFFF2 cells (Figure 8A,B).

          Expression Correlation of microRNAs

          Our investigation demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the expression levels of specific microRNAs in modified exosomal content and the associated alterations in HFFF2 cells treated with these exosomes. This finding supports the concept that exosomal miRNAs are conveyed to recipient cells and influence their gene expression.
          The study examined expression correlation of several microRNAs, including hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p, in HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to exosomes of HFFF2 cells that were treated with exosomes derived from these cells. Significant positive correlations were consistently observed for these microRNAs in exosomes and exosomes of HFFF2 cells, indicating a robust influence on HFFF2 cellular responses. These results highlight the critical role of exosomes in intercellular communication and the regulation of gene expression within recipient cells (Table S7).

        Results of Exosome Toxicity Investigation
        The Flow Cytometry analysis results showed no significant variations in the viability percentage between HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, or the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 9). Flow Cytometry analysis of cell death data, including late apoptosis and necrosis, revealed no significant differences between exosome treatments. However, the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole significantly increased early apoptosis (p ≤ 0.05); on the other hand, there were no significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in early apoptosis between the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Ole and the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 9).

            Flow Cytometry showed no significant difference between the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and the control in viability, late apoptosis, and necrosis, but in early apoptosis, it was seen that the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Olesignificantly increased.
          
          
        
        The Flow Cytometry experiment demonstrated no significant differences in the viability percentage between hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and the control group in the HFFF2 cells. In addition, Flow Cytometry analysis of cell death data, including early apoptosis and necrosis, revealed no significant differences in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Ole compared with the control. However, there was a significant increase in late apoptosis in the hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Ole compared to the control (p ≤ 0.05); on the other hand, there were significant differences in early apoptosis and necrosis in the hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole compared to the control in the HFFF2 cells. Also, in late apoptosis, there were no significant differences in the hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole compared to the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 10).

      Discussion
      Previous research has revealed that the IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways are involved in skin rejuvenation [34, 35, 36, 37]. For these signaling pathways, we selected to investigate growth factors and their receptors, including the IGF1, IGF1R, and EGF genes, as well as the COL1A1 and ELN genes, which are primarily involved in skin renewal. Conversely, microRNAs modulate gene expression in the skin aging process. Research has identified multiple microRNAs linked to skin aging, which also target our chosen genes, notably the hsa‐miR‐29, hsa‐miR‐34, and hsa‐let‐7 families [49]. Research has shown that IGF1 is regulated by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [39] and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [40]; IGF1R is targeted by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [41], hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [42], hsa‐let‐7d‐5p [43], and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p [43]; EGF is regulated by hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [44]; COL1A1 is targeted by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [45], hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [46], and hsa‐let‐7d‐5p [47]; and ELN is regulated by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [48].
      Aging causes an increase in MMPs and a reduction in Collagen (COL1A1) and Elastin (ELN) levels [50, 51]. Thus, enhancing the production of Collagen (COL1A1) and Elastin (ELN) can effectively mitigate the effects of aging and promote rejuvenation [51, 52]. This study revealed that Ole and Fe@C/Ole (slow release) treatments increased COL1A1 and ELN mRNA levels in HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs that support the hypothesis of skin rejuvenation through treatments, as MMP9 (nonreported) has the ability to degrade collagen and elastin. Results were anticipated given the proven efficacy of Ole in many signaling pathways, including IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K [13, 53]. The effect of Ole can be attributed to its antioxidant effects, as well as its influence on the expression of growth factors such as IGF1 and EGF [10, 54, 55]. Generally, in our study, Ole treatment upregulated the expression of IGF1, EGF, and IGF1R, but IGF1 was not significant in Fe@C/Ole treatment (Figures 5 and 6). To date, reports have shown that antioxidant treatments, such as Ole, quercetin, and resveratrol, increase the expression of IGF1, EGF, and IGF1R genes [56, 57].
      The nanocomposite structure can improve Ole's stability and activity by preventing degradation in biological fluids. This is crucial for maintaining therapeutic levels during treatment [58]. Ole's effect on enhancing these growth factors and their receptors has been examined by targeting the MAPK signaling pathway [53, 59], which supports the rejuvenation process by inhibiting MMPs and promoting the production of COL1A1 and ELN (Figure 11). Furthermore, previous studies have highlighted Ole's ability to activate the PI3K signaling pathway and its significant antioxidant effects [60]. This pathway is known for its antioxidant properties; by increasing the expression of antioxidant cascades within the cell's nucleus and mitochondria, it actively inhibits the aging process [61]. Additionally, reducing MMP activity and blocking inflammatory pathways—such as those involving prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), nitric oxide (NO), and interleukin 6 (IL‐6)—promotes the synthesis of collagen (COL1) and elastin (ELN) (Figure 11).

      In fact, our investigation involved treating HFFF2 cells with exosomes derived from both HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs, all of which had been pre‐treated with either Ole or Fe@C/Ole. This approach led to an observable increase in the expression of several key genes: IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF (Figure 11). This outcome aligns generally with findings from direct Ole therapy, with the notable exception of the EGF gene's response in hUC‐MSCs. Interestingly, whereas direct treatment of HFFF2 cells with Fe@C/Ole did not significantly alter the expression of IGF1 and COL1A1 and similarly for EGF and IGF1 in hUC‐MSCs, a significant upregulation was observed when these cells were instead treated with exosomes originating from HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs that had undergone Fe@C/Ole pre‐treatment. This suggests that the reduced toxicity of Fe@C/Ole when delivered via exosomes appears to have notably increased gene expression within the exosomes themselves, a significant improvement compared to direct application. Utilizing modified exosomal content offers distinct benefits over conventional treatments. Primarily, these modified exosomes do not trigger the body's antibody and antigen systems, thus avoiding an immune response. Secondly, their internal components are directly influenced by the initial treatment, as these exosomes are typically derived from living cells [22, 62]. Furthermore, both Ole therapy and Fe@C/Ole application substantially altered the makeup of the exosomes, leading to observable changes in their modified content. Exosomes also exhibit remarkable anti‐inflammatory properties, which contribute to accelerated healing, a reduced risk of EGF complications such as post‐inflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring, and improved results in photo rejuvenation by enhancing collagenases and promoting the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts [63, 64].
      On the other hand, this investigation focused on microRNAs linked to genes involved in the IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways. We assessed how Ole and Fe@C/Ole treatments affected the levels of exosomal microRNAs in HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs, given their known association with growth factors and genes critical for skin rejuvenation. The findings indicated that a 24‐h treatment influenced the expression levels of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs in exosomes. The changes in Ole and Fe@C/Ole treatments resulted in the downregulation of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs in exosomes derived from HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs. Downregulation of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs as interfering RNAs justified the upregulation of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF gene expression (Table 2). These observations were corroborated by the expression of the aforementioned genes within HFFF2 cells, subsequent to their treatment with HFFF2‐derived exosomes that had undergone pre‐treatment with Ole and Fe@C/Ole (Figure 6). This research demonstrates a clear alignment between the microRNA levels found within the exosomes and those present in the HFFF2 recipient cells influenced by these exosomes. Consequently, modified exosomal content, produced through Ole and Fe@C/Ole therapy, emerges as a practical substitute for directly treating cells. These tiny vesicles hold considerable benefits when compared to traditional topical facial applications, positioning them as a more effective therapeutic choice [65, 66].
      Unexpectedly, overexpression of hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p in exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole and also exosomes of HFFF2 cells that were treated with exosomes derived from these cells indicates a complex role in skin aging responses. It enhances skin repair by promoting cell turnover and healthier epidermal layers, regulates oncogene‐suppressing pathways to prevent skin deterioration, and induces apoptosis to clear damaged cells, supporting new cell generation. Additionally, it modulates genes vital for tissue repair, boosting collagen and elastin synthesis for improved skin youthfulness. These effects collectively enhance skin self‐renewal, underscoring its potential in antiaging research [67, 68, 69, 70].
      This study provides novel insights into the regenerative properties of modified exosomal contents, indicating that Ole and Fe@C/Ole in exosome‐based therapies hold great promise for skin rejuvenation. In addition, this study offers important insights into the effects of Ole and Fe@C/Ole on cellular mechanisms, and it is important to understand that the experiments were performed in vitro using cell lines. Applying these findings to in vivo conditions, such as human skin, could require more studies. The intricacies of the human body, including factors such as skin thickness and blood circulation, may affect the efficacy and potential side effects of Ole or Fe@C/Ole‐based treatments.

      Conclusion
      The research findings indicate that the use of modified exosomal content with Ole and Fe@C/Ole (slow release) treatment is a more effective method for transferring substances and biomolecules that are effective in the molecular mechanisms of skin rejuvenation than the use of effective substance treatment alone in vitro. This method can ultimately increase collagen and elastin gene expression while reducing interfering microRNAs in their respective genes.

Title: Rationale and design of the GLADE study: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in endometriosis-related pelvic pain

Abstract: AbstractBackgroundPelvic pain secondary to endometriosis is a disabling condition. There are multiple treatments available, with variable endpoints. No prospective controlled studies were carried out evaluating subdermal pellets of gestrinone in this population.MethodsOne hundred participants with documented deep infiltrative endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either gestrinone 85 mg subdermal bioabsorbable pellets or placebo. Both arms will receive levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12). The treatment duration will be 6 months, with baseline, 3 months and 6 months clinical visits. The primary endpoint is a combination of serious adverse events (SAEs) accumulated within 6 months of insertion of the gestrinone or placebo pellet and collected through spontaneous reports and clinical findings. They include death, threat or risk to life, need for hospitalization, prolongation of pre-existing hospitalization, permanent disability or damage, congenital anomaly; or significant medical occurrences such as venous thromboembolism. The primary safety outcome will be the percentage of patients who do not experience SAEs 6 months after randomization. Androgenization, changes in laboratory exams and in pelvic pain intensity as well as quality of life (SF-36 and EHP-30 questionnaires) will be further evaluated. Daily data on uterine bleeding patterns and the use of pain relief medication will be remotely collected using an App. Pharmacokinetics profile of gestrinone pellet will be characterized.ConclusionThis is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile of subdermal gestrinone pellets and might inform clinical practice for treating these patients.Administrative InformationGLADE trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05570786). This is an investigator-initiated research supported by Biòs Farmacêutica.

Body: Introduction
      Pelvic pain is a disabling condition for women of reproductive age, negatively impacting their quality of life and work efficiency. Doctors frequently neglect it despite its estimated worldwide prevalence ranging from 5.6 to 26.6 [1,2]. Pelvic pain is considered a symptom of multifactorial origin in which endometriosis is the leading gynecological cause that affects 5–10% of women in their reproductive years. It means around 176 million women with endometriosis worldwide [3].
      Surgical and hormonal treatments with variable endpoints are available and are still considered a significant challenge for medicine. Recommendations from different medical guidelines for managing the disease include surgery or a combination of surgical and pharmacological strategies [4–6]. Hormone therapy includes progestogens, anti-progestogens, combined oral contraceptives, gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, GnRH antagonists, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), danazol and aromatase inhibitors. The choice of treatment for endometriosis must consider the severity of the symptoms, extent, and location of the lesions, comorbidities, age, intention to become pregnant, adverse drug events, and contraindications. Surgical treatment is indicated in the case of severe and disabling symptoms without improvement after the pharmacological treatment. However, post-surgery recurrence rate of painful symptoms is 21.5% after 2 year and 40–50% after 5 years of the surgery [4–6]. The direct costs for treatment of endometriosis are significant. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in 2021 registered 26,400 medical appointments and 8,000 hospitalizations for endometriosis with limited access to multifunctional teams specialized in endometriosis and longtime waiting for a surgery [7]. In this context, pharmacological treatment for endometriosis is prominent.
      A Cochrane Review about progestagens and anti-progestagens for pain associated with endometriosis showed gestrinone as anti-progestogen (i.e. a substance that prevents cells from making or using progesterone) and one of the first drugs for the treatment of endometriosis and myomas [8]. Gestrinone acts centrally on the hypothalamic pituitary system by suppressing the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Both continuous progestogens and continuous gestrinone are effective therapies for the treatment of painful symptoms associated with endometriosis. There was no overall evidence of a benefit of one oral progestogen over another. However, this conclusion must be treated with caution due to the lack of placebo-controlled studies [8]. The World Endometriosis Society (WES) [5] and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) [6] guidelines discuss the use of gestrinone as a possible medication for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain. Gestrinone should be used for those whom other treatments have proven ineffective despite potential treatment-associated adverse effects [5]. However, there is still a lack of quality evidence from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.
      GLADE (Gestrinone peLlet AnD Endometriosis) Study is a decentralized, patient-centered, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical study to primarily evaluate the safety and tolerability of subdermal gestrinone bioabsorbable pellet in the treatment of pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis. With this study, we hope to advance the knowledge about gestrinone subdermal pellets, their possible side effects, pharmacokinetics profile and their ability to alleviate pain and improve quality of life of women with endometriosis.
      
        Gestrinone compound profile
        
          Physicochemical properties and pharmaceutical formulation
          3-ethyl-17-hydroxy-18,19-dinor-17α-pregna-4,9,11-trien-20-yn-one, known as gestrinone, ethylnorgestrienone or R-2323 is a synthetic derivative of 19-nortestosterone developed in 1960 originally as a contraceptive and has been studied as a treatment for leiomyoma and endometriosis [9]. It is a compound with the molecular formula C21H24O2 and a molecular weight 308.4.14.
        
        
          Mechanism of action
          The mechanism of action of gestrinone is complex and multimediated. It inhibits folliculogenesis and acts on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, preventing the increase in gonadotropins (FSH and LH) in the middle of the ovulatory cycle, causing estrogen inhibition, anovulation, and amenorrhea. It has an affinity for progesterone and estrogen receptors and a low affinity for androgen receptors while at the same time inducing a reduction in the expression of progesterone receptors [10]. It can reduce the production of SHBG (Sex-hormone binding globulin), which causes an increase in blood levels of free testosterone and progesterone, leading to the emergence of their androgenic effects [11].
        
        
          Metabolization and excretion
          After oral administration, gestrinone has a serum half-life of around 24 h, undergoing active hepatic metabolism essentially by hydroxylation, and its metabolic conjugates are eliminated through urine (40–45%) and feces (30–35%) [12].
        
        
          Side effects
          Most of the adverse effects of gestrinone are due to its androgenic activity and include acne, skin and hair seborrhea, mild hirsutism, edema, weight gain, voice changes, androgenetic alopecia, and clitoral hypertrophy. The drug showed an embryotoxic effect on animals, with a risk of androgenization of female fetuses. It reduces HDL concentrations, and it is recommended to monitor cholesterol and liver transaminase levels in hyperlipidemic patients and glucose levels in diabetic patients. Other effects related to inhibition of the pituitary-ovarian axis may include menstrual disorders and amenorrhea, hot flashes, sweating, breast reduction, changes in libido, vaginal dryness, and emotional fluctuations [13].
        
        
          Clinical evidence
          Previous clinical studies evaluating gestrinone and endometriosis are scarce. A study by Diaz et al. (1977) assessed the contraceptive effect of the subdermal gestrinone implant in Chilean women for 12 months, as well as the emergence of possible adverse events. The authors reported a potent inhibitory effect on fertility in patients, which was accompanied by an increase in transaminases and the appearance of acne, headaches, and hirsutism [14].
          Oral treatment with gestrinone (2.5 to 5 mg twice a week) induced improvement in symptoms associated with endometriosis without the need for daily administration of the drug, which is usually required in similar conservative therapies, representing an option for treatment of the disease. Furthermore, patients treated vaginally tend to have fewer androgenic adverse events such as acne, seborrhea, and weight gain than those treated orally [15].
          Worthington et al. (1993) evaluated the effects of oral gestrinone (1.25 and 2.5 mg twice a week for 6 months) on some metabolic parameters of women with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. The study concluded that the drug was effective in treating the disease without inducing any loss of bone density but caused unfavorable effects on serum lipids and lipoproteins that were reversed 6 months after the end of treatment [16].
          A randomized clinical study involving 43 women with endometriosis compared 6 months of treatment with gestrinone (5 mg per week) or buserelin nasal spray (300 µg every 8 h) with a 5-year follow-up and found that both treatments were effective in remitting endometriosis. There were reports of acne and vascular events such as edema and heaviness in the lower limbs in the group that received gestrinone [17].
          In 1996, The Gestrinone Italian Group Study compared oral treatment with gestrinone and leuprolide acetate for pelvic pain in women with endometriosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical study, concluding that both were equally effective. However, gestrinone did not affect the patient’s bone density despite inducing fluctuations in serum lipid values [18].
          Trials evaluating gestrinone in the form of a gel for vaginal application (Gestrinone Pentravan®) for the treatment of endometriosis have also been carried out and report positive effects of the drug in relieving refractory pain [19].
          Subdermal gestrinone bioabsorbable pellet could be a safe and effective alternative for treating endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and minimize adverse events observed with oral administration.
        
      
      
        Objectives
        
          Primary objective
          To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response.
        
        
          Secondary safety objectives
          To evaluate the potential for androgenization of the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response.
        
        
          Other exploratory objectives
          To compare the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet versus placebo pellet on participant satisfaction, change in pelvic pain intensity, use of pain relief medication, uterine bleeding pattern and quality of life. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of gestrinone will be characterized in a subgroup of participants.
        
      
    
    
      Patients and methods
      The report of this study protocol follow the SPIRIT (standard protocol items: Recommendations for interventional trials) 2013 guidelines [20].
      
        Study design
        The first participant was included on February 25th 2023 and the last patient last visit is estimated for April 2025. The laboratory analysis for measurement of gestrinone plasma levels are undergoing. We will carry a decentralized, patient-centered, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. The study will be conducted in 7 research centers in Brazil (hospital and clinics).
        The study protocol has several innovations to increase participant recruitment and retention such as the organization of disease awareness campaigns and the participation of a patient representative as member of the Trial Steering Committee. Participant representative provided information about the burden of the disease and the impact of the treatment through a patient perspective that enabled the inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in the study protocol. An App will be used to remotely collect diary registries about uterine bleeding pattern and use of analgesics for pain relief and other adverse events in real time. These protocol innovations are depicted in Figure 1.

        Participants eligible for the main stage of the study will be randomized into one of the treatment arms:Experimental: Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) and gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet (85 mg)Comparator: Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) Kyleena® levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and subdermal implant of placebo bioabsorbable pellet
        The insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) is necessary as a contraceptive method for all study participants. LNG-IUS (LNG-IUS 12) has been developed for up to 5 years of use with an average release rate of ∼12 μg/24 h over the first year [21]. Clinical assessments will be recorded at recruitment (baseline), 3 and 6 months after pellet insertion. Assessment of the primary outcome will be carried out 6 months after insertion of the gestrinone pellet.
        Participants will be invited to an extension phase (open-label) of the study to provide additional long-term safety data (EXT-PK). A subgroup of 15 participants at the end of 6 months of the main stage of the study who accept to participate in the extension phase will receive an insertion of a gestrinone pellet (85 mg), and the serum concentration of gestrinone will be monitored to characterize its pharmacokinetic profile (PK). Clinical assessments will be recorded at recruitment (baseline), 1, 3 and 6 months after pellet insertion. Blood sampling for PK study will be conducted.
        Bioabsorbable gestrinone pellets are produced and marketed by Biòs Farmacêutica following standardized procedures and current legislation. Pellets containing a placebo will be prepared under the same conditions as those containing the product ingredient. Biòs Farmacêutica will donate all pellets used in this study.

        Patients
        The study will enroll 100 women with refractory pain control who underwent surgery for endometriosis at least 3 months ago and who had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of deep infiltrative endometriosis. Eligible participants are women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis surgically treated with refractory symptoms, independent of pain intensity. .Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain includes dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain.
        Study participants have a medical history of indication for surgery as an option to reduce endometriosis associated-pain after having been failed to standard hormone treatment (combined hormonal contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists or GnRH antagonists). Surgeries were conducted to fully eliminate endometriotic lesions from both the posterior compartment and anterior compartment, as well as from bowel compartment whenever present.
        Detailed eligibility criteria are listed in Table 1.

      Study endpoints
      
        Primary safety outcome
        It is a combination of serious adverse events (SAEs) accumulated within 6 months of insertion of the gestrinone or placebo pellet and collected through spontaneous reports and clinical findings. The primary safety outcome will be the percentage of patients who do NOT experience SAEs 6 months after randomization.
        SAEs are unfavorable medical events that result in any of the following outcomes:DeathThreat or risk to lifeNeed for hospitalizationProlongation of pre-existing hospitalizationPermanent disability or damageCongenital anomaly; orSignificant medical occurrences that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may harm the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the other occurrences mentioned. In this study, the occurrence of thromboembolic events (such as, for example, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack) was pre-defined as a significant medical occurrence.
      
      
        Secondary safety outcomes [timepoints: pre-pellet insertion assessment, 3 and 6 months after gestrinone or placebo pellet insertion]
        The main secondary safety outcome will be defined as the number of participants who experience androgenization defined by:Hirsutism: defined by Ferriman-Gallwey Score ≥ 8Clitoromegaly: defined by Clitoral index ≥ 35 mm2Acne: defined by the IGA scale (Investigator’s global assessment) grade 5 – severe inflammatory acne dominates the area, and there are many comedones, pustules, papules, and cystic acneAlopecia with sequelae of scalp thinningDeepening of the voice
      
      
        Other secondary safety endpoints [timepoints: pre-pellet insertion assessment and 3 months after gestrinone or placebo pellet insertion]

        Exploratory efficacy endpoints [timepoints: pre-pellet insertion assessment, 3 and/or 6 months after gestrinone or placebo pellet insertion]
        Exploratory efficacy endpoints are defined as:Median participant satisfaction (ranging from 1 to 5, from very satisfied to very dissatisfied) – assessmentMedian intensity of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea assessed by the VAS scaleProportion of participants who used medication to relieve pelvic painMedian number of days that participant used medication to relieve pelvic painChange in uterine bleeding patternProportion of participants with a change in Health-related Quality of Life measured with the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey Form (SF-36)Average change in total score and score for each domain of the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey Form (SF-36)Proportion of participants with changes in the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP- 30 The Endometriosis Health Profile) scoreAverage change in the total score and the score of each domain of the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP- 30 The Endometriosis Health Profile)
      
      
        Other exploratory outcomes
        The pharmacokinetic profile of gestrinone will be characterized in a subgroup of participants (N = 15). The pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined: area under the curve (AUC(0-∞)), maximum concentration (Cmax), time until reaching maximum concentration (Tmax), and half-life (t1/2).
      
      
        Assessment of outcomes measures
        Outcomes measures will be assessed during each of the three study visits in the main study protocol (randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled stage), including a baseline visit (pre-treatment), a 3-month visit and 6-month visit. A trained team, including a gynecologist, will conduct the study in the outpatient setting in all study centers. Clinical assessments, monitoring of adverse events, evaluation of androgenization (hirsutism, clitoral index, acne, alopecia, and deepening of the voice), as well as pelvic pain intensity and quality of life assessed by SF-36 questionnaire will be evaluated at all the three study visits. Laboratory blood assessment will be conducted at the baseline visit and in the 3-month visit and include: complete blood count, liver and kidney function (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, urea, creatinine, and uric acid), lipid profile (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL) and blood glucose, coagulogram (PT and aPTT), and plasma hormone levels (total testosterone, free testosterone, and SHBG). Quality of life assessment by the EHP-30 questionnaire will be applied at the baseline visit and in the 3-month visit. Data on uterine bleeding pattern and use of medication to relieve pelvic pain will be remotely collected using and electronic diary available at the App used in the study protocol.
        Outcomes measures in the EXT-PK (open-label) will be assessed during each of the four study visits in which clinical evaluation, monitoring of adverse events, evaluation of androgenization, pelvic pain intensity and quality of life by SF-36 questionnaire will be conducted in each of the clinical visits, including baseline (pre-treatment), 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month after the insertion of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet. Blood sampling for PK study will be conducted: pre-insertion of the gestrinone pellet (predose); different times after insertion of the gestrinone pellet: +24h; 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168 days. Data on uterine bleeding pattern and use of medication to relieve pelvic pain will be remotely collected using an electronic diary established to be available at the App established to be used in the study protocol.
      
      
        Study procedures
        Participant-reported outcomes will be collected via the App used in the study protocol: Quality of Life 36-item Form Health Survey (SF-36); endometriosis health profile – Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30); diary to record the use of analgesics for pelvic pain and uterine bleeding pattern. On the first visit, access to the App will be provided to the participant; the participant will receive guidance on how to use the App, and baseline data will be collected. Following the study procedure schedule, participants will receive reminders through the App to record outcomes, and telephone contact will be made for those who do not complete the form regularly. At follow-up visits, participants will be retrained if they present difficulties in using it.
      
    
    
      Screening procedures
      
        Gynecological assessment
        A gynecological assessment will be carried out to check the conditions of the female reproductive tract and the suitability for the insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12). Furthermore, menstrual history, hormone use, pregnancy, and fertility history will be collected. A transvaginal ultrasound will be performed to assess the positioning of the device.
      
      
        Treatments
        
          Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12)
          The LNG-IUS 12 (Kyleena®) must be inserted in an outpatient setting by the investigator following the manufacturer instructions. After carrying out a gynecological examination to check the size and position of the uterus, the cervix should be visualized with the aid of a speculum, and the cervix and the vagina should be cleaned with an antiseptic solution. With the help of the sliding guide, the IUS inserter must be pushed to the bottom of the uterus to position the device.
        
        
          Insertion of the investigational product or subdermal bioabsorbable placebo pellet
          The investigator will conduct the procedure in an outpatient setting. After local anesthesia, a small incision (4–5 mm) will be made, through which the pellet will be inserted under the skin of the buttock using a trocar. It will be performed just after the insertion of the LNG-IUS 12, and the randomization procedure.
        
      
      
        Safety and efficacy endpoint assessments
        Suspected events and outcomes must be analyzed by the Clinical Events Classification Committee. Safety results should be indicated on the eCRF clinical status page and should be submitted for review.
      
      
        Laboratory evaluation
        Blood samples (total volume of 10 mL) will be collected through venipuncture from the participant in the following tubes: tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant to perform the blood count, tubes with separating gel (to evaluate biochemical parameters of liver and kidney function, hormonal and lipid profile) or citrate (to perform a coagulogram), observing a prior 8-hour fast. After separating the serum, dosages will be carried out using commercially available kits following the instructions specified by the manufacturer. The local laboratory will conduct the analyses using its protocols and equipment and following Biosafety Standards and Good Laboratory Practices.
      
    
    
      Assessment of androgenization
      
        Hirsutism
        The investigator will assess the degree of hirsutism. The participant should be instructed to suspend hair removal/waxing for approximately 14 days before each visit. The use of lasers for hair removal will not be permitted during the entire study period. To evaluate and quantify hirsutism, the modified Ferriman-Gallwey Scoring System will be used, which includes 9 body regions (excluding the legs and armpits) for access to hair growth, grading from 0 (no terminal hair growth) to 4 (extensive hair growth) in 9 locations. The total score ranges from 0 to 36, with a score greater than 8 considered a sign of androgen excess in Caucasian women. A score of 8 – 15 indicates mild hirsutism; above 15, moderate to severe hirsutism. For other ethnic groups, the amount of hair expected for each specific ethnicity must be considered [22].
      
      
        Clitoris measurement
        The investigator will measure the participant’s clitoris (portion corresponding to the glans) [23]. The size of the clitoris will be measured using a 15 cm plastic ruler. The Clitoridean Index will be considered as the product of the longitudinal diameter (in millimeters) x transverse diameter (in millimeters), considering clitoromegaly when these measurements are more significant than 6.5 and 4.4 respectively, and the Clitoridean Index greater than 35 mm2 [24]. Additionally, the participant’s clitoris corresponding to the part of glans + corpus will be measured and registered.
      
      
        Deepening of the voice
        A speech therapist will evaluate the participant’s vocal pattern using protocols and equipment validated by evaluating professionals. The participant’s voice will be recorded using a digital recorder for evaluation. The pattern observed on each visit will always be compared with that recorded during the initial visit (Basal) to detect possible vocal changes and, more specifically, the deepening of the voice.
      
      
        Assessment of the degree of acne
        The severity of acne will be assessed
        By using the IGA scale (Investigator’s global assessment) to be used by the trained researcher and described below:0 – Clear skin: no evidence of acne1 – Almost clear skin: some inflammatory lesions and some non-inflamed papules present (developing papules, without redness yet)2 – Moderately severe acne: some non-inflammatory lesions dominate the area with some pustules and papules (there are no cystic lesions)3 – Non-inflammatory acne dominates the area, and some inflammatory lesions can be found. There may or may not be a small cystic lesion in the area,4 – Inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions are more visible. There may or may not be some cystic acne lesions.5 – Severe inflammatory acne dominates the area. Many comedones, pustules, papules, and cystic acne will be present.
      
    
    
      Alopecia
      The investigator will assess the occurrence of alopecia according to the presence of rarefaction sequelae on the scalp.
      
        Uterine bleeding or bleeding-free days
        The participant must record in the electronic diary (App) whether there has been uterine bleeding in the last 24 h. If the answer is positive, she must inform us of the intensity of the bleeding (whether spotting or bleeding). Based on the data documented in the participant’s diary, the following parameters will be evaluated:Total number of days of amenorrheaTotal number of bleeding-free days in the reference periodTotal number of days of bleeding and spotting (escape)Total number of days with bleeding or spotting in the reference periodNumber of consecutive bleeding-free daysNumber of consecutive days without bleeding after starting treatmentTotal number of days with spotting (escape)Total number of days with spotting (escape) in the reference periodTotal number of days to cessation of bleeding after starting treatment
        The bleeding pattern will be classified according to the criteria of Belsey [25] described below: normal bleeding − 3 to 5 episodes of spotting or bleeding within 90 days; prolonged bleeding – more than 14 days of continuous spotting or bleeding within 90 days; frequent bleeding – more than 14 days of constant spotting or bleeding within 90 days; infrequent bleeding – less than 3 episodes of spotting or bleeding within 90 days; amenorrhea – no bleeding during the 90 days of the reference period.
      
      
        Assessment of changes in the intensity of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea based on the Visual Analogue scale (VAS/EVA)
        The study participants will receive a diagram based on the Visual Analogue Scale shown below to assess chronic non-cyclical pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. The VAS scale is standardized from 0 (no pain) to 10 (in centimeters) (the worst pain imaginable).
      
      
        Record of pre-study and concomitant medications
        At the screening visit, pre-study medication use will be recorded. The participant must record in the electronic diary through the App used in the study about the use of concomitant medications, especially for pain relief (analgesics).
      
      
        Assessment of patient-reported quality of life
        The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Form Health Survey (SF-36) measured health-related quality of life. Participants must respond to the SF-36 questionnaire. The SF-36 is a multidimensional questionnaire containing 36 items distributed into 8 components: functional capacity, physical aspects, pain, general health status, vitality, social and emotional aspects, and mental health. It has a final score that ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to the worst general health status and 100 to the best health status [26].
      
    
    
      Endometriosis health profile 30 (EHP-30)
      Participants must respond to the EHP-30 questionnaire. The EHP-30 is a self-report instrument that measures how endometriosis affects a woman’s health status and quality of life. It consists of a central questionnaire composed of 30 items that access 5 dimensions: pain, control and helplessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image; and a modular questionnaire with 23 items distributed across 6 scales: sexual relations, work, medical profession, infertility, relationship with children and treatment. Each scale is transformed into a score from 0 to 100, with the lowest score meaning a better quality of life [27].
      
        Patient satisfaction with treatment
        Participants must rate their satisfaction with the treatment by choosing one of the following alternatives presented in written form (ranging from 1 to 5): very satisfied, satisfied, not sure, dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied.
      
      
        Pharmacokinetic profile of gestrinone
        Blood sampling will be conducted at pre-insertion of the gestrinone pellet; different times after insertion of the gestrinone pellet: +24h; 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168 days
        A sensitive and specific high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated by a local specialized laboratory for the determination of gestrinone in human serum using nomegestrol acetate-d5 as an internal standard. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.05 ng/mL.
        The pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated: area under the curve (AUC(0-∞)), maximum concentration (Cmax), time until reaching maximum concentration (Tmax), and half-life (t1/2).
      
      
        Reports of pregnancy
        Participants should be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they become pregnant during the study. The investigator must report any pregnancy in study participants that occurs within 30 days of the last administration of the investigational product.
      
      
        Randomization and allocation concealment
        Participants will be randomized into one of the study arms in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with gestrinone or placebo, stratified by center. According to an electronically predefined randomization list, participants will be assigned to a treatment group (RedCap, version 11.0.3). Participants are randomly allocated to one of the study arms, and neither the investigator nor the study participants influence the allocation of participants to the groups (blinding).
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Statistical analysis will be carried out by researchers independently. Summaries by treatment group will be provided using appropriate descriptive statistics for all study variables. Descriptive statistics such as mean ± standard deviation median (minimum-maximum) will summarize continuous variables. Categorical variables will be summarized as the proportions of each category. Graphical data presentation can also be used to summarize data. The values of the scores and indices will be compared with the baseline values (baseline = pre-treatment) using the paired t-test and Wilcoxon test. Changes in laboratory measurements and other secondary outcomes will be compared with the paired Wilcoxon test. Unless otherwise indicated, all statistical tests will be interpreted at a nominal (i.e. no multiplicity adjustment) two-tailed significance level of 0.05 and all CIs at a nominal two-tailed 95% level. The safety and exploratory efficacy outcomes results will be used for analyses.
        The Intention-To-Treat (ITT) and Per Protocol (PP) population will assess all safety and exploratory efficacy endpoints. The ITT population consists of all randomized participants who received the subdermal implant. The PP population includes only participants who complete all research procedures and do not present significant protocol violations, including breach of inclusion criteria.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      Pelvic pain is of multifactorial origin, in which endometriosis is the leading cause. It is challenging to treat endometriosis and there are surgical and hormonal treatments available with variable endpoints. Post-surgery recurrence rate of painful symptoms is high and alternative hormonal methods are needed. Gestrinone is one of the clinical options to reduce endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, but data from clinical controlled trials, particularly with subcutaneous pellets, are scarce.
      This will be the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the safety of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet versus placebo in women with endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response. This is the first to thoroughly evaluate the possible benefits of such a novel gestrinone pharmaceutical formulation with low-dose levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12) and might improve clinical outcomes in this population.
      The study protocol has several innovations such as the participation of a patient representative as member of the Trial Steering Committee. Participant representative provided information about the burden of the disease and the impact of the treatment through a patient perspective that enabled the inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in the study protocol. The trial will use advanced technology for data collection to capture participant′s responses, as well as clinical and biological data. In addition, the study includes a variety of biochemical analyses, including an extension phase that will provide crucial information on the long-term use of gestrinone pellets and PK analyses by LC-MS/MS.
      Since it is a safety-focused study, the trial has an experienced and independent Data Safety Monitoring Board and Clinical Events Classification Committee to evaluate all possible events blindly.
      We acknowledge some limitations of the study. Given the possible 10% dropout rate, the sample size might be small. However, given that it is a safety-focused phase II study, results might serve as a basis for large clinical trials powered enough to conclude the safety and efficacy of gestrinone pellets in patients with pelvic pain due to endometriosis. Another limitation of the GLADE trial was not excluding concomitant adenomyosis at screening. There is a need for future studies to evaluate the efficacy of gestrinone with more precise endometriosis phenotype including concomitant adenomyosis.
      In addition, the target population of GLADE trial is women with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain refractory to surgical treatment, independent of the surgical approach. The potential heterogeneity concerning surgical approaches, preferences and techniques performed at multiple Brazilian centers of expertise in endometriosis will be equilibrated between treatment groups by electronic randomization. Further larger studies addressing the efficacy of subdermal pellet of gestrinone and the potential differences of this effect on anterior, posterior or bowel compartment as well as on adenomyosis would bring evidence of a therapeutic option for pelvic pain.
    
    
      Conclusion
      Gestrinone is used for the treatment of pain in women with endometriosis. Still, there is a lack of data from well-designed randomized clinical trials evaluating such a strategy using a subdermal pellet with a particular focus on safety. We expect the current study will provide high-quality evidence of therapeutic efficacy and foster future studies to further characterize subdermal pellets of gestrinone as a therapeutic option for endometriosis-related pelvic pain.

Title: Dysprosium, cerium, indium, yttrium, and lutetium as emerging contributors to oxidative stress in polycystic ovary syndrome

Abstract: To investigate the role of Dysprosium (Dy), Cerium (Ce), Indium (In), Yttrium (Y), and Lutetium (Lu) in relation to oxidative stress (OS) and their potential alterations in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) females. This case-control study included two groups: Healthy controls (50) and PCOS cases (56). Serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu were quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). OS was evaluated by measuring serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation was performed to investigate the correlation between rare earth elements (REEs) and OS markers and differences in correlation strength between the PCOS and control groups were assessed using Fisher’s z-test. PCOS subjects exhibited markedly higher concentrations of Dy, Ce, In, and Y than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The analysis of OS biomarkers revealed elevated MDA levels in the PCOS group, indicating enhanced lipid peroxidation, alongside significantly reduced antioxidant capacity (GSH and SOD) (P < 0.001). Pearson’s correlation demonstrated significant positive associations between higher Dy, Ce, and Y levels and increased MDA levels (P < 0.05). Additionally, a significant negative correlation was observed between In and Y and the antioxidant markers GSH and SOD (P < 0.05), with Ce also showing an inverse association with SOD (P < 0.05). Fisher’s z-test further confirmed significant differences in correlation strength between the PCOS and control groups for Dy-MDA (z = 2.01, P = 0.031), Ce-MDA (z = 1.78, P = 0.037), In-GSH (z = − 2.24, P = 0.025), and In-SOD (z = − 2.39, P = 0.017). Moreover, significant correlations were found between Dy and Y (r = 0.41, P = 0.003), Ce and In (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), Ce and Y (r = 0.53, P < 0.001), and In and Y (r = 0.70, P < 0.001), suggesting interconnected roles of Dy, Ce, In, and Y in PCOS. These findings point to a potential link between OS and REE exposure in the development of PCOS. They suggest that metal-induced oxidative damage could be a key contributor to its pathophysiology. The study underscores the need for deeper investigation into environmental factors affecting reproductive health and for identifying strategies to mitigate these risks in women with PCOS.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-10468-2.

Body: Introduction
      With the surge in technological and industrial progress, women’s health faces unprecedented challenges. The extensive use of metallic compounds in agriculture and domestic spheres has intensified exposure to various elements, raising significant concerns about their impact, especially on reproductive health. Rare earth elements (REEs), often known as ‘technology elements,’ are vital to the advancement of numerous high-tech fields, including consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones and computers) and sustainable energy technologies1–3. Although their distinctive chemical characteristics render them critical for such applications, growing environmental accumulation of REEs has raised concerns regarding their potential effects on human health, particularly in relation to reproductive disorders like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Environmentally, growing extraction, use, and disposal of these elements have led to their accumulation, with human activities contributing to their buildup in soil and water systems4–7. Human exposure to REEs is elevated due to their high mobility and ion-emitting properties, which allow them to easily enter ecosystems, accumulate in the food chain, and increase environmental exposure. As “emerging pollutants,” these elements remain largely unregulated, with limited monitoring and insufficient understanding of their toxic effects. Concerns about the health impacts of REEs are growing, particularly regarding their effects on reproductive health, including fertility and pregnancy outcomes8–11. Although studies on its reproductive toxicity are limited, evidence from animal models indicates that elevated doses may disrupt ovarian function and lead to embryotoxic effects. The adverse effects of REEs on reproductive function have been investigated in sea urchins, where exposure was shown to impair fertilization, disrupt redox balance, interfere with embryonic development, and alter the regulation of genes involved in embryogenesis12. Notably, some human studies have documented an increased risk of preeclampsia, neural tube defects, adverse IVF outcomes, spontaneous abortion, and premature membrane rupture with higher maternal REE levels13–16. More recently, an increased risk of pregnancy loss has been reported in women with miscarriage owing to increase in serum REE9–11. Metals like Dysprosium (Dy), Cerium (Ce), Indium (In), and yttrium (Y) and Lutetium (Lu), may pose a significant risk to reproductive health, due to their widespread use in modern technologies and potential toxicity1,17–19. A recent case–control study reported higher heavy metals in women with PCOS compared to controls, linking these alterations to metabolic dysfunction and environmental exposures19.
      PCOS is a complex endocrine disorder and a major cause of infertility in women globally17. The condition presents with irregular ovulation, excess androgens, and polycystic ovaries, though its underlying causes remain poorly understood20–22. While the etiology of PCOS is multifactorial, recent evidence suggests that environmental factors, including exposure to heavy metals and REEs, may contribute to its development23–25, however, underlying etiologies remain unclear. Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu are REEs that may have potential impacts on reproductive health. Presumably, they could induce oxidative stress (OS), and alter redox balance, potentially exacerbating conditions associated with PCOS13,26–28. Increased levels of these REEs can interfere with hormonal balance, affect ovarian function, and impair fertility. Oxidative damage resulting from REE exposure may alter reproductive processes like oocyte maturation and impair follicle development in the case of PCOS. While the full extent of their impact on human reproductive health remains under investigation, emerging research suggests that exposure to these REEs may contribute to reproductive toxicity and conditions such as infertility and PCOS. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to examine serum levels of selected rare earth elements - Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu in patients with PCOS. It seeks to explore the correlation between these elements and markers of OS, comparing PCOS patients with fertile controls. The reprotoxic effects of these five REEs are scarcely documented in pregnancy-related research involving humans, making them the subject of our study. By shedding light on these relationships, this research aims to provide new insights into how REEs may contribute to the development and progression of PCOS. The findings could have far-reaching implications for developing diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies, offering a deeper understanding of how environmental pollutants influence reproductive health and paving the way for targeted interventions. The study thus aims to estimate the serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu in women with PCOS and to assess the correlation between these REE levels and oxidative stress markers in PCOS patients compared to fertile controls.
    
    
      Result
      
        Participant characteristics
        This study revealed notable differences between women with PCOS and controls across clinical, and biochemical parameters. Among the participants, 52.8% were women with PCOS, while 47.1% served as controls. Sociodemographic characteristics showed no statistically significant variation across the study groups, as demonstrated by data from our prior study29. However, clinical features such as irregular menses (56%) and acne (60%) were significantly more prevalent among women with PCOS (P < 0.01).
      
      
        Biochemical profile and OS markers
        Biochemical assessments showed that fasting blood sugar (FBS) and HbA1c levels were markedly higher in the PCOS group than in controls (P < 0.001). Similarly, PCOS group exhibited significantly higher luteinizing hormone (LH) levels accompanied by increased triglyceride (TG) concentrations at P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 respectively (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). PCOS group exhibited a notable increase in MDA levels, a marker of lipid peroxidation, compared to controls (P < 0.001). Conversely, antioxidant markers such as GSH and SOD were significantly reduced in women with PCOS (P < 0.001).
      
      
         Rare Earth element levels
        REE levels differed significantly across the groups analyzed. Serum levels of Dy, was significantly higher in the PCOS group than in controls (P < 0.001), along with elevated levels of Ce, In, and Y, which were significant at P < 0.05. However, the levels of Lu remain insignificant between the two groups (Table 1).
      
      
        Correlation analysis between REEs and OS markers
        To assess the link between elevated REE levels and OS markers, Pearson’s correlation analysis was carried out (Table 2). In the control group, no significant associations were detected between REEs and OS markers. However, distinct patterns emerged in the PCOS group: (a) for MDA, positive correlations were observed with Dy (r = 0.29, p = 0.04), Ce (r = 0.30, P = 0.03), and Y (r = 0.33, P = 0.02) in PCOS subjects, while correlations in controls were weaker and nonsignificant. Fisher’s z-test indicated significant differences between groups for Dy (z = 2.01, P = 0.031), Ce (z = 1.78, P = 0.037), and Y (z = 1.90, P = 0.049) and (b) antioxidant Status: In and Y exhibited negative correlations with antioxidant markers-GSH and SOD (P < 0.05). GSH correlated negatively with In (r = − 0.30, P = 0.034), with a significant between-group difference (z = − 2.24, P = 0.025). SOD showed significant negative correlations with Ce (r = − 0.33, P = 0.02) and In (r = − 0.31, p = 0.02), with Fisher’s z-tests confirming significant between-group differences (z = − 1.90, P = 0.049; z = − 2.39, P = 0.017, respectively). These findings suggest altered associations between REEs and OS markers in PCOS compared to controls. In multiple testing correction, the raw P-values for markers (MDA, SOD, GSH, Dy) ranged from 0.000013 to 0.00042, indicating significant differences between PCOS cases and controls. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, markers with P-values < 0.00013 remained statistically significant. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction/False Discovery Rate (FDR) identified additional significant markers with P-values up to 0.045 (Supplementary Table 3). MDA and Dy remained significant after both Bonferroni and FDR corrections, showing strong associations. SOD and GSH were significant after FDR but only partially after Bonferroni correction. Lu was not significant by either method. Ce, In, and Y were significant only after FDR correction. This indicates that FDR correction might be better suited for detecting relevant findings in this exploratory study. The correlations that remain significant after multiple testing correction—especially after FDR adjustment can be considered statistically meaningful within the exploratory context of the study. Correlation plots for these relationships in PCOS cases are provided in Figs. 1, 2 and 3.

        Inter-Element relationships
        Table 3 displays the inter-element correlation analysis of REEs in the PCOS group. Y exhibited strong significant positive correlations with Ce (r = 0.53, P < 0.001), and In (r = 0.70, P < 0.001). Additionally, Y demonstrated a moderate positive correlation with Dy (r = 0.41, P = 0.003). Further, a strong positive correlation was observed between In and Ce (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), suggesting a notable relationship between these elements. Lu showed no significant correlations with other elements in the study, indicating weaker relationships in comparison to other pairs. In summary, significant positive correlations were primarily observed between Yttrium (Y), Indium (In), and Cerium (Ce), while the other element combinations showed weak or no significant relationships.

      Discussion
      The findings of this study uncover a critical link between REEs and PCOS, highlighting their potential role in disrupting redox balance and contributing to OS. Women with PCOS exhibited significantly elevated serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, and Y compared to healthy controls, alongside reduced antioxidant defenses and a shift toward oxidative dominance. These results emphasize the impact of environmental exposure to REEs on reproductive health and suggest OS-induced metal toxicity as a key factor in the pathophysiology of PCOS.
      This study provides a new perspective on the environmental and biochemical influences underlying PCOS. REEs, commonly used in various industrial applications have garnered attention for their potential health impacts. However, the toxicity and biological effects of REEs on human reproductive health have been poorly studied, particularly in conditions such as PCOS. This study suggests that environmental exposure to REEs may exacerbate OS, contributing to the reproductive challenges observed in PCOS. Among the REE-Lutetium (Lu), dysprosium (Dy), cerium (Ce), indium (In), and yttrium (Y) play essential roles in modern technologies. Lutetium is primarily used in high-performance catalysts for petroleum refining and nuclear medicine for cancer treatment30. Dysprosium is crucial in the production of high-performance permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and electronics, and also finds applications in lasers and nuclear reactors31. Cerium, being the most abundant REE, is used in catalytic converters for automobiles to reduce emissions, in glass polishing, and the manufacturing of batteries and fuel cells32. Indium, typically extracted from zinc ores, is widely used in the production of thin-film photovoltaic cells, LCDs, and semiconductors, as well as in solders and alloys33. Yttrium, though relatively abundant among REEs, is essential in producing phosphors for displays, superconductors, lasers, and cancer treatments. These elements are extracted from minerals like bastnasite and monazite and have become critical components in technologies such as electronics, renewable energy systems, and environmental applications34. The growing use of REEs has resulted in their accumulation in soil and water, raising concerns about environmental and health risks, particularly regarding their effects on reproduction and pregnancy35,36. High doses of In have been shown to impair ovarian function and exhibit embryotoxic effects in animal studies37. Yttrium has also been reported to accumulate in reproductive tissues, which may interfere with normal reproductive processes; however, its human health impact remains uncertain38. Elevated serum REE levels have also been linked to adverse reproductive outcomes, including poor in vitro fertilization success, spontaneous abortion, and premature membrane rupture39. These effects highlight the distinct cytotoxic profiles of individual REEs across species and underscore the variability in their toxicological impacts.
      This study expands on previous research by examining REEs in women with PCOS and their potential links to OS. Notably, serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, and Y were significantly elevated in the PCOS cases relative to controls at P < 0.05. These elevated REE levels were positively associated with increased lipid peroxidation, as indicated by higher MDA levels (P < 0.05), and negatively correlated with reduced antioxidant markers, including SOD and GSH (P < 0.05). The findings of the current study are consistent with previous studies22,40,41. Significant positive correlations between REEs (Dy, Ce, Y) and MDA, along with negative correlations with antioxidants (GSH, SOD), were observed only in PCOS patients. These associations differed significantly from controls, indicating that REEs may specifically contribute to OS in PCOS. This highlights a potential role of REE exposure in the disease’s oxidative pathophysiology. The significant correlations between REEs in the PCOS group: Dy and Y (r = 0.41, P = 0.003), Ce and In (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), Ce and Y (r = 0.53, P = 0.0006), and In and Y (r = 0.70, P = 0.0001, further suggests interconnected roles of Dy, Ce, In, and Y in PCOS. Our findings demonstrate significant alterations in OS markers in PCOS cases compared to controls. The use of multiple testing corrections ensured that the reported associations are unlikely to be false positives. The Bonferroni correction, while conservative, confirmed the strongest associations (MDA, Dy), whereas the Benjamini-Hochberg method allowed for the detection of additional markers (Ce, In, Y) that may be biologically relevant. Overall, correcting for multiple testing ensured the reliability of the findings, with both conservative and liberal approaches highlighting key differences in oxidative and elemental profiles of PCOS patients versus controls.
      Despite decades of research, the precise pathogenesis of PCOS remains elusive. While its underlying causes are still being investigated, emerging evidence highlights OS as a critical factor in its development. The augmented OS in PCOS can be traced back to several sources. This study postulates that exposure to REEs such as Dy, Ce, In, and Y may contribute to the onset or progression of PCOS through OS-mediated mechanisms. REEs are known to induce OS by disrupting the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant defense systems42. Elevated OS has been documented in the follicular fluid and serum of women with PCOS, highlighting their significant contribution to the pathophysiology of the condition23. Among these biomarkers, malondialdehyde (MDA), a stable end-product of lipid peroxidation has proven to be a reliable indicator of oxidative damage. Studies have reported a 47% increase in circulating MDA levels in women with PCOS compared to controls, underscoring the role of lipid peroxidation in the metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions characteristic of the disorder43,44.
      Cells defend against free radical damage using antioxidant systems, including enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. Of prime importance, Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a key enzyme that neutralizes ROS by converting superoxide anions (O₂⁻) into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). There is conflicting evidence regarding SOD levels in PCOS, with some studies reporting elevated levels, while others have found decreased activity in serum and follicular fluid45,46. Increased SOD activity protects against OS-induced damage, while decreased activity can lead to apoptosis and corpus luteum regression41. These interactions emphasize the importance of SOD in ovarian function and reproductive health. Imbalances between antioxidants and ROS in follicular fluid can impair oocyte quality, potentially causing abnormal ovulation and infertility, as observed in PCOS patients42. Another key molecule in defending against OS is Glutathione (GSH), a major non-enzymatic antioxidant crucial for neutralizing oxidants and maintaining cellular redox balance. In PCOS, GSH depletion is likely due to elevated oxidants47,48. Presumably, heavy metals exacerbate this depletion by binding to GSH’s sulfhydryl (-SH) groups, forming organo-metallic complexes that disrupt their antioxidant function and further impair cellular defense mechanisms49,50. The OS in PCOS cases observed in the current study aligns with previous evidences. REE exposure in sea urchins led to a marked increase in OS, along with impaired fertilization outcomes and increased developmental defects in offspring as reviewed by Martino et al..,202212. Likewise, studies on algae, including common cyanobacteria, have revealed that Yttrium exposure impairs the antioxidant defense system, leading to increased OS51. More recently, elevated levels of similar elements and impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms in PCOS patients have also been reported18,19,50. Together, these studies highlight the role of REEs in amplifying OS, potentially influencing reproductive health outcomes like those observed in PCOS.
      As reported in previous studies, elevated OS significantly compromises oocyte quality by inducing lipid peroxidation, which impairs maturation and increases the prevalence of immature oocyte25. Moreover, OS disrupts granulosa cell function, which is critical for follicular growth and steroid hormone production, resulting in anovulation, a hallmark of infertility in PCOS43. These disruptions not only impair follicle maturation but also alter the endometrial environment, further intensifying reproductive challenges in women with PCOS. In summary, REEs may worsen PCOS by triggering OS, disturbing endocrine function, and hindering follicle development, all of which contribute to the onset or exacerbation of the condition. To better understand the mechanistic role of REEs in PCOS pathophysiology, future studies should focus on both in vitro and in vivo models. Cellular experiments using ovarian granulosa cells or theca cells could investigate how exposure to elevated REEs affects oxidative stress pathways, mitochondrial function, and steroidogenesis, key processes altered in PCOS. Assessing changes in ROS generation, antioxidant enzyme activity, and expression of genes regulating inflammation and hormone synthesis would clarify direct cellular effects. Animal models of PCOS could be used to evaluate systemic impacts of REE exposure on reproductive and metabolic phenotypes, including hormonal profiles, follicular development, and insulin resistance. Additionally, exploring potential REE-induced epigenetic modifications might uncover long-term regulatory changes contributing to PCOS progression. Human studies incorporating longitudinal designs could assess whether environmental or dietary REE exposure correlates with PCOS onset or severity. Integrating multi-omics approaches, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, may reveal downstream molecular networks perturbed by REEs. Together, these approaches would provide comprehensive insight into how REEs influence PCOS development and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
    
    
      Conclusion
      This study highlights the potential role of REE-induced oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of PCOS. The observed trends point to the need for greater awareness of environmental pollutants in reproductive health. These preliminary findings open new avenues for exploring environmental contributors to PCOS and underscore oxidative stress as a potential therapeutic target.
      
        Limitations of the study:
        While this study is among the first to assess associations between REEs and oxidative stress in PCOS, it did not account for environmental or lifestyle confounders (e.g., diet, pollution, occupational or cosmetic exposure) that may influence REE levels and oxidative stress. The Bonferroni correction, while conservative, confirmed the strongest associations (MDA, Dy), whereas the FDR method allowed the detection of additional markers (Ce, In, Y) that may be biologically relevant but require validation. Future studies should explore the clinical implications of these markers and validate the borderline findings.

          Women who met at least two of the following criteria were included in the PCOS group: (a) hyperandrogenism, (b) polycystic ovarian morphology, or (c) experiencing oligo- or amenorrhea, characterized by less than 8 menstrual cycles within a 12-month period. These cases were screened based on the Rotterdam criteria52.
        
        
          Control group:
          Healthy females without any symptoms of hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, infertility, or ultrasound findings suggestive of PCOS.
        
        
          Exclusion criteria:
          Patients on lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications, pregnant women, and those with diabetes, anemia, cancer, infections, thromboembolism, stroke, or ischemic heart disease were excluded.
        
      
      
        Sample collection and baseline characteristics
        Approximately 5 mL of blood was collected from each participant after obtaining written informed consent. The blood was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm to isolate the serum, which was then stored at −80 °C until further analysis to preserve its integrity. Baseline characteristics were assessed using an autoanalyzer, with the Mediserv 3700/Cell Dyne (STA Compact) and Roche Elecsys 2010 (Modular Analytics E170-Cobas e 411) for relevant tests.
      
      
        Detection of oxidative stress
        
          Lipid peroxidation (Malondialdehyde- MDA assay):
          MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were quantified using the MDA Assay Kit (ab118970; Abcam). A standard curve was created with MDA concentrations ranging from 4 to 20 nmol/well or 20–100 µM. The assay measures the formation of MDA-TBA adducts at 532 nm, with a sensitivity of > 0.1 nmol/well. MDA levels were reported in nmol/ml.
        
        
          Antioxidant markers (GSH and SOD):
          Glutathione (GSH) levels and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity were assessed using the Glutathione Assay Kit (CS0260; Sigma) and the SOD Assay Kit- Water-Soluble Tetrazolium salt; WST (19160; Sigma), respectively. In the GSH assay, the formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB), resulting from the reduction of 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), is monitored by measuring its absorbance at 412 nm, with GSH levels expressed in mg/ml. For SOD activity, absorbance at 450 nm was measured after incubating the samples with Water-Soluble Tetrazolium salt (WST) and enzyme working solutions at 37 °C for 20 min. SOD activity was reported in IU/ml.
        
      
      
        Quantification of REE
        Once thawed, serum samples were centrifuged to remove cells, resulting in clear serum. A volume of one milliliter of sera was diluted with a solution of 0.5% nitric acid and 0.01% Triton X-100 to ensure the elements remained dissolved and stable. Subsequently, levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu were measured using the Perkin Elmer NexION 2000G ICP-MS. Certified reference materials (CRMs) with a concentration of 1000 ppm were employed for calibration, and serum metal levels were quantified in parts per billion (ppb). A calibration curve was established with working standards covering 0.025 to 100 ppb. Each standard concentration was measured three times, and a multi-point linear regression was used to correlate signal intensity with concentration. To enhance measurement accuracy and reduce matrix effects, a constant amount of germanium (Ge) was added as an internal standard to all serum samples. The resulting calibration curve exhibited excellent linearity, with a coefficient of determination (R²) exceeding 0.999. LOD values for each element were calculated by assessing the distinction between blank sample signals and background interference, with detection limits as low as 0.025 ppb, reflecting the high sensitivity of the ICP-MS instrument. The method demonstrated strong reliability, with measurement accuracy ranging from 0.3 to 22.8% and precision between 0.8% and 11.8%.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Data analysis was conducted using Sigma Plot version 12. About 56 PCOS cases and 50 healthy controls were initially recruited; statistical analyses were conducted on 50 participants in each group. Six PCOS samples were excluded due to poor sample quality or missing data, resulting in a final sample size of 100 (50 per group) for all comparisons and correlation analyses. The exact number of data points used in each analysis was consistent. The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed the normality of paired differences, allowing the use of paired t-tests for comparison of measured variables. Pearson’s correlation was performed to examine associations between REEs and OS markers. Differences between correlation coefficients in the PCOS and control groups were assessed using Fisher’s z-transformation followed by a two-tailed z-test. To account for the issue of multiple hypothesis testing, P-values were adjusted using both the Bonferroni correction and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (FDR). For Bonferroni correction, the significance threshold was set at P < 0.003. For the FDR, adjusted P-values were evaluated at a significant level of 0.05. Scatter plots were used to visualize correlations between REEs, MDA, GSH, and SOD.

Title: The PCOS Phenotypes in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study: participant clinical features and data harmonization on analysis of individual participant data

Abstract: BackgroundPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifaceted condition with diagnostic challenges and clinical heterogeneity across populations. Research priorities include enhanced accuracy in defining cut-offs for diagnostic features. Here, we aim to describe participant clinical features and data harmonization in the international PCOS Phenotype in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study.MethodsWe searched EMBASE and Medline (Ovid) from 1990 to October 2, 2020, in population-based, medically unbiased study cohorts. Included studies had ≥ 300 participants, directly assessed PCOS-related features, and provided Individual Participant Data (IPD). Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS tool. Data integrity was ensured via cross-referencing, identifying outliers/implausible data, and variable harmonization. Reporting follows PRISMA-IPD guidelines, summarizing findings with frequencies and proportions.ResultsThe study included 9979 reproductive-age women from 12 studies across eight countries (China, Iran, Italy, Nigeria, Russia, South Korea, Turkey, and the USA), representing 11 ethnicities. Ovulatory dysfunction was variably recorded, from mean menstrual cycle length, minimum or maximum cycle length, number of cycles per year, or urinary progesterone measurements. Clinical hyperandrogenism was assessed via modified Ferriman–Gallwey (mFG) scores, with a few also including acne and alopecia. Biochemical hyperandrogenism thresholds varied (95th, 97.5th, or 98th percentile of healthy controls). Polycystic ovary morphology was assessed via transvaginal, transabdominal, or transrectal approaches. Harmonization adhered to International PCOS Guidelines for ovulatory dysfunction, ethnicity-specific cut-offs for hirsutism (via k-means clustering), and 95th percentile thresholds for biochemical hyperandrogenism. PCOS prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 19.8% in the original studies and was 11.0% overall after harmonization.ConclusionsThe P-PUP study offers an unprecedented, ethnically diverse, medically unbiased population-based cohort, an extraordinarily valuable tool to enhance knowledge and research in PCOS. However, variability in data collection methods and definitions of PCOS diagnostic features across studies limited the ability to fully integrate data for analysis. Despite these limitations, we optimized harmonization in this IPD, and the findings provided valuable insights into the challenges of data harmonization and established a foundation for future collaborative research. Future research should focus on standardizing data collection, establishing normative cut-offs based on true natural groupings, and linking diagnostic clusters to outcomes in diverse populations.Protocol registrationCRD42021267847.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12916-025-04221-9.

Body: Background
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrinopathy with significant long-term reproductive, metabolic, dermatological, and psychological health impacts [1]. According to the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines criteria, diagnosis in adults is based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: (1) oligo-/anovulation (OA); (2) clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA); and (3) either polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound or elevated serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels [2–5]. In adolescents, the diagnosis requires both OA and HA [2–5]. It is estimated that 10–13% of women worldwide are affected by PCOS, and the global incidence is reportedly increasing, making PCOS a major public health concern [2–6]. PCOS and its associated health implications generate substantive health [7, 8] and economic burdens for individuals, societies, and governments [9–12].

      Despite increasing research and publications on PCOS [13], the pathogenesis remains unclear and there are significant persisting challenges in diagnosis. This is attributable to its multifaceted and heterogeneous clinical presentation, the lack of gold-standard diagnostic tests, ethnic variation, and the fact that most studies are carried out in medically biased (clinically based) populations [14–19]. It is also due to the multiple components of the diagnostic criteria, which are all continuous variables [20–22], the paucity of data on normative cut-off thresholds for each diagnostic component within unselected, diverse populations [23, 24], and the use of arbitrary diagnostic cut-offs across studies [25–31]. This contributes to delayed or inaccurate diagnosis of PCOS, hindering timely and appropriate interventions to limit complications and treat the condition [12, 32–35].
      These challenges underscore the importance of consolidating data from diverse populations for a more comprehensive understanding of the condition [16]. While traditional systematic reviews and meta-analyses represent an improvement over single-center studies, they are limited by aggregated data from original studies with varying methodologies, sample sizes, and study populations. Conversely, the PCOS Phenotype in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study, is a large-scale, international individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis designed to address identified challenges, allowing harmonization of raw data from individual studies, standardization of cut-offs and analyses across studies and examination of individual-level variables to advance knowledge on PCOS etiology, diagnosis and clinical features in unselected community-based populations [36].
      This report on the P-PUP study aims to (a) outline the selection criteria and study identification process for the study, (b) describe the clinical features of the populations included, and (c) detail the data harmonization process for PCOS diagnostic criteria and features within the study.
    
    
      Methods
      
        Protocol and registration
        The protocol for the P-PUP study was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021267847) and published previously [36]. This study was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of Individual Participant Data guideline [37].
      
      
        Selection of studies
        The methodology for the selection and identification of research groups and collaborators has been described previously [36]. In summary, a systematic search of the EMBASE and Medline (Ovid) databases, along with a manual Google search, was conducted from 1990 to October 2, 2020, to identify eligible unselected population-based cohort studies. Key search terms included PCOS, ovulatory dysfunction (OD), hirsutism, polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM), and unselected populations, among others. A full search strategy for Medline (Ovid) is in Additional file 1: Table S1. The PCOS research community (RA and HJT) was consulted to identify any potentially ongoing or unpublished studies.
        Cross-sectional or longitudinal cohort studies were considered eligible if they were published after 1990 (after a change in diagnostic criteria), included a sample size of 300 or more unselected women of any age, ethnicity, or weight, and directly assessed features related to PCOS [36]. These features of PCOS included measurement of ovulatory dysfunction, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. No language restrictions were imposed. Studies that relied on self-reported or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for PCOS status without the assessment of PCOS features were excluded. Exclusion criteria at the participant level included pregnant and lactating women, women with natural/surgical menopause, ovarian pathology, and women meeting the criteria for exclusion of other conditions in the diagnosis of PCOS. Additionally, women receiving contraceptive hormonal treatment within 3 months of assessment were excluded from the androgen analysis.
        Titles and abstracts were initially screened by a single reviewer (SK), and then full-text articles were retrieved and assessed in duplicate (SK and ADB) with any discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer (HJT). The corresponding and/or lead authors of the identified studies were contacted and requested to contribute to deidentified IPD for integration and analysis. For authors who did not respond, two reminder emails were sent.
      
      
        Data collection processes
        Data and relevant dictionaries were transferred to the ISO 27001-certified Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) [38] which restricts access and control to the authorized data custodian and researchers. The key variables collected aligned with the PCOS core outcomes set [39] and included sociodemographic factors (age and race/ethnicity); generic outcomes (weight, height, body mass index (BMI)), metabolic outcomes (waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profiles, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose (FBG)); dermatological (hirsutism as measured by modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG score) and reproductive outcomes (androgen assays, menstrual cycle length, number of menstrual cycles per year, age of menarche, and PCOM features including antral follicle count (AFC) and ovarian volume (OV)). Any data discrepancies or concerns were discussed and resolved with the original study investigators.
      
      
        Risk of bias assessment
        We evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies providing IPD using the AXIS appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies [40]. The appraisal was conducted by two independent reviewers (ADB and RRD), and any discrepancies were resolved through consensus. This tool consists of 20 items that assess various aspects such as the study’s aim, design, sample size, outcome variable measurement, statistical methods, response rate, result consistency, discussion and conclusion, limitations, and ethical approval, with responses categorized as “yes,” “no,” or “don’t know” [41]. Overall quality was rated as low (score 1-7), medium (score 8-14), or high (score 15-20) [41].
      
      
        Data harmonization and analysis
        Data synthesis involved rigorous procedures to ensure data integrity and harmonization across diverse datasets. All laboratory measurements were standardized to the International System of Units (SI) for consistency. Outliers were identified using scatter plots and box plots, applying a criterion where values exceeding > 5 or > 10 standard deviations were flagged [42]. Invalid or implausible data points, such as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) surpassing systolic blood pressure (SBP), and height < 120 cm were identified, based on consensus clinical judgment and predefined criteria. Definitions of outliers, invalid data points, and rules for variable harmonization were documented and collaboratively discussed with original study investigators to achieve consensus on data handling (Additional File 1: Table S4).
        For the harmonized definition of PCOS, we adhered to the International PCOS Guideline criteria, requiring two of three key features: OD, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. The specific criteria for each feature were defined as follows:◦ OD: Menstrual cycles numbering fewer than eight or exceeding 17 per year, and/or cycle lengths shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days.◦ Clinical hyperandrogenism: Defined by hirsutism quantified through the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) scoring system. We analyzed ethnic distribution patterns of mFG scores using descriptive statistics of means and medians. Subsequently, we standardized the data (mean = 0, SD = 1) and performed a k-means cluster analysis (k = 2), with cluster determination guided by the average silhouette method, following our previously published methodology [43].◦ Biochemical hyperandrogenism: Defined using study-specific 95th percentile cut-offs for first-line androgen tests (TT, FT, cFT, and FAI), supplemented by secondary markers (A4 and DHEAS) when first-line tests yielded negative results. This approach accounts for variations in assay methods and reference ranges across studies.◦ Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM): Given the considerable heterogeneity in imaging modalities, ultrasound approaches, and absence of individual participant data (IPD), harmonization of PCOM data proved unfeasible; thus, we relied on each study's original definitions and categorizations for this criterion.
        This study undertook a one-stage approach for analysis and only included women of reproductive age between 18 and 45 years. Continuous variables were reported as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), as appropriate for the distribution of data. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and proportions. Available case analysis was employed, and we did not opt to undertake multiple imputations for any missing data because they could not be random. Stata 18 software was used for data management and analysis.

        Study characteristics and risk of bias
        The literature search identified 6507 publications, from which 1437 duplicates were removed. After screening the titles and abstracts, 342 studies underwent full-text review of which 313 studies were excluded (Additional File 1: Table S2). Finally, 29 studies met the eligibility criteria and their authors were contacted. Of these, the authors of 19 studies, encompassing 31,580 participants, did not respond. Of the 10 authors who responded, seven expressed willingness to collaborate and completed the data-sharing process, whereas three studies involving a combined total of 17,439 participants were unable to do so [44–46]. Additionally, two ongoing studies were identified through other researchers, and two authors contributed more than one study from different populations. The entire P-PUP study dataset encompassed 12 population-based medically unbiased representative cohorts [26, 31, 47–56] and 12,513 participants drawn from PCOS research groups spanning eight countries internationally (Fig. 1). A detailed assessment of the included studies’ methodological quality appraisal is presented in Additional File 1: Table S3. All of the included studies had a low risk of bias (high quality) [26, 31, 47–56].Fig. 1PRISMA IPD flow diagram for P-PUP study selection
        Table 1 presents the characteristics of the final included studies. The entire P-PUP study dataset included studies from China (n = 2; 4645 women) [48, 52], Iran (n = 3; 2517 women) [49, 53, 54], Italy (n = 1; 519 women) [50], Russia (n = 1; 2695 women), South Korea (n = 1; 499 women) [26], Turkey (n = 1; 392 women) [51], the USA (n = 2; 806 women) [55, 56], and Nigeria (n = 1; 440 women) [47]. All studies were cross-sectional in design with sample sizes ranging from 392 to 3000.

        Participant selection after data harmonization
        Of the total 12,513 participants in the P-PUP study, 2046 were excluded due to missing data on age (n = 6), age < 18 years (n = 609), age > 45 (n = 1178), natural/surgical menopause (n = 81), current pregnancy/lactation (n = 40), and ovarian pathology (n = 48). Additionally, 488 participants were excluded due to abnormal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH > 25 IU/L), prolactin (> 67.2 µg/L), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP > 30 nmol/L), or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH > 5 µU/mL) (Fig. 2, Additional File 1: Table S4). A total number of 9979 participants was included in the final analysis following data harmonization. The predominant ethnicities represented in reproductive-age women were 40.1% Asian Han Chinese, 23.8% White Iranians, and 9.5% White Russians (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Flow chart for study participant selection. Note: TSH, prolactin, and 17-OHP were not consistently collected across the total populations in the studies, as some studies collect the data on women suspected of having PCOSFig. 3Ethnicity distribution of the study participants
      
      
        Assessment of ovulatory dysfunction
        All studies collected information on ovulatory dysfunction (OD) through the assessment of menstrual cycles, but the data collection methods were heterogeneous. Four studies collected data about OD in categorical form [48, 52, 55, 56], with differing cut-offs: fewer than 21 days, 21–35 days, or greater than 35 days [52]; 35 days or less or greater than 35 days [56]; less than 26 days and greater than 35 days [55]; and another reported it as a binary with regular (21–35 days) or irregular (fewer than 21 days, greater than 35 days or irregular bleeding) [48]. Six studies collected actual menstrual cycle length [26, 31, 47, 49, 53, 54], seven studies collected the number of menstrual cycles per year [31, 47, 49–51, 53, 54], and one study recorded the minimum and maximum menstrual cycle lengths, in addition to the overall menstrual cycle length [31]. One study also reported minimum and maximum cycle lengths and cycle numbers per year in addition to the categorical menstrual cycle status, with nearly 60% missing data [48]. Except for one study [31] which had 4% (62/1550) missing data, the remaining studies provided complete data on OD (Additional file 1: Table S5).
        The definitions of OD varied across studies and are summarized in Table 1. Most studies defined OD based on menstrual cycle length or the number of menstrual cycles per year, with some including progesterone levels to further assess ovulation status. OD was most commonly defined by using an upper limit of menstrual cycle length greater than 35 days [31, 47–49, 52–56], with another study using a threshold of greater than 34 days [51]. The lower limit for menstrual cycle length also varied, with three studies using less than 21 days [31, 48, 49, 53], one study using less than 24 days [51], one using less than 26 days [55], and another one using less than 25 days [47]. For the number of menstrual cycles per year, four studies defined OD as less than eight menstrual cycles per year [26, 31, 47, 52], while two studies used the cut-off of fewer than nine cycles per year [55, 56]. Additionally, three studies incorporated a lack of menses for three consecutive months as part of their OD definition [26, 49–51, 54, 55]. Mid-luteal progesterone level was utilized by three studies as part of their assessment of OD [51, 54, 55]. The reported prevalence of OD in the included studies ranged from 9.2 to 31.9%, with an overall aggregated prevalence of 18.2%. For data harmonization, we defined OD as fewer than eight or more than 17 menstrual cycles per year and/or a menstrual cycle length of less than 21 days or greater than 35 days, in alignment with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines [2–5]. Based on this definition, the prevalence of OD across the included studies ranged from 3.7 to 31.9%, with an overall prevalence of 15.3% (Table 2).

        Assessment of clinical hyperandrogenism
        All included studies assessed clinical hyperandrogenism, using hirsutism as a primary criterion [26, 31, 47–56]. Hirsutism was assessed directly by a health professional, including gynecologists, midwives, physicians, nurses, endocrinologists, and general practitioners using the mFG score. Hirsutism was defined by an mFG score of 6 or higher in six studies [26, 47, 48, 51, 55, 56], 8 or higher in five studies [49, 50, 52–54], and 5 or higher in one study [31].
        All studies reported acne [26, 31, 47–56], with nine providing IPD [26, 47, 49, 50, 52–56], and three incorporating acne into their definition of clinical hyperandrogenism [48, 52, 54]. One study employed the Burke-Cunliffe acne grading method, assessed by a physician [50]; six studies employed the standard acne lesion assessment of the face, back, and chest, assessed by gynecologists, midwives, physicians, and general practitioners [31, 47, 49, 52–54]; two studies mentioned that no specific acne scoring system was used, with assessments conducted by nurses [55, 56], while another two studies did not provide details on the acne scoring tools used, with assessments conducted by physicians [48, 51]. One study used self-reported acne without a specific scoring system [26]. Among studies that included acne in their clinical hyperandrogenism definition, a score of two or higher was used in one study [52], six or higher in another [54], and the cut-off was not specified in one study [48].
        Six studies reported on the presence of female pattern hair loss (FPHL) [31, 47, 50, 52, 54, 55], with four providing IPD [47, 50, 54, 55], and two incorporated FPHL into their definition of clinical hyperandrogenism [50, 54]. The presence of FPHL was assessed by gynecologists, physicians, nurses, and general practitioners using the Ludwig scale in three studies [31, 50, 52], while three other studies provided no details on the FPHL assessment tool used [47, 54, 55]. FPHL was reported in a categorized form in two studies with no cut-offs provided [50, 54].
        For data harmonization, we defined clinical hyperandrogenism using hirsutism only in alignment with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines which highlights hirsutism as the strongest predictor of hyperandrogenism. We used ethnicity-specific mFG score cut-offs derived from k-means (k = 2) cluster analysis in our recent publication [43]. The thresholds were set at mFG score ≥ 8 for Iranians, ≥ 7 for White Italians and Black Africans, ≥ 5 for Asian Han Chinese, White Russians, Turkish, and Black Americans, and ≥ 4 for White Americans, Asian Koreans, Asian Russians, and Mixed Russians [43]. Based on these cut-offs, the prevalence of clinical hyperandrogenism ranged from 8.1 to 34.2% in individual included studies, with an overall aggregate prevalence of 14.2% (Table 3).

        Assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism
        Biochemical hyperandrogenism was assessed in all included studies except for one study done in Nigeria [47]. Seven studies assessed all participants [31, 48–51, 53, 56], three studies [26, 54, 55] assessed selective subgroups, and the remaining one study collected blood samples from a random half of the population [52]. Among the studies that assessed androgen levels in selective subgroups, Tehrani et al. assessed only participants with either hirsutism (mFG score ≥ 8) or menstrual disorder (26% of the sample, 260/1000) [54]; Azziz et al. assessed only participants with menstrual dysfunction (48.7% of the sample, 189/388) [55]; and Kim et al. assessed participants who consented to provide blood samples (32.1% of the sample, 160/499) [26].
        Of the included studies, 11 reported total testosterone (TT) [26, 31, 48–54, 56], seven reported calculated free androgen index (FAI) [26, 31, 49, 51–54], eight reported androstenedione (A4) [49–56], and nine reported dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) [26, 31, 49–51, 53–56]. The assay method used included enzyme immunoassay (EIA) [49, 53, 54], liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) [31, 50], chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) [31, 51, 52], radioimmunoassay (RIA) after extraction [55, 56], and RIA [26, 48, 51, 55, 56] (Table 1). Three studies reported free testosterone (FT) [48, 55, 56]: two reported calculated FT (cFT), derived from TT measured by an in-house RIA after serum extraction and SHBG binding activity by equilibrium dialysis using Sephadex G-25 and [3H]T as the ligand, and approximations for binding to albumin [55, 56], while one study reported directly measured FT utilizing RIA [48].
        Biochemical hyperandrogenism was defined using the selected control subgroups as above 95th percentile in eight studies [26, 49, 51–56], above 97.5th percentile in one study [50], above 97.7th percentile (equivalent to 2 standard deviations above the mean in normally distributed data) in another study [48], and above 98th percentile in one study [31] (Table 1). The prevalence of biochemical hyperandrogenism varied widely across studies, ranging from 5.6 to 30.0%, with an overall prevalence of 17.4%. In this study, we adapted the 95th percentile cut-off specific to each study for harmonization to account for variations in assay methods and reference ranges across studies. We used first-line tests (TT, FT, cFT, and FAI) and second-line tests (A4 and DHEAS) when first-line tests were negative, as per the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines. This approach revealed a biochemical hyperandrogenism prevalence ranging from 11.0 to 30.3%, with an overall prevalence of 20.4%. The overall prevalence remained nearly the same at 20.2% when studies assessing selective subgroups of populations were excluded (Table 4).

(2011); the original authors did not use these androgens in their classifications. Additionally, we calculated the 95th percentile for TT in Gambineri et al. (2013). The reported laboratory values were converted to the SI unit using the following conversion factors: for A4 3.49 from ng/mL to nmol/L and 0.00349 from pg/mL to nmol/L; for TT 3.47 from ng/mL to nmol/L and 0.0347 from ng/dL to nmol/L; for FT 0.003467 from pg/mL to nmol/L and 0.03467 from ng/dL to nmol/L; for DHEAS 0.00271 ng/mL to µmol/L and 0.0271 µg/dL to µmol/L. For data harmonization, we utilized the 95th percentile cut-off specific to each individual study population, applying first-line tests (TT, FT, and FAI) and incorporating A4 and DHEAS when first-line tests were negative, in accordance with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines
      
      
        Assessment of polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM)
        Eight included studies assessed all participants for PCOM. One study provided PCOM as a binary variable [49], OV data was provided by six studies [26, 31, 47, 48, 51, 52], while AFC was provided by seven studies [26, 31, 47, 48, 51–53]. The imaging modalities used included transvaginal ultrasound with a band frequency ranging from 5 to 13 MHz, and transabdominal ultrasound with a band frequency ranging from 1 to 9 MHz. Additionally, transrectal ultrasound was utilized in two studies [26, 52]. Unfortunately, the IPD in the included studies did not specify the ultrasound approach, either transvaginal, transabdominal, or transrectal.
        Except for Makwe et al. which defined PCOM as having an AFC count of ≥ 20 and/or OV ≥ 10cm3 [47], all other included studies used older criteria, defining PCOM as having an AFC count of ≥ 12 and/or OV ≥ 10cm3 [26, 31, 48, 49, 51–53]. The reported prevalence of PCOM varied widely across studies, ranging from 6.6 to 39.9%, with an overall prevalence of 19.2% (Table 5). Due to the heterogeneity in imaging modalities, ultrasound approaches, and lack of IPD, data harmonization for PCOM was not feasible, and thus we relied on each study’s original definitions and categorization.

        Prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
        Of the included study, eight defined PCOS using the Rotterdam criteria [26, 31, 47–49, 51–53], while the remaining four used the National Institutes of Health (NIH 1990) criteria and did not include ultrasound data for PCOM [50, 54–56]. The reported prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 19.8%, with an overall prevalence of 11.7% using each study’s original definition. For data harmonization, we defined PCOS by applying the International PCOS Guidelines criteria, requiring two out of three key features: OD, hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. We defined OD as fewer than eight or more than 17 menstrual cycles per year and/or a menstrual cycle length of less than 21 days or greater than 35 days; we defined hyperandrogenism as either clinical (limited to ethnicity-specific hirsutism scores) or biochemical (using study-specific 95th percentile cut-offs for first-line androgen tests, supplemented by secondary markers when first-line tests were negative), in accordance with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines recommendations. Post harmonization, the prevalence of PCOS ranged from 3.3 to 18.3%, with an overall prevalence of 11.0% (Table 6).

Secondary causes that may mimic PCOS, such as hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, and non-classical adrenal hyperplasia, were excluded
      
    
    
      Discussion
      The P-PUP study represents the first international IPD-based meta-analysis involving unselected (medically unbiased) women from the general population, assessed for PCOS features, offering a unique and diverse cohort to explore PCOS characteristics across heterogeneous populations. This comprehensive dataset includes a large sample size of 9979 women aged 18–45 years from 11 primary ethnicities, eight countries and four continents. Our analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in data collection methods and the definitions used for PCOS diagnostic features, particularly in the assessment of ovulatory dysfunction. This variability contributed to a wide range of reported prevalence of PCOS across original studies, from 3.3 to 19.8% (11.7% overall). After data harmonization, the PCOS prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 18.3%, with an overall prevalence of 11.0%.
      Ovulatory dysfunction (OD) is a key component in the International Guidelines PCOS diagnostic criteria, focused on menstrual cyclicity, and irregular cycle length and number per year. The International PCOS Guidelines [2–6], defined irregular cycles as > 90 days for any one cycle in women 1-year post menarche, < 21 or > 45 days in women one to less than 3 years post menarche, < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year in women 3 years post-menarche to perimenopause, while acknowledging the need for further research [57]. We identified significant variations in menstrual cycle data collection, especially prior to the International PCOS Guidelines. Categorical and continuous data was collected, including average cycle length in days, average cycle number per year, minimum and maximum cycle length and cycle number per year. OD cut-offs were variable across studies. Here, we harmonized OD data aligned with Guideline recommendations, reporting a prevalence of 3.7% to 31.9% or 15.5% overall. Future studies should collect standardized continuous data on cycle length (in days) and cycle number per year, with clear explanations of cycle length as the number of days from the first day of one period to the first day of the next, to limit confusion with the duration of menstrual bleeding. While acknowledging the inherent variability of cycles in PCOS and limitations of self-reported data for large-scale epidemiology studies, standardized data collection and definitions would substantially minimize error while ensuring consistency and comparability across studies. The International PCOS Guideline’s OD cut-offs were derived from the 95th percentile of menstrual cycle duration, based on variable control populations which likely included women with PCOS [58]. Using this percentile as a diagnostic cut-off, particularly when it is not linked with clinical outcomes, including anthropometric outcomes (weight, waist-hip circumference, BMI), reproductive outcomes (androgens, ovulation frequency, pregnancy complications), and cardiometabolic (insulin resistance, lipid profiles, blood pressure, fasting glucose), represents a crude and overly simplistic approach [58]. Moving forward, applying advanced analytics including cluster analysis to define cut-offs based on well-defined unselected populations and clinical correlates such as association with other PCOS features or with long-term outcomes is a research priority captured in the International PCOS Research Road Map [59].
      Hyperandrogenism is an essential PCOS diagnostic feature and manifests clinically as hirsutism, acne and androgenic alopecia. Acne and androgenic alopecia are relatively nonspecific markers of hyperandrogenism, particularly in PCOS [2–5, 16]. While validated scoring systems exist for acne and androgenic alopecia, these are not universally agreed upon for PCOS due to limited research in PCOS populations, ethnic variations, and clinical contexts. In included original studies, acne and alopecia were inconsistently reported, with variable tools and definitions. In contrast, hirsutism is strongly correlated with biochemical hyperandrogenism and is the most reliable clinical sign of hyperandrogenism in PCOS [60, 61]. The modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) visual scale is Guideline recommended [62] and was used in all included original studies. Historically, a cut-off mFG score of ≥ 8 defined hirsutism in PCOS, based on a misinterpretation of original Ferriman and Gallwey data at the 95th percentile of a predominantly white population [63, 64]. In P-PUP IPD we established ethnicity-specific mFG cut-offs via k-means cluster analysis, with cut-offs ranging between 4–6 for the majority of populations [43]. This aligns with the International PCOS Guidelines recommendations for an mFG score of 4–6 to diagnose hirsutism [2–5]. Clinical hyperandrogenism ranged from 6.8 to 28.4% (13.7% overall) in original studies with variable mFG cut-offs and use of acne and alopecia. With cluster analysis cut-offs and data harmonization, we report a prevalence of 8.1% to 34.2% (14.2% overall) and aligned to Guidelines, cluster-defined mFG cut-offs are recommended.
      Biochemical hyperandrogenism in PCOS focuses on elevated free testosterone, which may be measured directly or calculated primarily through FAI and cFT. Our recent systematic review and meta-analysis informed the International PCOS Guidelines recommendation to use TT and FT as a first-line laboratory test for biochemical hyperandrogenism [65] using LC–MS/MS methods with the best accuracy [66, 67]. In the P-PUP study, only two original studies used LC–MS/MS [31, 50], all others relied on less specific and sensitive immunoassay. Cut-offs for biochemical hyperandrogenism varied, with arbitrary thresholds at the 95th, 97.5th, or 98th percentile of healthy controls. In P-PUP we adapted the 95th percentile cut-off for androgens specific to each study to harmonize data reporting a prevalence from 11.0 to 30.3% in original studies, with an overall prevalence of 20.4%. Further cluster analyses are underway to refine definitions and address persisting limitations.
      PCOM is evaluated using pelvic ultrasonography and is characterized by either ovarian enlargement, measured as increased OV, and/or an excess of small antral follicles, either within the entire ovary (FNPO) or a single cross-sectional image (FNPS) [68]. Cut-offs for OV and FNPO vary by ultrasound technology and approach. The 2023 International PCOS Guidelines recommend the transvaginal ultrasound approach, FNPO ≥ 20 in at least one ovary or OV ≥ 10 ml to define PCOM in adults. If older ultrasound technology is used, the AFC count is ≥ 12 in at least one ovary. PCOM is not recommended in adolescents as it lacks specificity [2–5]. In the present analysis, only one study adhered to these recommendations and transabdominal and transrectal ultrasound approaches were also used, with no validated PCOM cut-offs, limiting harmonization and resulting in the retention of original study definitions. Guidelines now clearly recommend a transvaginal ultrasound, and cut-offs for FNPO and OV which need to be applied, along with the inclusion of AMH measurements.
      
        Strengths and limitations
        This study has several strengths. Firstly, this IPD is unique and includes a large diverse, international IPD set, with generalizability to those with PCOS. Unselected participants also minimize selection bias, as seen in clinic-based cohorts. Also, the IPD analysis allowed standardization of definitions and cut-offs across studies and aligned with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines to minimize heterogeneity and enhance comparability. Limitations include heterogeneity in data collection methods, particularly for ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. Some original data could not be harmonized, affecting the comparability of results across populations. Most original studies relied on immunoassays for androgen measurement, which are less accurate than LC-MS/MS. Most studies also used older ultrasound technology and variable approaches and lacked sufficient methodological detail, with reliance on original study PCOM definitions. Although serum AMH is now recommended as an alternative marker for PCOM, this data was not available. Lastly, although the study included participants from four continents and eight countries, including participants from diverse ethnic backgrounds enhanced generalizability, notable geographic and cultural gaps in representation persist, underscoring the need for more globally comprehensive PCOS research.
      
    
    
      Conclusions
      The P-PUP study brings together an unprecedented cohort of ethnically diverse, unselected population-level data to enable research and advance knowledge in PCOS. In integrating this IPD we have shown a lack of standardized data collection methods across original studies. Cut-offs for PCOS diagnostic features also vary, jeopardizing diagnostic accuracy and consistency and impacting data harmonization. This work directly addresses the high research priorities identified in the PCOS Guidelines research roadmap, which emphasizes creating international data repositories and standardizing research approaches [59]. Future research efforts should prioritize the standardization of data collection methods that align with the International PCOS Guidelines and PCOS core outcome sets [39], while simultaneously refining definitions and establishing accurate normative cut-offs for individual PCOS diagnostic features. These diagnostic thresholds should be based on cluster analysis and natural groupings, identifying diagnostic clusters that are linked to short and long-term outcomes in medically unbiased, unselected, and diverse populations. This dual approach to standardization would facilitate big data integration and the development of machine learning–driven models for precision medicine in PCOS.

Title: Multiomics analysis revealed the regulatory role of chenodeoxycholic acid in fatty acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis

Abstract: ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the regulatory role and mechanisms of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on lipid metabolism, and to evaluate its therapeutic potential in lipid metabolism-related diseases such as acne, seborrheic alopecia, and prostate cancer, with the aim of identifying safer and more sustainable treatment alternatives.MethodsLipid-overproduction models were established using RM-1 (murine prostate cancer cells) and primary sebaceous gland cells, stimulated by linoleic acid (LA) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), respectively. CDCA’s mechanisms were explored using transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics. In vivo validation was conducted via intradermal injection of CDCA into the sebaceous gland area of golden hamsters to assess its effect on sebaceous lipid metabolism.ResultsCDCA significantly reduced intracellular lipid accumulation in both murine prostate cancer cells (RM-1) and primary sebaceous gland cells, and suppressed the expression of the androgen receptor (AR), along with the downregulation of key lipogenic enzymes (SREBF1, FASN, FADS2). Mitochondrial membrane potential was restored in CDCA-treated cells. Multi-omics analyses revealed that CDCA modulated fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation, energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPAR-γ) signaling. Lipidomic profiling demonstrated a shift from saturated to unsaturated fatty acid dominance after CDCA treatment. In vivo, CDCA decreased sebaceous lipid accumulation and downregulated PPAR-γ expression in golden hamsters.ConclusionCDCA exerted multifaceted regulatory effects on lipid metabolism, hormone signaling, and mitochondrial dynamics. These effects contributed to the maintenance of sebaceous gland homeostasis and supported the development of innovative and potentially more biocompatible therapies for lipid-related disorders.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02656-w.

Body: Introduction
      Lipid homeostasis refers to the state in which organisms maintain the balance of lipid levels, encompassing multiple aspects such as fatty acid metabolism. As fundamental units of lipid metabolism, fatty acids play pivotal roles in critical physiological processes including energy supply, cellular membrane structure, and signal transduction [1–3]. However, dysregulation of lipid metabolism is closely associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases, particularly in cancer and dermatological disorders. For instance, in prostate cancer, aberrant lipid metabolism not only contributes to tumorigenesis but also correlates with malignant progression and therapeutic resistance [4–6]. In dermatology, disrupted lipid metabolism is implicated in acne and seborrheic alopecia. Excessive lipid accumulation drives acne pathogenesis, while abnormal lipid metabolism may alter the follicular microenvironment in seborrheic alopecia [7, 8]. Thus, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of lipid homeostasis is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and developing novel therapeutic strategies.
      Bear bile, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely utilized for its heat-clearing, detoxifying, liver-soothing, and vision-improving properties. Ancient texts such as the Xiao’ er Weisheng Zongwei Lun Fang (Compendium of Pediatric Health and Refined Prescriptions) documented the use of “Xiongdan Shexiang Wan” (Bear Bile and Musk Pill) to treat pediatric malnutrition syndromes, stating: “For treating pediatric malnutrition syndromes, abdominal distension, pica, and persistent fever” [9]. The term “malnutrition syndromes” in modern contexts may correlate with metabolic disorders, including malnutrition and digestive dysfunction, both linked to lipid metabolism. Studies indicate that bear bile powder improves lipid profiles by reducing total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) while elevating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels [10–12]. Furthermore, clinical research demonstrates that bear bile-containing formulations and bear bile powder itself exhibit efficacy in managing lipid metabolism disorders such as hyperlipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [13, 14]. These findings highlight bear bile’s potential in modulating fatty acid metabolism and maintaining lipid homeostasis.
      Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), the primary bioactive components of bear bile powder [15–17], have shown therapeutic promise in metabolic disorders. Both bile acids improve hepatic function, regulate cholesterol metabolism, and mitigate inflammation, with established clinical applications in NAFLD and primary biliary cholangitis [18–20].
      However, despite this growing recognition, the potential of CDCA in regulating fatty acid metabolism outside hepatic contexts—particularly in tumor biology and dermatological lipid disorders—remains largely unexplored.
      In particular, the roles of CDCA in sebaceous lipid metabolism and its molecular targets in prostate cancer and sebaceous glands have not been systematically elucidated.
      Addressing this gap may offer new insights into the extrahepatic functions of bile acids and contribute to the development of novel metabolic therapies for skin and cancer-related disorders.
      Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of CDCA in modulating fatty acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis in both prostate cancer and sebaceous gland models. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics, the study sought to elucidate the molecular pathways involved and identify potential therapeutic targets of CDCA in the context of cancer and dermatological lipid disorders.
    
    
      Materials and methods
      
        Cell culture of RM-1 and primary sebaceous gland cells
        RM-1 cells (CL-0198, Procell Life Science & Technology, Wuhan, China) and primary sebaceous gland cells (CTCC-280-HUM, Meisen Cell Technology, Hangzhou, China) were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37℃ with 5% CO2. Humidity was maintained by placing 3000 mL of sterile distilled water in the incubator to prevent medium evaporation. RM-1 cells were cultured in DMEM medium (SH30022.01, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (PSA). Primary sebaceous gland cells were maintained in specialized epithelial cell medium (CTCC-009-613, Meisen Cell Technology, Hangzhou, China), composed of basal medium, 10% FBS, 1% epithelial cell growth supplement (ECGS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells within passages 4–8 were used for experiments. Routine subculturing was performed when cells reached 80% confluency.
        STR profiling confirmed that the sebaceous gland cells were of human origin, consistent with the supplier’s documentation. In addition, immunostaining for keratin 7 (KRT7)—a cytoskeletal protein expressed in epithelial lineages including sebaceous cells—was used to further support their identity (Supplementary Material 3). All STR authentication results are provided in Supplementary Materials 1–3.
      
      
        CCK-8 assay
        RM-1 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in culture medium. Cell suspensions (8,000 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ until adherent. Cholic acid (CA, 81-25-4, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), deoxycholic acid (DCA, 83-44-3, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), UDCA (128-13-2, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and CDCA(474-25-9, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were diluted in serum-free medium to concentrations of 0–500 µmol/L. After 24 h of treatment, 10 µL of CCK-8 solution (CK04, Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) and 90 µL of serum-free medium were added to each well. Plates were gently shaken to ensure uniform distribution and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Cell proliferation rates were calculated as:
        Cell viability (%) = [(Experimental group– Blank control) / (Negative control– Blank control)] × 100.
      
      
        Nile red staining for lipid detection
        RM-1 and primary sebaceous gland cells in the logarithmic phase were seeded into 96-well plates (8,000 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. Groups included: normal control, LA-treated (0.1 mmol/L for RM-1; 0.0125 mmol/L for primary sebaceous gland cells), and LA combined with CA/DCA/UDCA/CDCA. After 24 h of treatment, cells were exposed to 20 µg/mL dihydrotestosterone (DHT, D413176, Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) for 48 h. Medium was discarded, and cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min each). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (50 µL/well, 20 min), washed with PBS, stained with Nile Red (7385-67-3, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) (50 µL/well, 20 min, dark), and washed again. Triton X-100 (0.5%, 50 µL/well, 5 min) and DAPI (5 min) were sequentially applied. Fluorescence was visualized using an inverted microscope (CKX41, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
      
      
        Mitochondrial membrane potential assay
        Cells were treated for 24 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with 1 mL mitochondrial membrane potential probe (JC-10) staining working solution (CA1310, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) at 37 °C for 20 min. JC-10 staining buffer (1×) was prepared by diluting 5× stock with distilled water (1:4) and stored on ice. After incubation, cells were washed twice with 1× buffer and observed under a fluorescence microscope.
      
      
        qPCR analysis of lipid metabolism genes in RM-1
        Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (15596018, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), reverse-transcribed with ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix (FSQ-201, TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), and quantified. qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Premix (PK-201, TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) in 20 µL reactions (95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles). GAPDH served as the reference gene. Relative mRNA levels were calculated via the 2^−ΔΔCt method. The PCR primer (Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Material 4.
      
      
        Western blot analysis
        After 24 h of treatment, cells were harvested for protein extraction. Protein lysates were normalized based on concentration, mixed with loading buffer, and denatured at 100 °C for 10 min. Approximately 20–40 µg of protein (in a volume of 5–15 µL) per lane was separated by SDS-PAGE at 200 V. After the bromophenol blue front reached the gel bottom, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against fatty acid synthase (FASN), sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), and Histone 3 (all diluted 1:1000). Notably, the anti-FASN (A19050), anti-FADS2 (A24354), and anti-Histone 3 (A4835) antibodies were obtained from Abclonal Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China), while the anti-SREBF1 antibody (14088-1-AP) was purchased from Proteintech (Rosemont, IL, USA). The next day, membranes were washed thrice with TBST (10 min each) and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by further TBST washes. Signal detection was performed using ECL reagents and visualized on a ChemiDoc imaging system (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA).
      
      
        Multi-Omics profiling
        
          RNA-Seq
          Cell samples from RM-1 were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground, and lysed in 1 mL of pre-chilled Trizol. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Next, 200 µL of pre-chilled chloroform was added, mixed vigorously, and allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature. Following another centrifugation, the aqueous phase was collected, mixed with an equal volume of pre-chilled isopropanol, and incubated for 10 min. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed with 1 mL of 75% ethanol, briefly air-dried (3–5 min), and resuspended in 20–50 µL of 0.1% DEPC-treated water. The total RNA was then used for mRNA enrichment, fragmentation, cDNA synthesis, adapter ligation, and subsequent sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq Xplus platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data analysis—including read alignment, expression quantification, differential expression analysis, and KEGG enrichment using the Python SciPy package—was performed. Please refer to Supplementary Material 5 for details.
        
        
          Fatty acid metabolomics
          primary sebaceous gland cells samples (300 µL per sample, diluted 2×) were stored at − 80 °C. A mixed standard solution of 50 common fatty acids was prepared at 2000 µg/mL and further diluted using a 50% acetonitrile–isopropanol solution. Isotopically labeled internal standards were also prepared. Fatty acids were extracted using acetonitrile and isopropanol to ensure efficient recovery. Quantification was performed using UHPLC-MS/MS (AB SCIEX ExionLC™ AD system coupled with a QTRAP® 6500 + mass spectrometer) in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Standard curves generated from known concentrations were used to determine sample concentrations, with statistical analyses performed using Microsoft Excel and appropriate statistical software.
        
        
          Deep data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics
          Proteins from primary sebaceous gland cell samples were extracted and analyzed using an Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer in a DIA workflow. This method enables simultaneous collection of fragment data from all precursor ions, providing enhanced coverage and reproducibility compared to data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Quantitative analysis was conducted using DIA-NN software with retention time calibration via internal peptide standards. Differentially expressed proteins were defined as those with expression changes greater than 1.2-fold or less than 0.83-fold and a P-value < 0.05. Functional annotation and enrichment analyses were carried out using the COG, GO, and KEGG databases, and protein–protein interaction networks were constructed to elucidate biological functions.
        
      
      
        Golden hamster model
        Three SPF-grade golden hamsters (average weight ~ 120 g, 8 weeks old) were procured from Beijing Weitong Lihua Experimental Animal Technology Co., Ltd. and housed in the Animal Experimental Facility of the Institute of Basic Theory, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (License No. SCXX (Beijing) 2021-0006). The animals were maintained under controlled environmental conditions (temperature 20–24 °C, humidity 40–60%, 12-hour light/dark cycle, with adequate ventilation, standardized feed, and ad libitum water). The hair on the sebaceous gland regions of both sides of the abdomen was removed prior to experimentation. The experimental group received subcutaneous injections of a CDCA injection solution in the right-side sebaceous gland region, prepared per 2 mL as follows: 2 mg CDCA, 18 mg benzyl alcohol, 2.84 mg disodium hydrogen phosphate, 8.76 mg sodium chloride, 2.86 mg sodium hydroxide, and injection water, with pH adjusted to 8.3 as needed using hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. The control group was administered an equivalent volume of blank control solution. Injections were given daily for six consecutive days, and data were recorded at various time points.
      
      
        Dermatoscopic data acquisition
        Following induction of anesthesia with isoflurane, the dorsal hair of the golden hamsters was removed using depilatory cream and thoroughly washed with physiological saline. Once the skin was dry, a medical electronic dermatoscope (CH-DSIS-2000, Chuanghong Medical Technology, China) equipped with a 20× lens was placed in close contact with the skin. The focus was adjusted until a clear image of the sebaceous gland region was obtained, and parameters such as gland size and pigment deposition were recorded.
      
      
        Oil red O staining
        Frozen Sect. (10 μm thick) of the sebaceous gland region were prepared and fixed in 10% formalin for 30 min. Sections were then rinsed twice with distilled water (3 min each), treated with 60% isopropanol for 20–30 s, and stained with an improved Oil Red O staining kit (G1261, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) for 10–15 min. After brief differentiation with 60% isopropanol (5–10 s) and a distilled water rinse (1 min), Mayer’s hematoxylin was applied for 1–2 min. The sections were then washed, air-dried, and mounted with glycerol gelatin. Lipid droplets appeared in shades of orange-red, while nuclei were stained blue.
      
      
        Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining
        Paraffin Sect. (4 μm thick) were deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to staining with an HE staining kit (G1120, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China). Sections were stained with hematoxylin for 2 min, rinsed under running water for 10 min to achieve “blueing,” briefly differentiated with an acidic solution for 10 s, and subsequently stained with eosin for 20 s. After thorough rinsing, the slides were dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and mounted with neutral gum for optical microscopy image acquisition.
      
      
        Immunofluorescence staining
        Frozen Sect. (10 μm thick) from the sebaceous gland region were equilibrated to room temperature and washed three times with PBS (3 min per wash). After blocking with 5% goat serum at room temperature for 1 h to prevent nonspecific binding, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against Ki67 (dilution 1:200) and Cytokeratin 5 (K5, dilution 1:200) (27309-1-AP and 66727-1-Ig, respectively, from Proteintech, Wuhan, China). The following day, sections were washed three times with PBS, incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody (1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h, and finally mounted with DAPI-containing fluorescence mounting medium. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence imaging was performed using a touchscreen microscope (RVL2-K2, Echo Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA) with high-resolution objectives (4x–100x oil) and multi-wavelength LED excitation. Standard fluorophore filter sets (e.g., DAPI, FITC, TRITC, Cy5) were used, and images were captured with a 5 MP CMOS camera (2448 × 2048 pixels). Acquisition and processing were controlled via Revolve software, enabling automated exposure, focus, and filter selection.Image analysis was performed on three independent biological replicates. For each replicate, four images were captured under consistent exposure settings. Two images were averaged to generate one data point, resulting in six statistical values per group (n = 6). This design ensures both data representativeness and statistical reliability.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        All images were analyzed using ImageJ software (Version 1.8.0, NIH) with standardized protocols. Immunofluorescence intensity was quantified by threshold-based methods (auto-threshold algorithm combined with negative control calibration) to calculate integrated density. Oil Red O staining was processed via RGB color thresholding (Hue 0–30, Saturation 50–255) to determine lipid droplet-positive area percentage (%Area). Prior to analysis, uniform background subtraction and region of interest (ROI) delineation were performed.
        Data were statistically evaluated using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Initial tests for normality (Shapiro–Wilk) and homogeneity of variances (Levene’s test) were performed; if assumptions were violated, non-parametric tests or variance adjustments were applied. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni or Tukey post hoc tests for multiple comparisons. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

        Regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism in RM-1 cells
        
          Effects of different bile acids on RM‑1 cell viability and LA-induced lipid accumulation: CDCA’s potent inhibitory effect and concentration advantage
          To systematically evaluate the effects of bile acids on RM-1 cell viability, the concentration-gradient responses of CA, DCA, UDCA, and CDCA were analyzed using CCK-8 assays (Fig. 1A–D). The IC10, IC15, and IC20 concentrations were selected from SPSS-predicted inhibition ranges (IC10-IC25) to enable pharmacological comparisons under equivalent inhibition conditions while maintaining > 80% cell viability for physiologically relevant lipid metabolism studies. As shown in Fig. 1A-D, all bile acids exhibited clear concentration-dependent inhibitory effects, with CDCA demonstrating the strongest potency, as evidenced by its significantly lower IC10 concentration (0.05 µmol/L) compared to other compounds (P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Notably, statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed between high-concentration groups (IC20) and 0 µmol/L controls.

Quantification of Nile Red fluorescence intensity (n = 6). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001)

          To assess the combined effects of bile acids and linoleic acid (LA, 0.1 mmol/L), the ability of each bile acid to suppress LA-induced lipid accumulation at IC₁₀/IC₁₅/IC₂₀ concentrations was further assessed (Fig. 1E–K). Nile red staining revealed that CDCA and UDCA exhibited markedly stronger lipid-suppressive effects than CA and DCA. Strikingly, CDCA exhibited a 52-fold greater potency than UDCA, achieving comparable lipid suppression at a significantly lower IC₁₀ concentration (0.05 µmol/L vs. 2.6 µmol/L). Given its superior concentration-efficacy profile and robust lipid-modulatory capacity, CDCA was prioritized for subsequent mechanistic investigations.
        
        
          Multiple regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential, and androgen receptor (AR) expression in RM-1 cells
          As illustrated in Fig. 2, CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation induced by linoleic acid (LA, 0.1 mmol/L) in RM-1 cells (Figs. 2A–B). Quantitative analysis of Nile red fluorescence intensity revealed a marked reduction in lipid accumulation in the CDCA-treated group compared to the LA group. Magnified images further demonstrated that CDCA alleviated localized intracellular lipid droplet aggregation (Fig. 2C).

Nile Red staining of RM-1 cells co-treated with DHT and CDCA (IC10-IC20); M. Quantitative analysis of Nile Red fluorescence intensity (n = 6). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001)

          Given the close relationship between lipid synthesis and mitochondrial energy metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was assessed using JC-10 staining (Figs. 2D–E). LA stimulation significantly increased ΔΨm, indicated by enhanced red fluorescence and diminished green fluorescence, suggesting elevated energy metabolism. In contrast, CDCA treatment significantly reduced the elevated ΔΨm induced by LA, bringing it closer to baseline levels observed in untreated cells. Quantitative analysis of the JC-10 red-to-green fluorescence ratio confirmed that CDCA-treated cells exhibited significantly lower ΔΨm than LA-stimulated cells.
          Although CDCA simultaneously suppressed lipid accumulation and modulated ΔΨm, the causal relationship between these effects remains to be elucidated. LA-induced lipid synthesis may elevate energy demands, thereby augmenting ΔΨm. However, CDCA’s inhibitory effects extend beyond lipid synthesis suppression and may involve indirect mechanisms, such as modulating fatty acid metabolism or mitochondrial function, to influence ΔΨm. Thus, the interplay between reduced lipid synthesis and ΔΨm attenuation likely involves a complex regulatory network requiring further investigation.
          Furthermore, considering the close interplay between lipid metabolism and hormonal signaling in prostate cancer, AR overexpression in RM-1 cells was induced using DHT. After 48 h of DHT stimulation, both AR expression and lipid accumulation were significantly elevated (Figs. 2G–H). Additionally, CCK-8 proliferation assays demonstrated that DHT not only enhanced lipid accumulation but also increased cellular viability (Fig. 2F).
          Importantly, co-treatment with CDCA and DHT substantially reduced DHT-induced AR upregulation (Figs. 2I–K). These findings suggest that CDCA may regulate lipid synthesis and metabolism by modulating androgen signaling through AR suppression. This mechanistic insight underscores CDCA’s potential therapeutic value in lipid metabolism-related disorders, such as acne. Acne pathogenesis is closely linked to increased androgen levels and altered lipid metabolism. Elevated androgens, particularly DHT, stimulate sebaceous glands to produce excessive sebum, leading to clogged pores and promoting the growth of Cutibacterium acnes, a bacterium implicated in acne inflammation. Additionally, lipid metabolic dysfunction impairs the skin barrier and fosters an inflammatory environment conducive to acne development.
          Moreover, under 2-DHT treatment, lipid accumulation increased, while CDCA was able to suppress lipid accumulation concurrently with AR inhibition (Figs. 2L–M), further elucidating the positive correlation between AR and lipid metabolism.

          CDCA modulates lipid metabolism in RM-1 cells via regulation of fatty acid and energy metabolic pathways
          RNA sequencing analysis revealed that co-treatment with CDCA and LA significantly altered gene expression profiles in RM-1 cells (Fig. 3A). Compared to the LA-treated group, the CDCA + LA group exhibited 72 upregulated and 57 downregulated genes (Fig. 3C). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predominantly associated with lipid and fatty acid metabolism-related pathways (Fig. 3D). Notably, the enrichment of the fatty acid metabolism pathway underscores CDCA’s pivotal role in regulating fatty acid synthesis, degradation, and metabolic homeostasis. Additionally, the enrichment of TGF-β and FoxO signaling pathways suggests that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism through indirect mechanisms. The involvement of the GnRH signaling pathway further implies that CDCA could modulate fatty acid metabolism via endocrine regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, pathways related to energy metabolism, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, were enriched, suggesting a potential link between CDCA treatment and alterations in cellular energy homeostasis. Furthermore, the enrichment of pathways like amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism suggests potential interactions between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the regulation of fatty acids.

Statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA compared to the LA group. Significance indicators: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001

          Further KEGG enrichment analysis focused on lipid metabolism-related pathways (Fig. 3E). The results demonstrated significant enrichment in pathways including fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid degradation, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and bile acid biosynthesis. Energy metabolism-related pathways, such as the AMPK signaling pathway and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, were also closely associated with lipid metabolism. Sankey diagram analysis identified key genes involved in these differential pathways, including aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 family member (ALDH2), acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain (ACADVL), carbonyl reductase 4 (CBR4), hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 4 (HSD17B4), and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 2 (PCSK2) (Fig. 3F). Specifically, ACADVL and HSD17B4, involved in fatty acid metabolism and degradation pathways, suggest that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism by regulating the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. CBR4, associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, further emphasizes CDCA’s role in regulating fatty acid composition. Additionally, genes related to cholesterol metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis, such as ALDH2, indicate that CDCA may indirectly participate in the regulation of lipid homeostasis by affecting cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.
          Building upon RNA-Seq analyses and previous experimental findings, the regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid and fatty acid metabolism were further investigated. Key genes associated with lipid synthesis include SREBF1 and Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC), while genes pivotal in fatty acid metabolism encompass FASN and Fatty Acid Desaturases 1–3 (FADS1-3). The mRNA expression levels of these critical factors were assessed (Fig. 3G–L), and CDCA was found to significantly downregulate their expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis further confirmed the downregulation of lipid metabolism-related proteins, including FASN, SREBF1, and FADS2, upon CDCA treatment (Fig. 3M). Collectively, these findings suggest that CDCA modulates lipid metabolism by downregulating the expression of genes and proteins involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism, highlighting its potential application in regulating lipid metabolic processes.
        
      
      
        In vivo and in vitro validation of CDCA regulation on sebaceous gland lipid metabolism
        
          Regulation of sebaceous gland activity and lipid accumulation by CDCA in golden hamsters
          To elucidate the mechanisms underlying CDCA’s effects on lipid metabolism, this study utilized golden hamsters—an animal model characterized by a well-developed sebaceous gland system. Upon intradermal injection of CDCA into the sebaceous gland region, dermoscopic examination revealed a slight, non-significant reduction in the area of this region, accompanied by mild local inflammation and decreased melanin deposition (Fig. 4A). Oil Red O staining indicated that CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation in the sebaceous gland area, indicating its regulatory role in lipid metabolism (Fig. 4B–C). Further histological analysis through Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining showed no significant morphological changes in sebaceous gland tissue structure, suggesting that CDCA does not cause structural damage to the glands; however, a noticeable reduction in gland size was observed (Fig. 4D–E). Immunofluorescence staining revealed a significant decrease in Ki67 expression in peripheral sebaceous gland cells, indicating reduced cellular activity (Fig. 4G). Additionally, the expression levels of AR and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), both closely associated with lipid metabolism, were diminished following CDCA treatment. This finding aligns with observations in RM-1 cells, where CDCA not only regulates lipid metabolism but also affects AR expression. These results suggest that CDCA may modulate sebaceous

        In summary, the study demonstrates that CDCA regulates sebaceous gland homeostasis by reducing lipid accumulation and cellular activity, potentially through the modulation of AR and PPAR-γ. Importantly, this effect occurs without disrupting the overall glandular structure, providing a theoretical basis for the application of CDCA in treating sebaceous gland-related disorders.
        
          Regulation of fatty acid composition and lipid accumulation by CDCA in primary sebaceous gland cells
          Building upon previous in vivo findings demonstrating that CDCA inhibits lipid accumulation and AR expression in the sebaceous glands of golden hamsters, its effects on sebaceous gland cells were further investigated using a primary sebaceous gland cell model.
          Lipidomic analysis (Fig. 5A) revealed that CDCA treatment significantly altered the fatty acid composition in primary sebaceous gland cells, including increased levels of various unsaturated fatty acids (such as linoleic acid and arachidonic acid) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, while decreasing certain saturated fatty acids (like palmitic acid). These changes suggest that CDCA optimizes the fatty acid profile by enhancing anti-inflammatory fatty acids (e.g., linoleic acid, which promotes skin barrier repair) and reducing pro-inflammatory saturated fatty acids.

Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA versus control group: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001

          Further Deep DIA proteomic analysis (Fig. 5B) unveiled the regulatory mechanisms of CDCA. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that CDCA modulates pathways related to fatty acid metabolism and degradation, including β-oxidation and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, CDCA significantly impacts mitochondrial function-related pathways (such as ATP synthesis and mitochondrial metabolism), implying its influence on lipid metabolism through mitochondrial energy regulation.
          A CCK-8 assay identified a non-toxic concentration of CDCA for primary sebaceous gland cells (25 µmol/L) (Fig. 5C). Nile Red staining (Fig. 5E and G) further confirmed that CDCA inhibits lipid accumulation in primary sebaceous gland cells. Under linoleic acid (0.0125 mmol/L) stimulation, CDCA significantly suppressed lipid accumulation, demonstrating its direct regulatory effect on sebocyte lipid metabolism.
          CDCA reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in primary sebaceous gland cells, mirroring the effects observed in RM-1 cells. Moreover, considering the association between lipid accumulation and androgens, CDCA decreased AR expression and lipid accumulation induced by 2-DHT (Fig. 5H–K), aligning with effects observed in RM-1 cells.
          In summary, CDCA regulates sebaceous lipid metabolism through multiple mechanisms, including altering fatty acid composition, modulating metabolic pathways, affecting mitochondrial function, and concurrently regulating AR expression. These findings underscore CDCA’s pivotal role in lipid metabolism regulation and its potential therapeutic value in treating lipid metabolism-related disorders.
        
      
    
    
      Discussion
      Lipid metabolism plays a central role in maintaining essential physiological processes such as cellular function, energy balance, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism not only affects normal physiological functions but is also closely associated with the onset and progression of various diseases [11, 21, 22]. Recent studies have demonstrated that CDCA, a primary active component of bear bile, exhibits significant potential in regulating lipid metabolic disorders [20]. This study further investigated the role of CDCA in lipid metabolism regulation. The effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism were systematically examined using various cell models, including RM-1 cells, primary sebaceous gland cells, and in vivo experiments targeting the sebaceous gland area of golden hamsters. The results indicated that CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation across these different cell and animal models, primarily by modulating fatty acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
      Initially, CDCA’s regulatory effects on lipids were validated using two cell lines. In RM-1 cells, CDCA significantly inhibited LA-induced lipid accumulation, exhibiting noticeable effects even at lower concentrations (IC10, 0.05 µmol/L), outperforming other bile acids such as UDCA. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that CDCA’s impact on RM-1 lipid metabolism was primarily focused on the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and energy metabolism. PCR and Western blot results indicate that CDCA significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of key genes such as SREBF1, ACC, FASN, FADS1-3, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). Inhibition of ACC and FASN directly affected de novo fatty acid synthesis, while downregulation of FADS and SCD1 might have reduced the production of unsaturated fatty acids, thereby influencing the composition of intracellular fatty acids. In primary sebaceous gland cells, lipidomics analysis further confirmed CDCA’s regulatory effects on fatty acid composition [23–25]. CDCA treatment significantly upregulated the content of various unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., LA, arachidonic acid) while inhibiting the expression of certain saturated fatty acids (e.g., palmitic acid). This regulation not only optimizes fatty acid composition but may also improve skin condition by increasing the proportion of anti-inflammatory fatty acids (e.g., LA).
      This study revealed the regulatory effects of CDCA on fatty acid metabolism and, for the first time, systematically explored its impact on energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. In RM-1 cells, a significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was observed following CDCA treatment, suggesting that CDCA might have influenced the cellular energy metabolic state by regulating mitochondrial function. RNA-Seq analysis further supported this view, showing significant changes in energy metabolism-related pathways such as ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling after CDCA treatment. This aligns with recent research published in Nano Letters, which demonstrated that CDCA-loaded nanoparticles can reduce adipocyte size by inducing mitochondrial functions, including promoting β-oxidation [26]. Proteomic results from primary sebaceous gland cells also confirmed this conclusion, indicating that CDCA not only affects fatty acid metabolism but also significantly regulates processes related to mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation. This consistent effect across different cell types suggests that CDCA may influence energy metabolism and mitochondrial function through a universal mechanism, thereby regulating fatty acid metabolism and balance. Additionally, studies by Liu J et al. have shown that CDCA may promote lipid peroxidation by activating the ROS/p38 MAPK/DGAT1 axis and can directly bind to mitochondria, inducing mitochondrial changes in AML cells, including swelling and cristae reduction [27]. These findings complement previous discoveries and collectively reveal the multifaceted role of CDCA in regulating energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.
      Through RNA-Seq and proteomic analyses, several signaling pathways potentially involved in CDCA’s mechanism of action were identified. The AMPK signaling pathway was likely a key mechanism by which CDCA regulates lipid metabolism. Additionally, changes in TGF-β and FoxO signaling pathways suggested that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism by regulating cell differentiation and metabolism. Notably, CDCA’s impact on the GnRH signaling pathway was also observed, which may explain its regulatory effects on hormone-related lipid metabolism. In the experimental validation section, RM-1 cells were stimulated with DHT to induce AR overexpression, and CDCA was found to reduce AR expression as well. This indicates that CDCA can regulate hormone expression while modulating lipids, further confirming the close relationship between abnormal lipid accumulation and hormone levels.
      Comprehensive results indicated that CDCA exhibited bidirectional regulation of fatty acid metabolism. On one hand, it inhibits fatty acid synthesis by downregulating genes such as SREBF1 and ACC. On the other hand, Deep DIA analysis suggests that CDCA might promote fatty acid degradation by activating β-oxidation phosphorylation-related pathways. This bidirectional regulatory mechanism enabled CDCA to more precisely balance intracellular fatty acid levels; moreover, it can optimize fatty acid composition, providing a theoretical basis for its potential application in diseases related to lipid metabolic disorders.
      Based on the research findings and existing literature, CDCA emerged as a versatile regulator of lipid metabolism with promising therapeutic applications. In skin-related lipid metabolism disorders, CDCA may hold potential value in the treatment of acne and seborrheic alopecia. Observations in primary sebaceous gland cells indicate that CDCA suppresses lipid accumulation and optimizes fatty acid composition, providing direct evidence for its potential application in these conditions. By reducing sebum accumulation and increasing the proportion of anti-inflammatory fatty acids, CDCA may help alleviate acne symptoms [7, 28]. In the context of seborrheic alopecia, CDCA’s regulation of sebaceous gland activity could assist in controlling excessive oil accumulation. In diseases associated with lipid metabolism abnormalities, such as prostate cancer, CDCA’s potential role warrants attention. CDCA exhibited inhibitory effects on lipid metabolism and modulated AR expression in RM-1 prostate cancer cells, providing novel insights into its therapeutic potential for prostate cancer. CDCA may inhibit tumor cell growth and metastasis by modulating lipid metabolism and hormone signaling pathways [29–31].
      In summary, CDCA’s consistent effects across various cell models, its comprehensive regulation of lipid metabolism, and its impact on energy metabolism and mitochondrial function laid the foundation for its potential application in the treatment of multiple diseases. Future research should further explore CDCA’s mechanisms of action, optimize administration methods, and conduct preclinical and clinical studies to fully harness its potential in treating lipid metabolism-related diseases.
      
        Study strengths and limitations
        This study offers several important strengths. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics, a comprehensive and multi-layered understanding of how CDCA regulates lipid metabolism was established. This integrative approach was applied across RM-1 prostate cancer cells, primary sebaceous gland cells, and in vivo golden hamster models, ensuring both mechanistic depth and translational relevance. Notably, CDCA exhibited a bidirectional regulatory pattern—suppressing de novo fatty acid synthesis through SREBF1, ACC, and FASN, while simultaneously promoting fatty acid degradation pathways such as β-oxidation. The study also uncovered a previously underappreciated role of CDCA in mitochondrial regulation and energy metabolism, supported by consistent findings across multiple datasets and functional assays. Furthermore, the dual applicability of CDCA in both dermatological (acne and seborrheic disorders) and oncological (prostate cancer) settings broadens its therapeutic significance and opens up possibilities for cross-disciplinary interventions.
        Despite these contributions, several limitations should be acknowledged. The study did not clarify whether CDCA’s effects are mediated through canonical bile acid receptors such as FXR or TGR5, which could provide more targeted mechanistic insight. Although key signaling pathways like AMPK and MAPK were highlighted in the omics data, their involvement was not directly confirmed using pharmacological or genetic methods. Additionally, the in vivo validation was limited to the sebaceous gland model, while findings related to prostate cancer were based solely on in vitro assays, thus limiting their immediate clinical translation. Lastly, although CDCA is already used clinically, its long-term safety and toxicity profile, particularly in the context of topical or dermatological applications, remained to be evaluated. Future studies focusing on receptor mechanisms, pathway validation, and formulation safety will be essential to fully translate CDCA into therapeutic use.
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      CDCA demonstrates potential in modulating lipid metabolism by reducing lipid accumulation and reshaping fatty acid composition in RM-1 prostate cancer cells and sebaceous gland cells. It also influences mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, with in vivo validation confirming its regulatory effect on sebaceous gland homeostasis. These findings provide a foundation for developing novel, mechanism-based interventions to address sebaceous and metabolic disorders in a more targeted and sustainable manner. Further studies are warranted to optimize delivery strategies and comprehensively assess the safety and translational potential of CDCA for long-term therapeutic use.

Title: Changes in the Skin Microbiome of a Patient with Head and Neck Cancer with Severe Radiodermatitis: A Case Report

Abstract: AbstractIntroductionIdentifying the skin microbiome associated with severe radiodermatitis could lead to the development of preventive care strategies and early healing interventions, which are currently lacking. In this study, we investigated changes in the skin microbiome of a patient with head and neck cancer who developed severe radiodermatitis from the initiation of radiation therapy to the resolution of dermatitis.Case PresentationAn 82-year-old male underwent chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (69.96 Gy/33 fractions) for recurrent laryngeal cancer after a total laryngectomy. At baseline, Cutibacterium accounted for 64.3% of the skin microbiome and Staphylococcus for 23.2%. During the occurrence of moist desquamation associated with severe radiodermatitis, Cutibacterium decreased sharply to 0.2%, whereas Staphylococcus increased to 91.0%. Species-level analysis revealed that Staphylococcus aureus was dominant at 50.6%, whereas Staphylococcus hominis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were identified at 0.4% and 1.7%, respectively.ConclusionThese findings demonstrated that changes in the skin microbiome occur during the progression of severe radiodermatitis. The reduction in Cutibacterium and overgrowth of Staphylococcus, particularly Staphylococcus aureus, suggest their involvement in the development of severe radiodermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer.

Body: Introduction
      In addition to surgery, definitive radiotherapy is an essential treatment option for head and neck cancer that is administered to many patients. Radiation induces DNA damage in basal epidermal and hair follicle stem cells, triggering inflammatory responses. Consequently, most patients with head and neck cancers develop radiodermatitis that manifests as dry skin and erythema, and approximately 25% experience severe radiodermatitis with moist desquamation [1]. Severe radiodermatitis significantly reduces patients’ quality of life as it causes intense pain, making its prevention a critical aspect of care. Numerous studies on its prevention using recommended cleansing and moisturizing agents have been conducted; however, effective preventive care strategies remain unclear.
      Recent studies have revealed an association between inflammatory skin diseases and the skin microbiome, leading to the development of new treatment approaches targeting Staphylococcus aureus in atopic dermatitis [2]. As radiodermatitis is also caused by radiation-induced inflammation, it is plausible that the skin microbiome is involved. Previous studies have demonstrated an increase in S. aureus on skin affected by severe radiodermatitis [3], and a lower relative abundance of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis, and Cutibacterium acnes is associated with the development of severe radiodermatitis in patients with breast cancer [4]. However, no studies have investigated the longitudinal changes in the skin microbiome throughout the course of severe radiodermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer, making it unclear which bacterial species could serve as potential targets for preventive interventions.
      In this study, we examined the longitudinal changes in the skin microbiome at the irradiated site in a patient with head and neck cancer who developed radiodermatitis with moist desquamation from before the initiation of radiotherapy until radiodermatitis resolved.
    
    
      Case Presentation
      The patient was an 82-year-old male who underwent chemoradiotherapy (cisplatin combined with 69.96 in Gy/33 fractions using volumetric modulated arc therapy with 6 MV X-ray) for recurrent stage IV laryngeal cancer in January 2023. Radiotherapy was administered once daily in five fractions per week without discontinuation. The prescribed dose of radiotherapy was 70 Gy for gross tumor volume, 59.4 Gy for high-risk clinical target volume, and 54 Gy for low-risk clinical target volume in 33 fractions. The patient underwent a total laryngectomy, resulting in a tracheostoma. Before radiotherapy (baseline), skin barrier function assessment indicated corneometer hydration at 56.0, transepidermal water loss at 13.57 g/h/m2, skin pH at 4.90, and sebum secretion at 6 µg.
      Faint erythema appeared during the first week of treatment (10.6 Gy) and intensified to moderate erythema by the 6th week (63.3 Gy). By the 7th week (1 day after completion of radiotherapy), extensive moist desquamation was observed. However, dermatitis healed with scab formation by the 10th week (22 days after radiotherapy completion) (Fig. 1). Starting from the 5th week, the patient was administered heparin lotion and azulene ointment on the irradiated area. From the 7th week, when moist desquamation occurred, corticosteroids and nonadherent gauze were applied until healing was achieved. Due to the presence of a tracheostoma, the patient had difficulty performing self-care, so nurses performed skin cleansing and treatment.

Radiodermatitis progressed from faint erythema during the first week/10.6 Gy (a) to moderate erythema at 6 weeks/63.30 Gy (b), extensive moist desquamation at 7 weeks/1st day post-radiotherapy (c), and dermatitis healed with scab formation by the 10th week (22 days after radiotherapy completion) (d).
        
        
      
      Skin samples were collected weekly from baseline until the resolution of radiodermatitis from the side of the neck (within the irradiated field) using swabs. The skin microbiome composition was analyzed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing using a next-generation sequencer based on the relative abundance of bacterial species. At baseline, the microbiome consisted of Cutibacterium (64.3%) and Staphylococcus (23.2%). During radiotherapy, Cutibacterium remained predominant; however, by the 7th week (1 day after radiotherapy completion), Staphylococcus accounted for 91.0%, whereas Cutibacterium dropped to 0.2% and did not recover even after radiodermatitis healed (Fig. 2). At the species level (Fig. 3), S. aureus accounted for 50.6%, S. hominis for 0.4%, and S. epidermidis for 1.7% during the 7th week when Staphylococcus had increased. DNA amplification failed in skin microbiome samples from the 3rd, 6th, and 8th weeks, making analysis impossible.

      Discussion
      In a patient with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy, the onset of severe radiodermatitis coincided with changes in skin microbiome composition: a marked decrease in Cutibacterium and an increase in Staphylococcus. These findings suggest a possible association between skin microbiome dysbiosis and severe radiodermatitis. The skin microbiome is predominantly composed of Cutibacterium, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium, the relative abundances of which are influenced by physical, chemical, and biological factors, including skin moisture [5]. During head and neck radiotherapy, high doses (approximately 70 Gy) are delivered, exacerbating skin inflammation and dryness when radiodermatitis becomes severe. The baseline skin barrier function of the patient was intact; however, changes in the skin condition due to radiodermatitis appear to have led to alterations in the composition of the skin microbiome, characterized by a decrease in Cutibacterium and an increase in Staphylococcus.
      Moist desquamation leads to exudate production and alters skin pH owing to the application of ointments, which may also promote changes in the composition of the skin microbiome. As Staphylococcus thrives in moist environments, such as the axillae [5], the moist conditions caused by exudate and ointment application during severe radiodermatitis likely facilitated its proliferation. Conversely, Cutibacterium was predominant in sebum-rich areas. Radiation-induced impairment of sebaceous gland function and a subsequent decrease in sebum levels likely contributed to the reduction in Cutibacterium. Similar trends have been reported in patients with atopic dermatitis, where reduced Cutibacterium and increased Staphylococcus counts were associated with impaired skin barrier function, elevated skin pH, and decreased sebum levels [6]. In the present case, even after radiodermatitis healed, the skin microbiome did not return to its baseline composition. This may be due to persistent skin barrier dysfunction, as skin temperature elevation [7] and increased transepidermal water loss levels [8] reportedly persist even after the resolution of radiodermatitis.
      The skin microbiome plays a vital role in maintaining skin health owing to its diversity and balance. A previous study has reported a significant reduction in skin microbiome diversity in areas affected by radiodermatitis [9]. At the microbial species level, an increased S. aureus density promotes inflammation [5]. S. aureus colonization is common in severe atopic dermatitis, in which skin barrier dysfunction allows it to penetrate the dermis and trigger inflammatory cytokines [10]. In contrast, S. hominis and S. epidermidis inhibit S. aureus colonization [11]. The low abundances of S. hominis and S. epidermidis in this case may have contributed to the proliferation of S. aureus. Previous studies have reported an association between reduced S. hominis and S. epidermidis levels and the onset of radiodermatitis [4], as well as increased S. aureus levels in radiation-damaged skin [3]. Additionally, because the stratum corneum becomes thinner during radiodermatitis and the skin barrier is compromised, increased inflammation caused by S. aureus proliferation may exacerbate the severity of radiodermatitis. S. hominis, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus may serve as key bacterial targets for preventing severe radiodermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer.
      The findings of this study suggest that dysbiosis of the skin microbiome may contribute to the development of severe radiodermatitis, with particular involvement of Cutibacterium and Staphylococcus, especially S. aureus. Recent work has demonstrated a gut-skin microbial axis, suggesting that interventions to maintain gut microbial balance could help prevent skin-microbiome dysbiosis [12]. Additionally, a report shows topical prebiotics can restore skin microbial diversity and reduce S. aureus abundance [13]. However, further case reports and studies are needed to develop preventive care strategies based on microbiome alterations. Study limitations include the inability to analyze certain samples due to radiation-induced DNA degradation and the challenge of collecting microbiome samples from fragile, radiation-damaged skin. To overcome these limitations, future studies should explore alternative skin microbiome sampling methods and incorporate additional biomarkers, such as skin blotting, a technique that collects molecules non-invasively.
    
    
      Conclusions
      This case reveals that changes in the skin microbiome occur during the progression of severe radiodermatitis, suggesting that Cutibacterium and Staphylococcus, particularly S. aureus, are involved in the development of severe radiodermatitis in patients with head and neck cancer.

Title: Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Association with Ulcerative Proctitis: Surgical Management in a Refractory Case to Topical and Systemic Treatment

Abstract: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a challenging dermatological condition, can be described as a chronic, painful, follicular, occlusive disease that is characterized by painful nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts generally located in the intertriginous skin areas. This disorder places a considerable burden on affected individuals and often leads to significant impairment in quality of life for those grappling with its persistent and recurrent nature. We present the case of a 20-year-old male patient known to have ulcerative proctitis and diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2020, for which he underwent various topical and systemic treatments, with periods of remission and recurrent flares without managing to obtain complete remission of HS. In our dermatology service, the patient underwent two surgical unroofing procedures combined with punch debridement, with the wounds being allowed to heal by secondary intention. This choice of treatment delivered great results with favorable outcomes, without recurrence of the lesions, proving to be an effective method for managing HS. By presenting this case, we underline the role of surgical procedures in managing HS, and our desire is to emphasize the importance of comprehensive understanding of this enigmatic and complex condition for more effective management strategies in patients with refractory disease.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Hidradenitis suppurativa, also known as acne inversa [1], stands as a dermatological enigma characterized by the chronic and debilitating nature of its inflammatory skin lesions. HS is a chronic follicular occlusive disease affecting the follicular portion of the folliculopilosebaceous units (FPSUs), characterized by the development of painful nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts, that places a considerable burden on affected individuals [2]. This disorder primarily affects the intertriginous areas, such as the axillae, groin, and buttocks, and often leads to significant impairment in quality of life for those grappling with its persistent and recurrent nature [3].
      The epidemiology of HS is a dynamic landscape, with estimates suggesting a prevalence of approximately 1% in the general population [4]. However, this prevalence might be underestimated due to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis, underscoring the need for heightened clinical awareness. HS typically emerges in early adulthood, presenting a peak onset in the second and third decades of life. The gender predilection is notable, with a higher prevalence in females, although the disease’s severity may be more pronounced in males [5].
      The pathogenesis of HS involves a multifaceted interplay of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. Current evidence suggests a polygenic inheritance, with mutations in genes associated with inflammation, innate immunity, and the follicular epithelium contributing to disease susceptibility. Dysregulation of the immune response, particularly involving the interleukin pathway, plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory cascades observed in HS [6].
      The probable instigating factor for the initial formation of HS lesions is follicular occlusion, which stems from the proliferation of ductal keratinocytes, resulting in follicular hyperkeratosis and blockage. It is suggested that associated factors within this process are the hormones and nicotine, which have a negative impact on the follicular epithelium. The resulting anoxia within the follicular duct, induced by follicular epithelial hyperplasia, contributes to the disturbance of the usual terminal differentiation of follicular keratinocytes, obstructing the follicular passage and subsequent follicular rupture [7]. 
      The occlusion of hair follicles, subsequent inflammation, and bacterial colonization contribute to the formation of abscesses and sinus tracts characteristic of HS lesions. Skin tunnels that have been firmly established ultimately emerge onto the surface of the skin, undergoing persistent inflammation. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, and poor diet further exacerbate the disease, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the disease’s pathophysiology [8]. Furthermore, several studies indicate a correlation between HS and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [9], both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) [10], as they exhibit some similarities to HS regarding clinical manifestations, genetic predisposition, and immunological characteristics.
      Regarding its clinical manifestation, hidradenitis suppurativa unfolds with painful, inflamed nodules that may progress to abscesses and sinus tracts. These lesions predominantly manifest in intertriginous areas, including the axillae (most common site), inguinal area, inframammary, and perianal regions. The formation of skin tunnels, clusters of exposed comedones (referred to as tombstone comedones), and scarring are outcomes observed in cases of recurring or persistent disease. The disease course is generally marked by recurrent flares and remission periods, which contribute to its chronic nature [11]. 
      Disease onset typically occurs post-puberty, often in the second and third decades of life, and there is a correlation between the earlier onset of HS and a more extensive and widespread disease [12]. Furthermore, diagnosis of the condition is often delayed, especially in cases categorized as ‘mild’ and intermittent, the primary inflammatory nodules being commonly misdiagnosed as furuncles [13]. On top of that, the lack of a specific diagnostic test demands a meticulous clinical assessment for the diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa. The diagnosis relies on the presence of typical lesions, typical topography, and chronicity and recurrences [2]. Diagnostic criteria, including the Hurley staging system and the International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4), aid in categorizing disease severity and guiding treatment decisions. 
      The Hurley clinical staging system is commonly employed to categorize patients with HS into three levels of disease severity: Stage I: formation of abscesses (single or multiple) without skin tunnels or cicatrization/scarring; Stage II: recurrent abscesses accompanied by skin tunnels and scarring, with single or multiple lesions widely separated; and Stage III: widespread or nearly widespread involvement, or the presence of multiple interconnected skin tunnels and abscesses across the entire affected area [14]. The majority of HS patients typically fall under stage I disease [15].
      IHS4 represents a validated instrument for dynamically evaluating the severity of hidradenitis suppurativa. IHS4 is determined by tallying the number of nodules (multiplied by 1), abscesses (multiplied by 2), and draining tunnels (multiplied by 4). A cumulative score of 3 or below indicates mild disease, 4–10 denotes moderate severity, and 11 or higher indicates severe HS [16]. By incorporating these criteria, IHS4 offers clinicians a standardized framework for assessing and monitoring HS severity, facilitating improved treatment decisions and patient management strategies.
      Managing hidradenitis suppurativa necessitates a nuanced, multimodal approach, reflecting the chronic and relapsing nature of the disease. Lifestyle modifications, encompassing weight loss and smoking cessation, emerge as foundational pillars of disease management [17]. The severity of the disease has a significant impact on the approach to treatment. 
      In milder cases (Hurley stage I), therapy aims to reduce the burden of the disease (i.e., to limit the development of lesions and inhibit the progression of the disease) and to improve acute, symptomatic lesions. The treatment consists of topical and systemic antibiotics that target bacterial colonization, mitigating inflammation [18]. Although the initial therapy in these cases consists generally of oral tetracyclines, topical clindamycin is occasionally considered and might serve as a viable initial approach for individuals with mild disease. Oral antiandrogenic medications and metformin represent supplementary treatment choices that can be employed independently or in combination with antibiotics. Further measures for managing symptomatic inflamed nodules encompass intralesional corticosteroid injections, punch debridement (partial unroofing), and the application of topical resorcinol [19].
      A spectrum of interventions comes into play for moderate to severe disease (Hurley stage II or III). Oral antibiotic therapy, intralesional corticosteroid injections, systemic immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies—the latter targeting specific inflammatory pathways—showcase efficacy in controlling disease progression. Furthermore, surgical options, including drainage of abscesses, surgical unroofing, and excision of involved tissue, prove beneficial in refractory cases, although necessitating carefully weighing risks and benefits [20].
      In this case report we present the case of a 20-year-old male known to have ulcerative proctitis and diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2020, for which he underwent two surgical interventions of incision and drainage in another service, various topical treatments (clindamycin 1% solution, resorcinol 15% cream and topical antiseptic washes), and systemic treatments (oral doxycycline), with periods of remission, recurrent flares and persistent worsening of symptoms in recent months. This case report will outline the surgical treatment options chosen, the decisions made, and the subsequent outcome for our patient. By presenting this case, our intention is to underscore the significance of possessing a thorough understanding of this intricate condition. Such understanding is pivotal in devising more effective management strategies, especially for patients grappling with refractory disease.
    
    
      2. Detailed Case Description
      We present a case involving a 20-year-old male, a non-smoker with a normal BMI known with ulcerative proctitis and diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2020, who sought clinical evaluation and specialized treatment in our clinic. 
      In 2015, the patient received a diagnosis of mild ulcerative proctitis and underwent a four-week treatment regimen of topical mesalamine at a daily dose of 1 g, leading to subsequent remission of the disease. Since then, there has been a single episode of disease relapse, effectively managed with topical mesalamine without the necessity for ongoing maintenance therapy.
      The onset of HS symptoms occurred three years before. Since then, the patient has undergone a range of treatments: two surgical interventions of incision and drainage in another service, various topical treatments (clindamycin 1% solution, one application per day, resorcinol 15% cream, one application per day, and topical antiseptic washes) and systemic treatments (oral doxycycline 50 mg once daily for three months), with periods of remission and recurrent flares, without managing to obtain the complete remission of the disease.
      At the current presentation, the dermatological clinical exam reveals typical lesions of HS located in both of the patient’s axillae. In the left axilla, we observed two skin tunnels, one inflammatory nodule, and a thick, linear, rope-like band of scarring (Figure 1a). On the other hand, in the right axilla, we described one solitary skin tunnel and two deep-seated inflamed nodules with minimal scarring (Figure 1b). Following the extent and severity of lesions, the patient was classified as having Hurley stage II disease and an IHS4 score of 15. 
      In instances where the prevention of new lesions proves unsuccessful and medical therapy for established and growing lesions is ineffective, surgery becomes the acknowledged approach for managing hidradenitis suppurativa. Considering this, in the current context of our patient’s presentation, we opted for the surgical management of the axillary lesions.
      Initially, we conducted the surgical treatment of lesions localized in the left axilla under localized anesthesia using lidocaine 1% (Figure 2a). We performed the surgical unroofing of two skin tunnels (Figure 2b) and the punch debridement of one inflammatory nodule (Figure 2c). The punch debridement procedure utilized a 5 mm circular punch instrument to excise the isolated inflammatory nodule, along with a minimal amount of surrounding tissue. 
      In the context of the surgical unroofing technique, the procedure commenced with the delineation of the affected area followed by local anesthesia administration (adrenaline was utilized to prolong the duration of action). Due to the absence of a discernible sinus tract opening, a surgical entry point was established through the overlying skin. A guiding probe was introduced through the surgical entry point and meticulously navigated along the entire length of the sinus tract. Subsequently, an incision was made along the probe’s trajectory, resulting in the detachment of the upper portion of the sinus tract. The entire roof of each tract was meticulously excised, and both the base and margins were explored for concealed entrances to other tunnels. Cellular debris at the base of the tract was debrided, along with any superficial scar tissue and granulation tissue, thereby aiding in the elimination of the biofilm lining the tunnel. Superficial curettage resulted in a uniform, bleeding lesion bed at the subcutaneous level.
      After the procedures, the wounds were allowed to heal by secondary intention (Figure 2d), using just some dressing pads with a silicone wound contact layer. Following the intervention, the patient was prescribed a course of antibiotic therapy consisting of Cefuroxime 500 mg, taken twice daily for a duration of 5 days. The patient was given detailed instructions regarding the wound care regimen to be followed at home, which involved gently cleansing the area with an antiseptic solution, followed by the application of a moist dressing containing a neutral ointment, and sealing with a superabsorbent silicon-lined dressing. The patient diligently followed this home care protocol for 2 weeks. After the follow-up assessment, we advised the patient to apply another ointment with antibacterial and scar-reducing properties, containing silver sulfadiazine. 
      The patient attended follow-up appointments at two weeks (Figure 3a) and four weeks (Figure 3b) post operation, demonstrating a favorable progression of the lesions with no indication of inflammation or infection.
      Subsequently, we performed the surgical management of the lesions localized in the right axilla, performing the surgical unroofing of one skin tunnel and the punch debridement of two inflammatory nodules (Figure 4a), leaving the wounds to heal by secondary intention (Figure 4b). The patient attended follow-up appointments at two weeks (Figure 4c) and four weeks (Figure 4d) post-operation, also showing a favorable evolution. Six months post intervention, the patient is in total remission without any new HS lesions in the axillary region or any other areas. 
    
    
      3. Discussion
      Several risk factors have been statistically established as contributing to the development of hidradenitis suppurativa. Factors such as genetic susceptibility, mechanical stresses on the skin, obesity, smoking, dietary habits, and hormonal influences are frequently mentioned as potential contributors linked to the onset or worsening of HS. Our case diverges, as the patient lacked any of these factors mentioned. He was a non-smoker with a normal BMI, maintained a healthy dietary habit, and had no familial history of genetic susceptibility to the condition.
      Most notably, our patient was known to have mild ulcerative proctitis, diagnosed in 2015 and, at presentation, in clinical remission after the treatment with topical mesalamine. Several studies indicate a correlation between hidradenitis suppurativa and inflammatory bowel disease [9]. Earlier research suggested that the association between HS and IBD was present only in Crohn’s disease [21], with no apparent link to hidradenitis suppurativa in ulcerative colitis [22]. However, this notion has since been disproved, as subsequent studies are increasingly revealing a correlation between HS and ulcerative colitis as well. The most recent study is that of Bingzhou Bao et al., in 2023; theirs was a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study proving a robust causal relationship between IBD of both subtypes (CD and UC) and HS [23]. Concerning the pathophysiological aspect, there is some evidence indicating that IBD and HS share common clinical manifestations [24], genetic predisposition, and immunological profiles [22]; however, further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of the causal connection between IBD and HS.
      As far as treatment is concerned, our patient underwent a variety of interventions to manage the disease. He reported having undergone two surgical procedures involving incision and drainage in another service but experienced a swift recurrence of the lesions. Currently, it has been demonstrated that the customary practice of incision and drainage (I&D) for individual nodules is deemed ineffective and unsuitable for managing hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) [25]. I&D offers only temporary relief, and as it fails to address the actively growing tissue, lesions treated in this manner often experience recurrence [26].
      Our patient was classified as having Hurley stage II disease. In this stage of HS, the primary therapeutic strategy to reduce the disease burden involves using oral antibiotics, typically oral tetracyclines or a combination of oral clindamycin and rifampin [27]. Our patient had previously undergone a three-month course of oral doxycycline at a daily dosage of 50 mg, yielding no substantial improvement in the lesions. Typically, doxycycline is prescribed at a recommended dosage of 100 mg, administered once to twice daily [28]. The suboptimal response to the treatment observed in our patient could be attributed to the lower dosage employed during the course. 
      On the other hand, for the treatment of acute, symptomatic lesions, additional interventions are necessary that may consist of intralesional corticosteroid injections [29], punch debridement, unroofing [30], and topical resorcinol [31]. For our patient, intermittent use of topical resorcinol 15% cream was employed to address newly inflamed nodules, resulting in temporary alleviation of pain; however, unfortunately, upon discontinuation of the medication there was a rapid recurrence of symptoms. In our case, the various topical and systemic treatments resulted in periods of remission and recurrent flares without obtaining a complete remission of the disease. In this instance, there are alternative medical treatment options to consider, including biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors like adalimumab [32] and infliximab [33], the interleukin (IL) 17A inhibitor secukinumab [34], and oral acitretin (for patients not of childbearing potential) [27]. However, these treatments were not deemed necessary in our case as the lesions were localized, and the patient was considered suitable for surgical management of the disease.
      A diverse array of surgical techniques are employed in the treatment of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. These methods can be customized based on factors such as disease stage, defect size, bacterial contamination level, anatomical location, and the consideration of scar placement and potential for revision. The most-used surgical techniques are punch debridement with a 5 to 7 mm punch biopsy instrument and surgical unroofing, which involves removal of the superficial portion of the lesion [35] followed by closure by secondary intention [36]; these techniques were also used in our case. For more severe cases, extensive excision may be necessary to address a region affected by chronic or widespread hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage III) when conservative medical and surgical interventions prove ineffective [37]. 
      In our case, the surgical intervention yielded outstanding results. At the moment, more than six months post surgical treatment, the patient remains free of any recurrence of lesions. This affirms the effectiveness of surgical methods as an impactful approach for managing moderate-stage hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage II). This strategy proves particularly advantageous for patients with inflammatory nodules and skin tunnels that do not respond to traditional topical or systemic therapies.
    
    
      4. Conclusions
      Based on a thorough case analysis, the patient under consideration exhibited no apparent common risk factors for developing HS, with the only noteworthy association being the diagnosis of ulcerative proctitis. This correlation underscores the complexity of the disease and highlights the interplay of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors in the development of this disorder. Despite being unresponsive to initial topical and systemic therapy, the patient responded remarkably well to the surgical management of the disease. The present case underlines the importance of surgical procedures in managing moderate-stage hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage II). This comprehensive exploration, spanning the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, staging, diagnosis, and most of all the surgical treatment of HS, underscores the importance of thoroughly understanding this complex condition for a more effective management strategy, especially in patients with refractory disease. As we navigate the intricacies of HS, a better patient-centered approach emerges, promising improved outcomes and enhanced quality of life for those grappling with this enigmatic condition.

Title: A Recalcitrant Case of Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Successful Combination of Biologic, Antibiotic, and Surgical Therapy

Abstract: AbstractIntroductionHidradenitis suppurativa (HS), or acne inversa, is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that leads to painful nodules, abscesses, and fistulas.Case PresentationThis case describes the treatment of a 49-year-old male patient with progressive and massively inflamed HS for 20 years who also suffered from heart failure (NYHA II–III, EF 35–40%) and hypochromic microcytic anaemia (Hb 7.8 g/dL). Upon presentation, he was suffering from fatigue and severe pain (8–9/10, NRS). Due to prolonged immobility, knee and hip joint contractures with extension deficits were present. At the initial presentation, communicating, and purulent sinus tracts were observed bilaterally from the gluteal to femoral region and perianal area. Hurley score III, HS-PGA score: very severe, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score: 19, ISH4 score: severe (16). Under adalimumab s.c. 40 mg/week combined with clindamycin (300 mg bd), the condition had worsened. The patient was admitted to the hospital for i.v. administration of ertapenem 1 g/day for 14 days in preparation for sinus tract resection. With an Hb level of 7.8 g/dL, the patient received iron carboxymaltose and erythropoietin. After a significant reduction in inflammatory markers (leukocytes 17.11/nL to 7.42/nL), a large excision of the sinus tracts was performed bilaterally in the gluteal region and left femoral area. Following 4 weeks of wound granulation, split-thickness skin grafting was performed. The knee and hip joint contractures improved with intensive physiotherapy. After surgery, the patient received antibiotic therapy with clindamycin, rifampicin, and metronidazole (clindamycin 600 mg, rifampicin 300 mg, metronidazole 500 mg, each p.o. 2×/day). In parallel, anti-inflammatory therapy with secukinumab 300 mg s.c. twice a month was initiated. Over the following 3 months, no progression or recurrence occurred. Quality of life and pain levels improved significantly under the therapy (DLQI from 19 to 10, pain from 8 to 9 to 3/10 NRS).ConclusionIn extensive cases of HS, a combination of surgical and conservative therapy is necessary. We demonstrate that severe cases can be successfully treated with a combination of antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and surgical therapy.

Body: Introduction
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the apocrine glands, mainly affecting axillae, inguinal, and perianal areas. Patients suffer from recurrent inflammatory episodes, leading to the formation of painful nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts, and scars. The disease has a severe impact on the quality of life due to psychosocial distress, pain and mobility restrictions [1, 2].
      This case report shows a male patient battling a severe form of HS for over 20 years with underlying comorbidities. A combination of biologic, antibiotic, and surgical therapy was necessary to treat this recalcitrant case of HS. The aim of this report was to highlight the necessity of a combination of systemic and surgical treatment for advanced HS.
    
    
      Case Report
      In January 2024, a 49-year-old male presented with a 20-year-long history of HS. Over multiple years, his condition had worsened. Upon presentation, he showed extensive fistulas and abscesses in the gluteal, femoral, and perianal regions with emphasis of the left side (Fig. 1a). There were extensive scars in both axillae after previous surgery and sinus tracts in atypical regions: on his abdomen, chest, on his lower right leg and behind both ears. His most recent treatment included 8 months of adalimumab 40 mg s.c. weekly and 3 months of oral clindamycin 300 mg bd and resulted in a further deterioration of his clinical status. Also, his comorbidities including heart failure (NYHA II-III, ejection fraction 35–40%) and hypochromic microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 7.8 g/dL) had not been addressed yet.

      The long-lasting inflammation of the skin had caused limited mobility with a restriction of movement of the left hip and contracture of the left knee: both joints could not be extended fully anymore. Moreover, he suffered from extreme fatigue and significant pain (NRS 8–9/10). His Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score showed a significant deterioration with a result of 19. In total, he presented himself with a case of Hurley stage III HS, an HS-PGA score of very severe disease and an International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4) score of 16.
      The patient showed extensive bilateral gluteal and femoral sinus tracts, with a particularly large sinus tract measuring 40 cm in diameter on his left buttocks. All fistulas were actively purulent and malodorous. His blood work showed elevated inflammatory markers, with leukocytes at 17.11/nL. Considering the failure of past systemic therapies, we implemented a new strategy focused on control of the inflammation, and surgical excision of the permanently damaged tissue.
      After hospitalization, we started an intravenous treatment with ertapenem 1 g daily for 14 days to downregulate the inflammation (Fig. 1a–c). Parallelly, the patient received iron carboxymaltose (500 mg FerApplic i.v.) and erythropoietin (20,000 IU s.c.) to treat his anaemia. After a few days, the clinical signs of inflammation improved and the patient’s inflammatory blood markers had decreased significantly, with leukocytes dropping to 7.42/nL.
      After addressing the overall inflammation and the comorbidities, the patient underwent extensive excision of the sinus tracts and scar tissue of the gluteal region and the left femoral area. The surgery was performed under general anaesthesia in combination with tumescence anaesthesia. Subsequently, the wounds were rinsed daily, and calcium alginate was applied in order to advance secondary intention healing until the granulation tissue was sufficient to be covered by a skin graft (Fig. 2a–c).

      Transfusion of two units of red blood cells, as well as infusion of iron carboxymaltose (500 mg FerApplic i.v.) and erythropoietin (20,000 IU s.c.), was necessary postoperatively in order to treat the coexisting anaemia. Four weeks after the excision of sinus tracts, we performed a split skin graft transplantation. The patients’ immobility caused by knee contractures was improved by daily physiotherapy.
      Following intravenous antibiotic treatment with ertapenem, we applied a combination of oral clindamycin 600 mg, rifampicin 300 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg, twice daily for 4 weeks to prevent the recurrence of inflammation. Within 3 months, the patient showed a significant improvement in pain levels (8–9/10 to 3/10) and in quality of life (DLQI score improved from 19 to 10). Furthermore, the surgical wounds healed successfully. Further surgical treatment was necessary for the atypically located sinus tracts (retroauricular, lower leg, chest). One year after surgery, there were no signs of further progression or recurrence of the disease.
    
    
      Discussion
      Severe cases of HS pose a significant treatment challenge for dermatologists. The goal of this case report was to highlight several important aspects of handling such complex cases.
      Management in this case relied on a multimodal approach, addressing both the inflammation and the irreparable tissue damage following a long-lasting and insufficiently treated course of the disease. The recently published version of the European HS guidelines differentiates between inflammatory cases of HS and non-inflammatory cases: the first should be treated with medical therapy while the latter requires a surgical approach [3]. In cases with both inflammation and irreparable tissue damage, a combination treatment is necessary.
      In our patient’s case, a key part of the therapeutic strategy was the combination of antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and surgical interventions, each targeting a distinct aspect of the disease pathophysiology. Intravenous ertapenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem, was administered to reduce the bacterial load typical of HS lesions, particularly anaerobic and gram-negative organisms. This allowed for better local control of infection before surgical excision. Postoperatively, oral clindamycin and rifampicin were continued due to their synergistic effect in targeting biofilm-associated bacteria. Metronidazole was added to enhance anaerobic coverage and support anti-inflammatory effects.
      In parallel, secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-17, was initiated to suppress the chronic inflammatory pathway central to HS. IL-17 is a key cytokine driving neutrophilic inflammation and tissue destruction in HS. Blocking IL-17 helps reduce inflammatory cell recruitment and contributes to long-term disease control [4, 5].
      Additionally, erythropoietin and intravenous iron carboxymaltose were administered to treat anaemia, which likely impaired wound healing and contributed to fatigue. Finally, radical surgical excision of the sinus tracts removed the chronically inflamed and irreparably damaged tissue and created a foundation for subsequent wound granulation and successful grafting. Healing by secondary intention ensured that residual infection could be adequately managed before definitive closure [3, 6, 7].
      The IL-17 inhibitor secukinumab played a significant role in maintaining the patient’s remission post-surgery. Choosing an appropriate systemic therapy is a crucial factor in achieving and sustaining long-term disease control in patients with refractory HS [8, 9].
    
    
      Conclusion
      HS is a complex chronic inflammatory skin condition that requires an individualized and often multimodal treatment approach. Therapeutic options include topical and systemic antibiotics, hormonal therapy, retinoids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologics such as TNF-α or IL-17 inhibitors. In advanced stages with irreparable tissue damage, surgical intervention becomes necessary to achieve long-term control.
      This case demonstrates that a combination of antibiotic therapy, surgical excision, and anti-inflammatory treatment with IL-17 blockade can successfully induce remission in severe HS. Importantly, biologics such as secukinumab offer a promising long-term treatment option, especially in patients with refractory disease. Their role has become increasingly relevant in the broader therapeutic landscape, as highlighted by recent literature discussing patient management in complex situations, including during COVID-19 vaccination campaigns [6].
      Dermatologists should consider a stepwise, patient-centred strategy that combines available therapies according to disease severity, prior response to treatments, and patient comorbidities [1, 9]. Further research is needed to optimize the sequencing and combination of these therapies to improve long-term outcomes in HS patients.

Title: Chronic Nipple Sinus Secondary to Demodex folliculorum Infestation: A Case Report

Abstract: Demodex folliculorum mites are common commensals of human skin. They typically inhabit pilosebaceous units. While often asymptomatic, infestation can lead to demodicosis. Involvement of the nipple-areolar complex is rare and can mimic other benign or malignant conditions.Herein, we report a case of a 30-year-old, healthy, single woman who initially presented with symptoms suggestive of a simple breast cyst. Eight months later, following a severe COVID-19 infection, she developed a discharging periareolar ulcer with associated nipple retraction. Surgical exploration revealed a sinus tract connecting the nipple to the ulcer. Histopathology of the excised tissue unexpectedly demonstrated heavy infestation of pilosebaceous units with D. folliculorum mites within chronic granulation tissue. Following surgery, the patient was treated with oral metronidazole and topical agents (tea tree oil wash and sulfur soap).

Body: Introduction
      Demodex folliculorum is a microscopic mite - a common ectoparasite residing within the pilosebaceous follicles of human skin, particularly on the face and eyelids. Its prevalence increases significantly with age, reportedly found in 25% of 20-year-olds, 30% of 50-year-olds, and potentially 100% of individuals over 90 [1]. While typically considered a harmless commensal, an overgrowth or altered host immune response can lead to various cutaneous manifestations, collectively known as demodicosis [1-3]. Immunosuppression (e.g., secondary to diabetes, chemotherapy, or certain medications like topical steroids) can predispose individuals to higher mite populations and subsequent inflammation [3,4]. Clinical presentations can range from subtle erythema, scaling, and pruritus (pityriasis folliculorum) to more pronounced papulopustular eruptions resembling rosacea or acne, and sometimes blepharitis when involving the eyelids [2]. A related species, Demodex brevis, typically burrows into sebaceous glands, including the meibomian glands, leading to dry eye disease [1,5].
      We report a rare case in which a heavy infestation of D. folliculorum was identified as the underlying cause of a chronic nipple sinus tract and associated nipple retraction in a young woman, initially misdiagnosed as an inflamed breast cyst.
    
    
      Case presentation
      A 30-year-old, single, non-smoking, healthy Bahraini woman with no significant medical history, except that she had received three doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in 2021, presented on February 17, 2022, with a three-day history of left breast pain and redness. Ultrasound revealed two adjacent superficial simple cystic lesions (10 mm and 8.2 mm) at the 2-3 o'clock position (Figure 1). Aspiration of the cysts yielded serosanguinous fluid. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was suggestive of an inflamed cyst. She was treated empirically with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and symptoms improved. Bacterial culture was negative at that time.
      
        Figure 1
        
          Breast ultrasound shows cystic lesions measuring 10 mm and 8.2 mm at the 2-3 o’clock position in the left breast (suggestive of simple cysts).
        
        
      
      In June 2022, she experienced a severe COVID-19 infection. Four months later (in October 2022), her symptoms recurred, and she started complaining of painless, bloody discharge from a small ulcer in the left periareolar region. It was located at the site of the previous cyst aspiration. General examination revealed acne-like lesions on her forearms and back. Left breast examination showed a small periareolar skin ulcer at the 2 o’clock position, with surrounding redness approximately 1 cm in diameter and associated nipple retraction. No definite breast lump or axillary lymph nodes were palpable. A repeat breast ultrasound demonstrated a 1 × 0.9 cm collection confined within the skin of the left areola at the 1 o’clock position, with no deeper collection identified.
      The patient started complaining of itching and requested excision of the cyst along with correction of the retracted nipple. On October 31, 2022, the patient underwent surgical exploration. Intraoperatively, probing of the retracted nipple revealed a sinus tract extending easily from the nipple orifice to the periareolar ulcer at the 2 o’clock position (Figure 2). We excised the sinus tract, including the periareolar ulcer, raised the retracted nipple, and closed primarily.

          Intra-operative picture showing the probe passed through the retracted left nipple to the site of the inflamed cystic area (the black line was drawn to show the periareolar line).
        
        
      
      Histopathological examination of the excised sinus tract and ulcer tissue provided the definitive diagnosis. Microscopic sections showed a dense dermal, chronic granulation tissue reaction. The overlying epidermis was hyperplastic and contained milia-like microcysts with pilosebaceous units heavily infested by D. folliculorum mites. These findings were interpreted as a chronic nipple skin sinus associated with significant Demodex infestation (Figures 3-4).

          One week post-operative, the nipple was normal despite a superficial infection with skin gaping, which healed completely.
        
        
      
      On her follow-up visit in December 2022, the left breast wound had completely healed, and the nipple retraction had resolved. She was started on a two-week course of oral metronidazole, with topical use of tea tree oil body wash and sulfur soap. However, the itchy, acne-like lesions on her forearms and back persisted. A biopsy was recommended, but the patient declined further investigation.
    
    
      Discussion
      D. folliculorum is an ectoparasite that inhabits human hair follicles and is more prevalent in males than in females. The pathophysiological mechanism of infection involves follicular distention and blockage by the mites, which feed on follicular cells [1]. Distention of follicular walls leads to antigen release. Epithelial hyperplasia and a host inflammatory response occur, potentially triggered by the mites themselves, their waste products, or associated bacterial infections such as Staphylococcus and Bacillus oleronius, which D. folliculorum mites carry [1]. Demodicosis often causes erythema, scaling, pruritus, papules, and vesicles within and around the infested follicles. This chronic inflammation involves both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses [2]. This can lead to tissue breakdown and the formation of sinus tracts. It seems likely that, under normal circumstances, there is a control mechanism that limits the population of Demodex mites. However, both local and systemic factors may create an environment that encourages their proliferation [6]. In general, infestation with Demodex mites is usually asymptomatic, but may be associated with skin disorders of the face, hyperpigmented patches, blepharitis, perioral dermatitis, or pustular folliculitis [6].
      Large numbers of Demodex mites can be seen in the skin lesions; their response to topical therapy with permethrin indicates their pathogenicity. Breckenridge (1953) found Demodex mites in 13% of routine skin biopsies from all parts of the body [7]. He noted that these mites rarely caused chronic inflammation of the nipple-areolar complex. Early reports by Garven and Glasg (1946) highlighted the existence of these mites in the human nipple [8]. Subsequent studies, such as Val-Bernal et al. (2010), identified Demodex incidentally in nipple-areolar complex autopsies [9], and Kuleshova et al. (2017) detected mites in nipple secretions [10], confirming their presence in this atypical location.
      Furthermore, Hoda and Cheng (2019) presented a case linking Demodex infestation to nipple pruritus, suggesting a potential role in localized symptoms [11]. Fidler (1978) found Demodex mites in 15 nipples [6]. They were seen in hair follicles or sebaceous ducts, but not in nipple ducts. Demodex mites play a significant role in the pathogenesis of eczema-like eruptions of the nipple [6]. Some patients with thick nipple discharge have shown D. folliculorum in nipple discharge cytology [6]. Demodicosis should also be included in the differential diagnosis of nipple eczema or nevoid hyperkeratosis [6,12].
      Diagnosis of nipple demodicosis can be challenging due to its rarity and nonspecific presentation, particularly in a young, non-smoking, healthy woman. Histopathological examination of biopsied tissue is often required for confirmation, demonstrating mites within the follicular units and usually showing a perifollicular inflammatory reaction [2].
      Our patient's initial presentation was consistent with an inflamed cyst, but the recurrence with skin ulceration and nipple retraction later necessitated further investigation. This nipple retraction likely resulted from chronic inflammation and fibrosis, associated with the sinus tract tethering the nipple inward.
      The correct diagnosis in this case was only possible via histopathology after surgical exploration of the sinus tract. This highlights the importance of considering atypical etiologies and obtaining tissue biopsies for histology in chronic, non-healing, or recurrent nipple-areolar lesions. The differential diagnosis of chronic inflammatory or ulcerative lesions in the nipple-areola region should include other serious pathologies, such as Paget's disease of the nipple, ductal carcinoma in situ, nipple adenoma, and dermatological conditions like eczema or psoriasis [12].
      The treatment approach worked very well in our patient by combining surgical excision of the affected tissue (sinus tract and ulcer) with anti-parasitic medication (oral metronidazole) and topical agents known to have activity against Demodex (tea tree oil and sulfur). Other reported treatments include topical 5% permethrin cream and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), with personal hygiene emphasized as crucial for management [1,2]. The successful resolution of the breast symptoms supports the diagnosis and the efficacy of the targeted treatment. Personal hygiene is considered one of the most important factors in eradicating these parasites [6].
      To the best of our knowledge, chronic nipple-areola sinus secondary to demodicosis has never been reported in Bahrain, which posed a challenge to us in the differential diagnosis of this case. The patient’s history of a severe COVID-19 infection preceding the recurrence warrants mention, although a direct causal link cannot be established. Immune deficiency following COVID-19 infections has been postulated to exacerbate conditions like demodicosis [13]. The persistence of itchy lesions elsewhere on our patient’s body, which she declined to have biopsied, raises the possibility of a more generalized demodicosis.
    
    
      Conclusions
      D. folliculorum infestation, though commonly reported on the skin, is a rare cause of chronic nipple and areolar pathology, particularly in our part of the world. This young, healthy woman presented with a chronic discharging sinus and associated nipple retraction following a COVID-19 infection, which likely lowered her immunity. Histopathological examination of excised tissue is essential for a definitive diagnosis. Treatment targeting the Demodex mites, along with surgical excision of chronically affected tissue, can lead to complete resolution of symptoms. Clinicians should include nipple-areola demodicosis as one of the differential diagnoses in such patients.

Title: A Classic Presentation of Acne Keloidalis Nuchae in a Black Male

Abstract: Acne keloidalis nuchae (AKN), also known as folliculitis keloidalis nuchae and nuchal keloid acne, is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder of the hair follicle. Predominantly occurring in the nuchal and occipital scalp, it can lead to keloid-like plaques and cicatricial alopecia. Primarily affecting people of color, more specifically African American individuals, it is associated with haircuts, friction, or trauma among a variety of other less common causes. The diagnosis is clinical with physical exam findings showing firm, dome-shaped papules or pustules, hypertrophic scars, inflammation, and alopecia. Although challenging as the disease progresses, management includes topical and systemic antimicrobials, corticosteroids, cryotherapy, laser therapy, and surgical excision. Early intervention is vital as it helps minimize the risk of permanent scarring and psychosocial impact. The following case report is about a young, African American male who presented to the outpatient clinic with findings concerning for AKN.

Body: Introduction
      Dermatologic conditions in people of color can present differently, and their prompt identification and management can impact lives drastically. This population, unfortunately, has been underrepresented in dermatology textbooks, research, and clinical trials, leading to inadequate training and education, which in turn leads to underdiagnosed and undertreated skin conditions in people of color. Diagnosing and treating these skin conditions appropriately is vital, as it can improve quality of life and mental health [1]. This case report focuses on one such skin condition that can easily be missed if not identified promptly and correctly. More commonly found in people with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes V and VI, acne keloidalis nuchae (AKN) is defined as persistent folliculitis forming keloid-like scars and cicatricial alopecia usually found on the nuchal and occipital scalp [1-3].
    
    
      Case presentation
      A 28-year-old African American male presented to an outpatient clinic with complaints of enlarging lesions on the nape of his neck that had been present since his early 20s. The patient reported occasional pruritus; however, denied pain, discharge, drainage, or systemic symptoms, including fever. The patient reported having close-shave haircuts in the past, after which the lesions would appear or worsen. He reported no history of keloids from prior injury, trauma, or scars. Additional medical history included keratoconus of his right eye, for which he had been following up with ophthalmology. He took brimonidine tartrate 0.2% solution ophthalmic drops thrice daily and used fluticasone propionate 50 mcg/actuation intranasally for allergic rhinitis. He did not report any other personal medical history; his only reported surgery was for his eye condition. His family history was non-contributory as there was no reported history associated with AKN, and he was not taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medications. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use and reported no known drug allergies.
      During his initial consultation, vital signs were documented as a blood pressure of 141/89 mmHg, a heart rate of 89 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and a temperature of 98.5° Fahrenheit (36.9° Celsius). The patient weighed 343 pounds (155.58 kilograms) and had a body mass index of 52.15 kilograms per square meter, making him clinically obese. His Fitzpatrick skin classification was type 6. The physical examination demonstrated well-circumscribed, dome-shaped papules and plaques along the occipital and nuchal scalp, measuring 11 centimeters from the lower edge of the eruption to the highest point of the rash (Figure 1).
      
        Figure 1

      Hyperpigmented, velvety plaques were also present on the posterior neck, indicating the presence of acanthosis nigricans. The diagnosis of AKN was made clinically based on the patient's history and physical examination. The eruption was classified as stage three AKN based on the size and distribution of the rash. The laboratory analysis had already been performed by his primary care physician and did not reveal any abnormalities. The patient was initially started on topical therapy, including corticosteroids and an antimicrobial wash, as well as oral antibiotics with doxycycline. He was also instructed on lifestyle modification, including avoiding short haircuts and wearing hats. At his follow-up visit three months later, slight improvement was reported by the patient and seen on exam; however, areas of alopecia surrounding the lesions were also noticeable (Figure 2).

      He continued to wear a do-rag, likely to hide the underlying lesions. He was then started on intralesional corticosteroids administered in the clinic. After inconsistent and only moderately effective treatments, due to the patient missing follow-up visits, and multiple failures of topical, intralesional, and oral therapies, it was determined that the patient may benefit from dermatology evaluation with consideration for laser therapy (Figure 3).

      Oral isotretinoin was deemed contraindicated by ophthalmology due to his ongoing eye disease and studies that suggest a link between the use of oral isotretinoin and worsening keratoconus. The patient was unfortunately lost to follow-up.
    
    
      Discussion
      The etiology of AKN is unknown; however, it is suggested that the disease process is due to chronic inflammation of the hair follicles due to a variety of predisposing or exacerbating factors. These factors range from close-shave haircuts, trauma, friction, heat, humidity, or infection. Other factors could include autoimmunity, excess androgens, seborrhea, or medication side effects (cyclosporin, lithium) [2,4].
      AKN is most often found in people with Fitzpatrick skin phototypes V and VI, with a prevalence in the African American population of 0.5% to 13.6% [1,5]. It typically presents after puberty and affects males more than females by a ratio of 20:1 [1,2].
      AKN occurs due to skin injury from repeated friction, trauma, or infection, which subsequently leads to an abnormal immune response [1]. This process causes scarring of the hair follicles, with the development of keloid-like scars and cicatricial alopecia [1].
      A thorough history should include a review of the haircut routine, trauma, identification of triggers that can cause chronic friction and infection, and a review of medications [2]. The physical examination should be thorough, involving inspection and palpation of the nuchal and occipital scalp. Examination findings may include firm, dome-shaped, inflammatory papules and pustules, keloid-like papules and plaques, and scarring alopecia [2,3].
      Comorbidities associated with AKN include several inflammatory scalp and general dermatologic conditions, such as chronic scalp folliculitis and hidradenitis suppurativa [6]. Importantly, AKN is also commonly comorbid with metabolic syndrome and its four components: diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and dyslipidemia [6]. As in the presented patient, acanthosis nigricans, a dermatologic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, is sometimes present with AKN. Evaluation may therefore include laboratory testing with a hemoglobin A1c and lipid panel [6].
      A clinical diagnosis based on the history and physical examination is typically easily made. Although not frequently needed, histological analysis may vary depending on the time of the biopsy. Neutrophils and lymphocytes around the isthmus of the follicle and naked hair shafts in the dermis can be seen. As the disease progresses, destruction of the sebaceous glands, chronic granulomatous inflammation with collagen deposits, and fibrosis can be observed. If there is fluid discharge, sinus tracts may be present [2,7]. Microbiologic studies can also be obtained to identify the presence of any primary or secondary infectious process [2]. AKN can be classified by lesion distribution and morphology. This further helps classify the lesions into classes I-IV [8]. Class I lesions are less than 3 mm, confined to a sagittal width. Class II lesions are between 3 and 6.5 cm in size, confined to a sagittal width. Class III lesions are greater than 6.5 cm or breach the clinical demarcation lines, but generally are restricted to the nuchal area. Class IV lesions are widespread and exceed the nuchal area [8].
      Treatment depends on the severity of the disease process; however, there is no optimal first-line therapy. The various management options should be provided to the patient, and shared decision-making between the patient and physician is typically preferred. However, it is essential to note that the overall treatment is somewhat difficult with unpredictable outcomes. Mild disease is treated with triamcinolone and topical retinoids for two to four weeks. Clindamycin solution is added if pustules are present [1]. Intralesional triamcinolone is an alternative treatment option for mild to moderate disease [1]. Topical antimicrobials, such as benzoyl peroxide or chlorhexidine, can help prevent secondary bacterial infections [2,9]. Other treatment options include oral isotretinoin, cryotherapy, oral doxycycline, phototherapy, laser therapy, and surgery [9]. Laser therapy, particularly with a 1064 nm Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet) laser and an 810 nm diode laser, is most effective in improving the number and size of lesions [2,10]. Surgical excision is considered for extensive and/or refractory lesions; however, mild recurrences have been reported [11]. Maintenance therapy includes the use of topicals such as steroids, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids [2].
      Coexisting obesity has been linked to difficulty in managing AKN [12]. Deeper skin folds at the nape of the neck in obese patients may increase friction and irritation [12]. The heightened generalized inflammation associated with comorbid metabolic syndrome may also contribute to challenges in management [12]. Surgical interventions may be complicated by delayed wound healing and infection [12]. The surgical procedure itself may be more technically challenging in obese patients, as the increased vascularity associated with excess adipose tissue complicates dissection and closure [12].
      Painful interventions such as cryotherapy, steroid injections, laser treatments, and surgery may be taxing on the patient and contribute to poor compliance with the management plan [2].
      Some differential diagnoses include psoriasis, acne conglobata, acne vulgaris, acneiform eruptions, folliculitis decalvans, hidradenitis suppurativa, bacterial folliculitis, acne mechanica, tinea barbae, perifolliculitis capitis abscedens et suffodiens, or cancer [2,3].
      The disease progression of AKN is slow, and there is no definitive cure. Early interventions help improve outcomes and potentially limit progression and scarring [3].
      Complications such as recurrence and permanent scarring can occur [5]. The psychological impact can be distressing due to multiple factors, including its lifelong duration and cosmetic disfigurement [3]. AKN can be associated with metabolic syndrome, hidradenitis suppurativa, and pseudofolliculitis barbae [1].
      Patient education is a vital step in management. Avoiding frequent close shaves, short haircuts, and picking and scratching can help prevent potential exacerbations [1,9]. Additionally, minimizing irritation from helmets, hats, or clothing can also help prevent potential exacerbations.
      AKN often requires a multidisciplinary team for its management. It can be treated within the primary care setting; however, if laser or phototherapy is required, referral to dermatology would likely be necessary. Access to optimal management may be challenging due to the limited availability of specialty treatment centers and the lower socioeconomic status of those primarily affected. If surgical excision is deemed appropriate, consultation with a specialist is required. Lifestyle modification, such as weight loss, may be assisted by a dietitian or nutritionist. Optimizing care of comorbid metabolic conditions such as diabetes and dyslipidemia may improve outcomes. Psychotherapy should be considered in patients at risk for mental health disorders due to the psychological impact of the disease process.
    
    
      Conclusions
      AKN, a chronic inflammatory skin condition involving the hair follicle, can ultimately lead to keloid-like scarring and permanent alopecia. It is a skin condition found in people of color, particularly Fitzpatrick skin phototypes V and VI. Identifying and treating this condition early on can lead to the prevention of progression and irreversible scarring. Although various treatments are available, including topical and systemic therapies, intralesional corticosteroids, cryotherapy, laser therapies, and surgical excision, outcomes are often suboptimal, and recurrences are frequent. Poor outcomes may be secondary to the availability of specialty interventionalists and the cost of effective treatment strategies such as laser therapy. The disproportionately high incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome in communities of color predominantly affected by AKN may also contribute to treatment difficulties. Poor compliance may be attributed to the pain and discomfort associated with many of the therapeutic options, such as cryotherapy, injections, lasers, and surgical intervention. This case report aids in recognizing this disease process in a patient population that is underrepresented in dermatology textbooks and clinical research, so that early interventions can be implemented to avoid poor outcomes. Continuing investigations into management strategies and barriers to effective treatment are warranted to address this pervasive syndrome.

Title: Climate Change, Natural Disasters, and Cutaneous Fungal Infections

Abstract: ABSTRACTFungal infections are an important source of morbidity and mortality that can manifest as superficial or invasive diseases. Diagnostic techniques for human fungal pathogens remain problematic, and multi‐drug resistance is emerging. This review addresses the potential emergence of new fungal pathogens in changing environments and reported instances of cutaneous fungal infections after natural disasters. Global warming does more than increase the mean global temperature; it is associated with changing precipitation patterns and major climatic events. With natural disasters, niches are created for the proliferation of fungal pathogens affecting humans across previously existing geographical boundaries. Here, we reviewed reports of cutaneous fungal infections after natural disasters, including earthquakes, floods, tsunamis, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Of importance is the potential for thermal adaptation leading to the evolution of new human pathogens, exacerbated by the elevated environmental fungal levels in disaster situations. Studies have documented higher risks of contracting typical tinea infections, as well as opportunistic, trauma‐related infections by environmental fungi. The latter is especially concerning due to atypical clinical presentations that could lead to treatment delays, antifungal resistance, and systemic complications. These support the importance of considering climate change as affecting the adaptation of these pathogens and the consequences of this change for human populations. A One Health framework should be advocated to address the impact of climate change on dermatological care.

Body: 1
      Introduction
      Climate change has brought about more frequent and intense natural disasters and weather events in recent years [1]. It is not uncommon to have infectious disease outbreaks after natural disasters, which can be acquired from inhalation or cutaneous inoculation of fungal spores [2]. Pathogenic fungi can be displaced from their natural habitats during a disaster and manifest in areas outside their normal range, coming into contact with injured individuals [2]. Therefore, climate change can alter the geographic range and vectors of pathogenic fungi, causing an emergence of diseases where they were not previously reported.
      The epidemiology of cutaneous fungal infections—affecting up to one quarter of the world's population—is affected by climate change [3]. According to the International Society of Dermatology Climate Change Committee, dermatophytes (e.g., Trichophyton, Microsporum, Epidermophyton) show strong evidence of climate sensitivity, thriving under high‐temperature and high‐humidity conditions [1]. Climate migration has been linked to an increased incidence of tinea capitis affecting predominantly children, including those caused by the less frequently encountered pathogens in the Western hemisphere (e.g., Trichophyton soudanense, Microsporum langeronii) [4]. In the Indian subcontinent, an increased incidence of heat waves, among other factors such as abuse of over‐the‐counter medications, has been linked to an epidemiological shift whereby Trichophyton mentagrophytes has displaced Trichophyton rubrum as the dominant pathogen in the causation of superficial fungal infections [1, 5, 6]. This trend underlies a significant treatment challenge due to the development of antifungal resistance concerning the current epidemic of an anthropophilic “clonal offshoot” of T. mentagrophytes, now known as Trichophyton indotineae [7].
      Based on the ecological niche, dermatophytes can be classified as anthropophilic (e.g., 
T. rubrum
), zoophilic (e.g., T. mentagrophytes), or geophilic (e.g., Nannizia gypsea [formerly Microsporum gypseum]). It is conceivable that during natural disasters or extreme weather events, the release/dispersal of fungal spores, fluctuations in temperature and humidity, as well as damage to the skin barrier stemming from wounds or dermatitis, may create points of entry for uncommon dermatophytic fungi (e.g., Acremonium, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Fusarium) [2]. An infection by zoophilic or geophilic dermatophytes may manifest atypical clinical presentations (e.g., swelling, nodules, pustules) that can increase the risk of misdiagnosis as bacterial infections or non‐infectious dermatitis [8]; therefore, it is advisable for healthcare providers—especially in regions where climate‐sensitive fungal pathogens were once considered rare—to remain vigilant and consider testing for possible fungal infections.
    
    
      2
      Climatic Variables
      Even minor or gradual changes in temperature, moisture, and wind patterns might affect fungal growth, distribution, and dispersal [9]. For pathogens adapted to infect the human skin (i.e., dermatophytes), tinea pedis and onychomycosis may be diagnosed more frequently during spring and summer seasons, as well as during “El Niño” characterized by increased rainfall and higher temperatures [10]. At a coastal region in Bangladesh, a survey conducted over a short span of 2 years (2015–2017) found a 16% increase in tinea diagnoses, while no significant changes were found for acne, psoriasis, or seborrheic dermatitis [11]. In a study of 150 United States (US) military personnel transferred to the tropical region of Panama, 10 new cases of tinea corporis and 5 new cases of tinea cruris were identified [12]. Under varying humidity conditions, the mycelium of T. mentagrophytes penetrated the stratum corneum faster at 100% humidity, while no penetration was observed at 80% humidity [13].
      Seo et al. conducted a retrospective analysis of 116,903 patients diagnosed with superficial fungal infections—mostly tinea pedis and onychomycosis—in Korea [14]. Their findings showed a significant positive correlation between patient visits and increasing temperatures as well as humidity, while wind speed and sunshine duration exhibited a negative correlation with patient visits [14]. In contrast, in tropical regions such as Thailand, an analysis of 185,202 outpatients found that the risk of diagnosing dermatophytosis was up to twice as high when the temperature decreased to about 20°C compared to the mean temperature of 28°C [15]. Authors attributed this finding to skin barrier damage caused by the cold, arid local climate [15].
      Unlike ectotherms such as insects and reptiles, immunocompetent humans acquire fungal infections less frequently due to a combination of immune factors and endothermy [9, 16]. The latter excludes most fungi which are restricted to growing at 12°C–30°C except for pathogenic strains (≤ 1% of total fungal species) [9, 16]. The maintenance of an ambient temperature at 37°C—a condition that inhibits approximately 80% of soil and plant fungi—as well as the ability to develop fevers, has been proposed as an adaptive advantage throughout human evolution [9, 16]. For every 1°C gained in body temperature in the range of 30°C–42°C, approximately 6% of the fungal species are excluded as potential pathogens [9].
      As global ambient temperatures rise, there is an increased risk of fungi acquiring thermotolerance (i.e., thermal adaptation) (Figure 1) [2]. Fungi can evolve thermotolerance, which is defined as “the ability to grow at mammalian and higher temperatures,” allowing for them to become pathogenic [16]. Under experimental conditions, filamentous fungi can gradually adapt to increasing temperatures [17]. Accordingly, thermotolerant fungi are already abundant in sub/tropical climates, including molds such as Fonsecaea pedrosoi, causing chromoblastomycosis, dimorphic fungi such as Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Penicillium marneffei, and yeasts such as Cryptococcus gattii [1, 16]. Thermotolerance is manifest among Basidiomycetes (e.g., Cryptococcus) [9], which has the potential to become a major contributor of new fungal pathogens [16]. Furthermore, thermal adaptation may be increasingly facilitated by the observed decline in average human body temperatures, which has been recorded at 0.03°C per birth decade since the Industrial Revolution in the US [18]. Since some non‐pathogenic fungi also exhibit thermotolerant features [19], further studies on host–microbe interactions (e.g., immune response, virulence factors) are warranted to better detect the emergence of new fungal pathogens, especially in view of the 1.55°C increase in the global temperature in the past decade with 2024 being the warmest year on record [20].
      
        FIGURE 1
        
          Emergence of cutaneous fungal infections due to climate change. Rising global temperatures (+1.55°C over the past decade) is hypothesized to be a driver of thermal adaptation of environmental fungi, thereby increasing its pathogenic potential. Extreme weather events and natural disasters facilitate the dispersal of fungal spores. In disaster situations, a combination of skin trauma, psycho‐emotional stress, congregate living settings, and exposure to high temperature and humidity predisposes individuals to cutaneous fungal infections. Healthcare providers should remain vigilant about testing for possible fungal infections as these patients may present with atypical signs or symptoms. Targeted treatments are warranted considering the risk of systemic complications (mucormycosis, chromoblastomycosis) and drug resistance. Surveillance efforts of new and emerging fungal pathogens in the era of climate change are warranted.
        
        
      
    
    
      3
      Ambient Conditions
      Skin surface temperatures (29.8°C–34.7°C) are lower than the body's internal temperature (37°C), ranging from 34.7°C for the anterior neck, nasolabial, perioral, eyelid, and forehead regions, 33.8°C for the palm, and 29.8°C–30.1°C for the left and right sole [21]. Hence, a lower thermal adaptation threshold is conceivable for environmental molds or yeasts for establishing cutaneous infections [19]. One example is Fusarium solani—an uncommon cause of tinea pedis and onychomycosis—that can grow up to 34.3°C [22, 23, 24]. Other nondermatophyte molds have also demonstrated keratinase activities in vitro (e.g., Acremonium, Aspergillus, Scopulariopsis, Neoscytalidium) [25]. Molds are ubiquitous and can be found in the air, soil, and water. Their abundance and distribution depend on climatic and environmental factors, including ambient temperature and moisture [5, 26, 27].
      Even though the human body has protection given by endothermy, outside the body there is potential for the proliferation of microorganisms with developing thermotolerance to colonize these surfaces, and not exclusively at wound sites. Before (internal) systemic changes associated with thermal adaptation become evident with ensuing global warming, those happening on the surface of the human skin may develop visibly sooner. Climatic shifts in temperature and rainfall can contribute to the geographic expansion of cases, as suggested for blastomycosis [28].

      Risk of Cutaneous Fungal Infections Associated With Natural Disasters
      Disruptive events at large scale, including major disasters such as earthquakes, extreme temperatures, drought, mass movements, extreme weather, floods, fog, volcanic activity, wildfires, and more, can trigger the dispersal and spread of fungal infections. Such natural disasters can disrupt fungal habitats [2, 10]. Fungi can appear superficially on the skin due to atmospheric transmission, even in indoor environments. Environmental disruptions that can disperse and aerosolize fungi or implant them via traumatic wounds (e.g., lacerations, abrasions, contusions) result in infections by previously very rare or unknown species of “emerging” fungal pathogens that affect human health (Figure 2) [30]. The movement of infection vectors (e.g., animals) outside of their natural habitats is another concern [13].

        4.1
        Earthquakes
        Earthquakes can disturb airborne fungi in dust, cause injuries, create unsanitary living conditions, and may trigger tsunamis introducing moisture. A comparison of dermatology outpatient visits found a significantly higher incidence of superficial fungal infections 3 months after an earthquake took place in Turkey (17.4% [205/1178]) compared to the same period from the year before (13.2% [117/889]), with the most common diagnosis being tinea pedis [31]. In contrast, 6 months after the earthquake, a higher incidence of pruritis and noninfectious dermatitis was found compared to the 3‐month period [31]. After Ecuador experienced a 7.8‐magnitude earthquake in 2016, an assessment of dermatological conditions in 214 patients identified dermatophytosis (15.9% [34/214]) as the most common [32].
        Following the Great East Japan Earthquake that preceded the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, a survey of environmental fungi found inside and surrounding evacuated homes was conducted in 2012–2013, which found elevated levels—exceeding 52,000 colony‐forming units (CFU)/m3—inside these homes during the summer [33]. Commonly detected molds included Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, and Penicillium [33], which have shown pathogenic potential in causing dermatomycoses [25, 34, 35, 36, 37]. In 2016, another 7.0‐magnitude earthquake took place in Japan, of which an unusual case of onychomycosis caused by Aspergillus subramanianii—with high in vitro resistance against fluconazole, itraconazole, and miconazole—was reported in a young, healthy female patient [38]. The patient presented with proximal yellow–brown nail discoloration and paronychia of the left hallux, was unresponsive to terbinafine 125 mg/day for 1 month prior to obtaining culture results, and was later successfully treated using topical efinaconazole 10% [38]. The authors attributed this case to the increased levels of dispersed fungal spores similar to the 2011 incident [38].
        In addition to direct trauma, exacerbation of inflammatory skin disorders—secondary to the increased psychological burden during disaster events—and concomitant infections or infestations may further predispose victims to cutaneous fungal infections [39]. In areas with infrastructure damage post the Great Hanshin Earthquake, 34%–38% of atopic dermatitis patients reported worsening of symptoms, compared to only 7% in areas without damage [40]. After two sequential 7.0‐magnitude earthquakes in Turkey in 1999, dermatological examinations of 1200 survivors found non‐infectious dermatitis, infestations, and infections (including tinea pedis) in 3.3% (40/1200), 6.6% (79/1200), and 2.9% (35/1200) of cases, respectively [41].
        Diseased animals are another risk factor that can lead to outbreaks of cutaneous fungal infections. Following an earthquake in Nepal, Asokan and Vanitha proposed a One Health approach in response to the higher risk of zoonotic infections resulting from the displacement and injuries of animals and livestock [42]. This proposal includes establishing a joint surveillance network between human and animal healthcare providers, expanding emergency medical care to veterinary facilities, and improving access to diagnostic testing [42].
      
      
        4.2
        Tsunamis and Flooding
        Cutaneous fungal infections—both typical (e.g., dermatophytosis) and atypical (e.g., chromoblastomycosis, mucormycosis)—are a recognized risk during major flooding events, including tsunamis [4, 43]. Dermatologists are advised to test and identify possible fungal infections, and initiate targeted treatments as certain environmental fungi can cause systemic complications with resistance against standard antifungals [43]. After severe flooding hit Nepal in 2017, a dermatology department saw a 48% increase in patient visits for skin diseases of both infectious and non‐infectious etiologies [44]. Superficial fungal infections—mostly tinea cruris—accounted for over half of the infectious cases, while contact dermatitis was the most common non‐infectious etiology [44]. Interdigital tinea pedis can also be observed after a flood [45]. While skin lesions due to trauma are the most common during the immediate periods after a flood, infections begin to take place as evacuees congregate in shelters with sub‐standard sanitary conditions [46]. Environmental disinfection (e.g., bleach) triggering contact dermatitis, and psycho‐emotional stress causing exacerbation of pre‐existing skin conditions, can further predispose individuals to fungal infections [46].
        The tsunami triggered by the 9.0‐magnitude earthquake on December 26, 2004 affected coastal areas spanning South Asia and East Africa [47]. A clinical assessment of 235 survivors by two dermatologists—totaling 265 skin disease diagnoses—revealed a high prevalence of infections or infestations at 32.5% (86/265), most of which were attributed to superficial fungal infections, especially tinea corporis, likely due to the submersion in water [47]. Concomitant high prevalence of atopic dermatitis (29.8% [79/265]) and skin traumas (29.4% [78/265]) was also reported that compromise the skin barrier, as well as the risk of bacterial mixed infections [47]. A case of mixed fungal infection—with dermatophytes and non‐dermatophyte molds—was reported following a severe flood in Bangladesh in 2022 [48]. The patient presented with sino‐orbital symptoms in addition to an annular rash; histopathological examination and culture of the orbital mass and skin revealed 
Aspergillus fumigatus
 and Trichophyton interdigitale, respectively [48]. Liposomal amphotericin B treatment was switched to voriconazole after obtaining culture results, and clinical resolution was achieved [48].
        Misdiagnosis and treatment delay can severely impact the outcome in patients with atypical clinical presentations caused by environmental fungi. In a case report, a patient who sustained multiple injuries from a flood presented with purulent ulcers of the limbs [49]. Surgical debridement and empirical antibiotic treatments were ineffective; signs of necrosis of his chest and thigh were later observed [49]. Histopathologic examination revealed fungal elements consistent with those of cutaneous mucormycosis, and liposomal amphotericin B was administered; despite this, necrotic areas expanded, warranting further debridement, and Apophysomyces elegans was identified [49]. In a similar case, a tsunami survivor with trauma‐related polymicrobial infection developed necrotizing fasciitis, which led to sepsis [50]. One week after admission, histopathologic examination confirmed the presence of 
A. elegans
, and liposomal amphotericin B treatment was initiated [50]. Authors noted that patients with polymicrobial infections—who sustained soft‐tissue injuries from an area affected by natural disasters—should be promptly tested for possible fungal infection [50].
      
      
        4.3
        Hurricanes and Tornados
        In addition to damaged infrastructures, dispersed fungal spores, and skin traumas, flooding that often coincides with tropical cyclones may further create favorable conditions for fungal growth [51, 52]. In particular, one year post Hurricane María, indoor fungal levels were measured 1.4–2.7 times higher in homes that suffered flooding damage compared to non‐flooded homes [53]. A transient increase in Aspergillus was reported during this period [53]. Similar findings were reported after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, where homes that sustained extensive water damage had high fungal levels up to 67,000 CFU/m3—with Aspergillus niger as the most commonly identified species [54]. Both indoor air and surface revealed 4‐fold higher mold spore counts compared to outdoor air samples, which puts evacuees at risk when they return to their homes [55].
        Although a direct link between indoor mold exposure and the development of dermatomycosis has not been established, it is conceivable that higher quantities of infectious propagules (e.g., arthroconidia, conidia) on surfaces facilitating fungal adhesion would increase the risk of superficial infections [56]. A parallel can be drawn with mycotic skin or nail dusts—yielding viable dermatophytes and non‐dermatophyte mold isolates—generated during podiatric care [57], where fungal aerosolization as a result of nail abrasion treatments has been recognized as a potential occupational hazard causing superficial and respiratory tract infections.
        Soon after Hurricane Katrina, among rescue workers who were often submerged in water for prolonged periods, cases of tinea corporis were reported from two locations among other dermatologic conditions [58]. A rare case of systemic chromoblastomycosis, with multiple purulent lesions on the face, was reported in a young farm worker following Hurricane Katrina [59]. Initial presentation led to empirical antibiotic treatments, which were switched to amphotericin B treatment based on the suspicion of fungal infection that was later confirmed by histopathologic examination [59].
        Hurricane Harvey, a category 4 event that brought disastrous flooding to southeast Texas (USA) in August 2017, significantly increased the risk of skin diseases, especially when contact with floodwaters are reported [60]. A survey of 403 survivors reported that 7.2% (29/403) and 12.4% (50/403) were affected by tinea pedis and skin irritation, respectively [61]. Furthermore, ethnic minorities (e.g., non‐Hispanic Black patients) and individuals who lost employment report a higher risk of posttraumatic stress and limited access to healthcare, both of which may further increase the risk of dermatological diseases [61].
        Healthcare providers are advised to be cognizant of locally acquired fungal infections that have the potential to become invasive—especially concerning vulnerable, immunocompromised individuals—and to conduct confirmatory testing as appropriate [62]. Three cases of chromoblastomycosis—commonly caused by Fonsecaea pedrosoi following trauma caused by soiled foreign debris—were reported after hurricane Ike, with unusual clinical presentations that initially led to the suspicion of non‐melanoma skin cancers [63]. Histopathologic examinations revealed characteristic pigmented brown muriform fungal cells, along with hyperplasia, fibrosis, and multinucleated giant cells [63].
        After a tornado landed in Joplin (Missouri, USA) in 2011, 13 patients with suspected cutaneous mucormycosis—with positive cultures for saprophytic Apophysomyces trapeziformis—were identified [64]. It is suspected that A. trapeziformis spores were carried along the tornado's path and inoculated into these patients through foreign debris [64]. All patients were immunocompetent and suffered multiple wounds including fractures, blunt and/or penetrating trauma, and presented with subcutaneous necrosis [64]. Of the 6 patients who received ineffective treatments for mucormycosis prior to obtaining culture results—reflecting a potential knowledge gap regarding molds causing subcutaneous infections during a natural disaster—four died [64].
      
    
    
      5
      Conclusions
      There is an opportunity to improve dermatology care in response to the growing challenges posed by climate change. As healthcare providers increasingly encounter uncommon cutaneous disorders—such as infections by environmental fungi that can mimic bacterial infections or mixed bacterial‐fungal infections—related to extreme weather events and natural disasters, a detailed history‐taking is advisable [27, 65]. Testing for possible fungal infection should not be overlooked in disaster situations (Figure 1). Due to the effects of rising global temperatures, environmental fungi may acquire thermotolerance thereby elevating their pathogenic potential, especially concerning our growing aging population [26]. This risk could be exacerbated by the abrupt ecological disturbance brought about by natural disasters that increases the risk of direct contact (e.g., trauma, submersion in water, congregated shelters) [26]. Increasing education and expanding access to diagnostic testing remain key to ensure that appropriate treatments are initiated. Direct microscopic examination and histopathologic examination can detect the presence of fungal elements; however, genus‐ or species‐level identification often requires culture which can be impractical in emergency situations due to the long incubation period and low sensitivity [43]. Recent developments in DNA‐based detection methods (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) may help address this challenge. Further surveillance efforts on new and emerging fungal pathogens are warranted to better inform future public health actions.

Title: Effect of CO2
 Fractional Laser PreTreatment in Photothermal Therapy Using Ethosome Gold Nanoparticles: A Preliminary Study

Abstract: ABSTRACTBackgroundThe selective photothermolysis of sebaceous follicles with topically applied gold nanoparticles, followed by light exposure, shows good efficacy for acne treatment. Methods such as sonophoresis or CO2 fractional laser can help to deliver gold nanoparticles efficiently. Additionally, ethosomes are introduced to enhance the skin penetration of gold nanoparticles.AimsThis study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of the combination of CO2 fractional laser and gold photothermal therapy for acne.Patinents/MethodsTwenty‐four patients with moderate to severe acne were involved. They were randomly divided into two groups: Group 1 received CO2 fractional laser treatment followed by ethosome gold nanoparticle ampule application, while Group 2 applied the ampule with sonophoresis. After ampule application, all patients underwent long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser treatment (1064 nm wavelength, fluence 4.5 J/cm2, frequency 10 Hz, pulse duration 0.3 ms, and spot size 10 mm). Clinical evaluation, biopsy, and blood tests for gold detection assessed the effectiveness and safety of the treatments.ResultsEthosome gold photothermal therapy demonstrated significant clinical and histological improvements in acne vulgaris among Asian patients, showing no serious adverse effects or systemic absorption of gold nanoparticles.ConclusionsPatients treated with CO2 fractional laser pretreatment before ampule application showed reductions across all acne lesion types, including comedones, and experienced improvement in acne scars.

      Introduction
      Photothermal therapy (PTT) has emerged as a promising treatment modality for a wide range of dermatological conditions, including acne vulgaris, a prevalent and often distressing skin disorder [1]. Acne affects millions of individuals worldwide. It manifests through inflammatory lesions, comedones, and, in severe cases, cystic nodules, leading to significant physical and psychological impacts. The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial, involving overproduction of sebum, hyperkeratinization, inflammation, and proliferation of Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes), a bacterium that thrives in an anaerobic environment of clogged hair follicles.
      Traditional acne therapies including topical retinoids, antibiotics, and oral isotretinoin have provided substantial benefits. However, they have limitations such as antibiotic resistance, side effects, and patient compliance issues. In this context, photothermal therapy using gold nanoparticles, which utilizes light to generate localized heat capable of targeting specific tissues or microorganisms, offers a novel approach to treating acne by directly impacting C. acnes and sebaceous glands while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues.
      Recent advances in nanotechnology and laser technology have further enhanced the efficacy of photothermal therapy in dermatology. By employing nanoparticles that can absorb light at specific wavelengths, photothermal therapy can be precisely targeted, destroying C. acnes bacteria and reducing sebaceous gland activity. This precision can reduce inflammatory responses and promote faster healing with fewer side effects, making PTT a compelling alternative or adjunct to conventional acne treatments.
      Ethosomes are advanced lipid vesicles showing significant potential for transdermal drug delivery [2]. Their unique compositions, such as phospholipids, ethanol, and water, allow them to enhance the permeability of the skin barrier, enabling efficient delivery of active pharmaceutical ingredients through the skin. In this study, ethosomes were used to deliver gold nanoparticles. Methods such as sonophoresis and CO2 fractional laser can be used later to enhance skin penetration of ethosome gold nanoparticles. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of gold photothermal therapy after CO2 fractional laser pretreatment for acne.

      Materials and Methods
      
        2.1
        Patients
        Twenty‐four patients with moderate to severe acne who visited the Department of Dermatology, Korea University Ansan Hospital and Arumdaun Nara Dermatologic Clinic between June 2022 and February 2023 participated in this study. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Korea University Ansan Hospital (IRB no. 2022AS0124). Before undergoing the procedure, all participants were thoroughly informed about the potential benefits and risks associated with the treatment, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient.
      
      
        2.2
        Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
        Patients with a history of keloids, active skin infections, or uncontrolled systemic diseases were excluded from this study. Individuals who had received oral antibiotic treatments within the past 3 months, oral retinoid therapy within the past 6 months, or other laser treatments within the past 3 months were also excluded. Pregnant or lactating individuals were also excluded from this study.
      
      
        2.3
        Treatment Protocol
        Patients applied a local anesthetic cream (a eutectic mixture of 2.5% lidocaine HCl and 2.5% prilocaine; Taiguk Pharm Co. Ltd., Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea) to their faces for 40 min prior to the procedure. Each patient received three consecutive treatments spaced 2–3 weeks apart. They were randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 patients received CO2 fractional laser treatment followed by the application of an ethosome gold nanoparticle ampoule (ETHOSOME PTT, N‐FINDERS, Seoul, Republic of Korea), while Group 2 only applied the ethosome gold nanoparticle ampoule using sonophoresis. After ampoule application, all patients underwent a long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser treatment (V Laser wavelength, 1064 nm; fluence, 5.0 J/cm2; frequency, 10 Hz; pulse duration, 0.3 ms; and spot size, 10 mm with cooling off) in a sweeping technique. Ethosome gold nanoparticle ampoules contain gold and platinum nanoparticles, each sized between 50 nm and 100 nm with a spherical shape. During a single treatment, 2 mL of the ampoule was applied to the entire face. Group 1 received CO2 fractional laser treatment (U‐pulse, SNJ, Seoul, Korea) with 5 mJ, Density 1.0 mm (distance between dots), and 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 sized square scan. Group 2 received sonophoresis (Bellasonic 2X, LTRA Global, Gyeonggi‐do, Korea) 3/10 MHz, Intensity 5 for 10 min for solution penetration.
      
      
        2.4
        Clinical Assessment
        All evaluations were conducted by two independent dermatologists who were not involved in this study. Clinical photographs were taken at baseline, before each treatment session, and 2 weeks after the final treatment. These photographs were captured using a digital camera (EOS 80D; Canon KK, Tokyo, Japan) with patients positioned consistently under uniform lighting conditions. Changes in the number of papules, pustules, and comedones were recorded both before and after treatment.
        Before each subsequent treatment, patients were asked about any adverse effects they had experienced since the previous session. At the final visit, two blinded dermatologists performed overall assessments for each patient using the following scoring scales to evaluate general improvement:
No improvement1%–24% improvement25%–49% improvement50%–74% improvement75%–100% improvement

        Also, a patient survey was conducted on their improvement.

        Punch biopsies were obtained from acne lesions before and after treatment in one patient who consented. These specimens were then subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. To investigate the systemic absorption of gold nanoparticles, blood tests were conducted 2 weeks after the final treatment for four patients who had provided consent. It was sent to the Korea Institute of Science and Technology for ICP‐MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry).

        In Vitro Test of Acrylic Plate
        Ethosome was applied manually onto an acrylic plate. A long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser was then used for irradiation (Figure 1, left side). CO2 fractional laser was used for irradiation before ethosome treatment. A long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser was then used for irradiation (Figure 1, right side). After CO2 fractional laser treatment, ethosome was absorbed much better on the right side than on the left side. Therefore, the reaction was greater after treatment with a long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser on the right side.

        Statistical Analysis
        All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25 software. Changes in the number of lesions, including papules, pustules, and comedones, between baseline and the final treatment were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test. Additionally, a subgroup analysis was performed to compare Group 1 and Group 2 using both paired t‐test and the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

      Discussion
      Acne can be treated using various methods. Recently, alternative treatments have been developed for patients unable to take medications. Among these treatments, selective targeting of sebaceous glands and Cutibacterium acnes has gained attention [3]. One such treatment involves a 1726 nm laser that can be highly absorbed by sebaceous glands [4]. Another promising approach is gold photothermal therapy (PTT), which uses gold nanoparticles absorbed into the skin followed by laser irradiation at wavelengths that these particles can absorb well [5].
      Gold PTT has been extensively used in cancer therapy [6]. In 2015, Pithankar et al. [1] introduced its application in acne treatment by inducing photothermolysis of sebaceous follicles after absorbing gold microparticles into the skin. Since then, multiple studies have explored gold PTT for acne treatment [5, 7]. However, effective absorption of gold nanoparticles into the skin has been a significant challenge. Research has shown that ultrasound can improve absorption rates compared to simple topical applications or mechanical methods [8]. Using porcine skin, Lee et al. [9] have demonstrated that a combination of thulium laser and sonophoresis can enhance gold nanoparticle delivery, with subsequent long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser irradiation achieving over 50% destruction of sebaceous follicles by comparing the effects of three methods (sonophoresis alone, thulium laser followed by sonophoresis, and thulium laser followed by manual massage). The most significant sebaceous gland destruction occurred in the group treated with a thulium laser followed by sonophoresis.
      Building on this, we used CO2 fractional lasers as an alternative to thulium lasers for pretreatment to facilitate nanoparticle absorption. In an in vitro experiment using acrylic plates, pretreatment with CO2 fractional lasers followed by long‐pulsed Nd:YAG laser irradiation amplified therapeutic responses. Several techniques, including sonophoresis [10] and iontophoresis [11], have been tested to improve gold nanoparticle absorption. We used CO2 fractional laser pretreatment to enhance nanoparticle penetration before applying gold PTT. Sonophoresis is expected to enhance the follicular penetration of gold nanoparticles, whereas CO2 fractional laser pretreatment is expected to cause less selective penetration of gold nanoparticles, leading to diffuse dermis heating. This less selectivity may be related to improving diverse acne lesions with CO2 fractional laser pretreatment. Further studies are needed with a large number of patients to prove this.
      Considering a potential risk of excessive gold absorption, blood gold levels in a few volunteers were measured. Early concerns about systemic absorption of gold nanoparticles emerged during the introduction of gold PTT. Although a review of over 20 studies found no major side effects, it noted the presence of gold in tumor tissues and the liver for up to 174 days [12]. However, these studies were focused on cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and relapsing multiple sclerosis, with only one skin‐related research study available. Moreover, differences in the amount of gold nanoparticles used for acne treatment versus cancer therapy remained unclear as reviewed studies did not specify dosages.
      Despite initial concerns, Pithankar et al. [1] and others have reported no evidence of systemic absorption. Although intact skin minimally absorbs nanoparticles, CO2 fractional laser pretreatment can increase absorption. While this raised concerns about systemic side effects, in vitro tests using acrylic plates confirmed that gold nanoparticle absorption was significantly enhanced following CO2 fractional laser pretreatment, amplifying the response to long‐pulsed Nd:YAG lasers. Blood tests in volunteers showed no increase in systemic gold level, alleviating safety concerns.
      A recent study elucidated how gold‐based PTT can aid acne treatment [13]. It found that PTT could damage the mitochondrial respiratory chain in sebaceous glands, triggering ferroptosis in sebaceous cells and tissues.
      Our clinical trial showed that both sonophoresis and CO2 fractional laser methods significantly reduced papules and pustules. However, only those in the CO2 fractional laser group achieved a statistically significant reduction in comedones. This suggests that CO2 fractional laser pretreatment is more effective across a broader range of acne lesions. Additionally, fractional laser treatment likely contributed to secondary improvements of acne scars. Although pretreatment was intended to reduce procedure time by maximizing absorption, the time spent in wrapping treated areas for occlusion negated these savings. This study is limited by the fact that only one patient's biopsy was used to discuss the histological improvement. Further studies are needed to prove the effects of combining CO2 fractional laser and gold‐based PTT on more patients.

      Conclusions
      Ethosome gold photothermal therapy demonstrated significant clinical and histological improvements in acne vulgaris among Asian patients, showing no serious adverse effects or systemic absorption of gold nanoparticles. Patients treated with CO2 fractional laser pretreatment before ampule application showed reductions across all acne lesion types, including comedones, and experienced improvement in acne scars.

Title: Enhancing Skin Rejuvenation: Using of Engineered Exosome Content Treated With Oleuropein and Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein

Abstract: ABSTRACTBackgroundSkin aging, which is affected by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, leads to reduced elastin, collagen, and hydration levels.AimsThis study aimed to utilize modified exosomal content with treated Oleuropein and Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein to modulate gene and microRNA expression on the HFFF2 cells in vitro in order to reduce skin aging.Material & MethodsFe3O4@C/Oleuropein was synthesized using the hydrothermal method and confirmed by XRD, FTIR, and SEM. The MTT assay was conducted to test toxicity Following this, hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were treated with Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein and Oleuropein. Exosomes derived from the treatments were extracted by ultracentrifugation and evaluated by DLS and western blotting. HFFF2 cells were treated with exosomes derived from the treatments. The expression of the studied genes and related microRNAs was measured using qRT‐PCR. Also, the effect of exosomes derived from the treatments on HFFF2 cells was evaluated using flow cytometry.ResultsThe results showed that the expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes was significantly increased with Oleuropein (500 μg/mL) and Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein (250 μg/mL) treatments, especially when treated with exosomes derived from treatments. Moreover, the expression of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs was significantly downregulated, and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated in the HFFF2 cells, which was consistent with the exosome cargo derived from treated cells.ConclusionsExosomes can increase gene expression and reduce microRNAs associated with skin antiaging. Using modified exosomal content treated with Oleuropein and Fe3O4@CQD/Oleuropein is generally effective for preventing skin aging and also presents innovative methods for skin care.

Body: 1
      Introduction
      Currently, there is growing attention to skin rejuvenation because of the increase in people's life expectancy [1]. Skin aging is a complicated process that includes intrinsic (chronological) aging and extrinsic aging (e.g., sun, gravity, sleeping positions, and smoking). In both types of aging, there is a decrease in elastin, collagen, and loss in hydration leading to dryness and atrophy, with fine wrinkling in the skin [2, 3]. Fibroblasts, the predominant population responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, are the primary cause of skin senescence [4, 5].
      So far, researchers have extensively studied skin rejuvenation and proposed strategies for reducing skin aging, one of which is nanotechnology. Recent research shows that Fe3O4@CQDs significantly reduce ROS and inhibit pro‐inflammatory cytokines like TNF‐α and IL‐1β, addressing oxidative damage and aging pathways [6, 7]. Studies indicate that nanotechnology enhances cosmetic effectiveness by increasing capture efficiency, controlling drug release, improving physical stability, increasing moisturization, and enhancing ultraviolet (UV) protection [8].
      As more people become interested in natural cosmetics, Oleuropein, a phenolic substance found in olive leaves (
Olea europaea
), has been shown to have multiple skin advantages in clinical studies [9, 10, 11]. This secoiridoid has a special ability to change how different mechanisms of skin aging interact, such as oxidative stress, inflammasome activation, and the degeneration of the ECM [12, 13]. Studies show that it is able to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower the levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines including IL‐1β and IL‐6, and boost collagen production through pathways that are mediated by VEGF [14, 15]. Oleuropein increases collagen synthesis and inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade skin collagen and elastin [10, 11].
      Also, studies have shown that vitamin C is one of the compounds that affects skin rejuvenation. Vitamin C neutralizes free radicals and increases collagen, but Oleuropein does better in the role of removing ROS [16] while also inhibiting IL‐1β and caspase‐1‐mediated inflammasome activation, which is associated with both oxidative stress and inflammation [16]. Oleuropein is stable in formulations, unlike vitamin C, which degrades quickly [17]. Based on research, Retinol enhances skin texture but induces inflammation and necessitates the avoidance of UV exposure, whereas Fe3O4@CQDs decrease inflammation without impairing barrier function, and their magnetic targeting minimizes systemic exposure [18, 19]. In contrast to hyaluronic acid or niacinamide, which disperse widely, Fe3O4@CQDs improve spatial accuracy by concentrating active ingredients in photoaged or inflammatory regions [8, 20, 21].
      Another strategy for decreasing skin aging is exosomes, which have recently attracted significant attention as a therapy for skin rejuvenation [22]. Exosomes, a category of skincare agents, are increasing in popularity in the cosmetics industry because of their therapeutic and rejuvenating characteristics. They contain proteins, lipids, nucleic acids like microRNAs, and other compounds, which promote healing, hydration, and skin health. Exosomes can be modified by manipulating the culture medium or cell content and can repair skin damage such as sunburn and acne scars. They also contain bioactive compounds that protect the skin from environmental influences and minimize dark spots [23, 24, 25, 26]. On the other hand, microRNAs are one of the most major molecules present in exosomes [27]. MicroRNAs have been shown to have various activities in skin aging after differentially expressed microRNAs were identified based on the results of microRNA sequence analysis [28].
      Recent clinical trials and research have shown that both unmodified and modified (engineered) exosomes, particularly those sourced from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and fibroblasts, are efficacious in skin rejuvenation, wound healing, and enhancement of barrier function [29, 30, 31]. Also, exosome‐based creams represent an innovative method in cosmetic dermatology, proving efficacy in skin rejuvenation, hydration, pigmentation correction, and wound healing [31, 32].
      Research findings suggest that multiple signaling pathways play a role in the process of skin aging. Insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a key protein that stimulates keratinocyte growth [4]. Many downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and MAPK, are phosphorylated as a result of IGF1 activation of the insulin‐like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) [33]. IGF1 activates the PI3PK/AKT pathway, prevents dermal fibroblasts from UV‐B‐induced programmed cell death, and promotes cell survival via the MAPK pathway [34]. Also, epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a mitogenic polypeptide. It can activate and multiply myofibroblasts through the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways [35, 36]. EGF has a bright future in cosmetic antiaging applications because it plays an important role in upregulating fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in the skin [37].
      The present study aimed to utilize modified exosomal content with treated Oleuropein and Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein to modulate the expression of genes (IGF1, IGF1R, EGF, COL1A1, and ELN) and microRNAs (hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, hsa‐let‐7e‐5p, and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p) related to IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K pathways on the HFFF2 cells (in vitro) in order to reduce the aging process in the skin.

Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein Synthesis
        Fe3O4 (Cas No 1309‐37‐1; US Research Nanomaterials Inc., USA) nanoparticles (1 g) and d‐glucose (0.5 g: a compound of carbon origin) were suspended in 60 mL of distilled water, and the suspension was sonicated for 30 min. Subsequently, using the hydrothermal method, the suspension was incubated at 180°C for 5 h to synthesize Fe3O4@CQD in the Hydrothermal Autoclave. Thereafter, the synthesized Fe3O4@CQD was separated by centrifugation at 2000 g for min. After washing with water and ethanol, the samples were dried using a freeze dryer. In the following, 1 g of dried Fe3O4@CQD and 0.1 g of Oleuropein (32619‐42‐4; Sigma‐Aldrich, Germany) were suspended in 50 mL of distilled water and stirred by a shaker for 24 h to make Fe3O4@CQD/Oleuropein. Finally, the Fe@C/Ole NPs were gathered, washed, and dried using a freeze dryer.

          Characteristics of Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein Synthesis
          The synthesized Fe@C/Ole and functional groups of the particles were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy. The assay was carried out using an FTIR (SHIMADZU, Japan) device in a wave range of 500–4000 cm−1. X‐ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to assess the physical phase and crystal structure of Fe@C/Ole (CuKα, radiation, λ = 0.154056) at a scanning speed of 2° per minute (2θ range from 10° to 80°). Additionally, the size range, morphology, and aggregation level of the synthesized Fe@C/Ole were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (TESCAN MiRa3).
        
      
      
        2.2
        Cell Culture
        Human umbilical cord mesenchymal cells (hUC‐MSCs) were cultured according to Maleki et al. method [38]. Also, the fibroblast cell line (HFFF2) was purchased from the National Cell Bank of Iran (NCBI; Pasteur Institute, Tehran, Iran). Cell culture was performed using LG‐DMEM (Biosera, France), 10% FBS (Gibco, USA), Pen/Strep 100 μg/mL (Biosera, France), and then hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were incubated in 96% humidity containing 5% CO2 at 37°C. hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were subcultured respectively after 80% and 90% confluency using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA (Gibco, USA).
      
      
        2.3
        Cell Viability Assay (MTT Assay)
        hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells suspensions were seeded in a 96‐well culture plate, and after incubation for 24 h, hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were treated with a gradient concentration of Fe@C/Ole (0–1000 μg/mL) and Ole (0–2000 μg/mL). The plates were incubated for 24 and 48 h. Next, the medium was removed, and MTT (2‐(4,5‐dimethythiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added. After incubation for 4 h, the contents of the wells were removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the wells (the assay was repeated three times). The IC50 and IC25 were calculated by measuring the absorbance of the formazan crystals at a wavelength of 570 nm (Awareness Microwell Plate Reader Chromate 4300, USA).

          2.5.1
          Exosomes Isolation
          The cell culture supernatants were collected and transferred into centrifuge microtubes after 24 h of treatment with Fe@C/Ole and Ole. We extracted exosomes from exosomes isolated from cell cultures by ultracentrifugation using optimized protocols (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). In summary, the supernatants were centrifuged in the following order: 300 g, 2000 g, 10 min each, at 4°C, and 10 000 g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatants obtained were ultracentrifuged at 100 000 g for 90 min at 4°C. Next, the pellets were resuspended in PBS and ultracentrifuged at 100 000 g for 90 min at 4°C. Finally, the pellets were resuspended in 500 μL of PBS and stored at −80°C.

            Western Blot Analysis
            Isolated hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes (500 μL) and HFFF2‐derived exosomes resuspended in PBS were lysed in a lysis buffer. After centrifuging at 12 000 g for 12 min at 4°C, the supernatant containing protein was extracted and stored in a freezer at −20°C. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay. Quantified proteins were separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Thermo Scientific, USA) membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% BSA (Roche, Germany) for 2 h and then incubated with primary antibodies against CD63 (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐5275), CD9 (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐18 869), and β‐actin (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐47 778) for 18 h. After washing, the membranes were incubated for 1:15 h 15 min with a secondary anti‐rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz, USA, #sc‐2357). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) was used to detect the bands, and ImageJ software was used for analysis.

        Gene and microRNA Expression Analysis by qRT‐PCR

        Total RNA was extracted using EX6101‐RNX Plus Solution (SinaClone, Iran) at two levels: level 1. hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups (at IC25 concentration) for 24 h, and level 2. HFFF2 cells treated with hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes, HFFF2‐derived exosomes, and control groups (at Bradford assay concentration) for 24 h. Additionally, microRNAs were isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol at two levels: level 1. hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes and HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups (at IC25 concentration) for 24 h, and level 2. HFFF2 cells treated with hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes, HFFF2‐derived exosomes, and control groups (at Bradford assay concentration) for 24 h. The genomic DNA‐free RNA was quantified by the absorption 260/280 nm Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Then, cDNA was synthesized using the SinaClon First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (SinaClone, Iran) from total extracted RNAs according to the manufacturer's protocol; also, cDNA of extracted microRNAs was synthesized utilizing Stem Loop specific primers according to the instructions of the SinaClon First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (SinaClone, Iran).
        The relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF was analyzed by qRT‐PCR using the gene‐specific primers shown in Table S1. The relative expression of these genes was examined at two levels: level 1. hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups, and level 2. HFFF2 cells treated with hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes, HFFF2‐derived exosomes, and control groups. On the other hand, the relative expression of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs was examined using the microRNA‐specific primers presented in Table S2.

        Flow Cytometry (Exosome Toxicity Investigation)
        Cells were harvested and stained with DAPI 10X (4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole). All tests were performed in triplicate. The cell cycle and apoptosis progression were measured using an automated multicolor Flow Cytometry system. Flow Cytometry results were evaluated using FlowJo software (version 10). Flow Cytometry was used to measure the apoptosis rate in the HFFF2 cells treated with hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes and HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups. The HFFF2 cells were treated with two different concentrations of exosomes: 5.71 μg/mL (Bradford assay concentration) for HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups, and 6.088 μg/mL (Bradford assay concentration) for hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups.

        Physicochemical Properties of Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein
        The FT‐IR spectra of Fe3O4, Ole, Fe3O4@CQD, and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole are shown in Figure 1. The functional groups of the synthesized nanoparticles were identified. The strong band at 3350–3500 cm−1 confirmed the O‐H stretching bond of the phenolic part of Ole and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole. The peaks at approximately 500–600 cm−1 correspond to Fe‐O bonding, confirming the presence of Fe3O4 in the structures of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CQD, and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole. Fe3O4@CQD and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole exhibited a C=O stretching band at 1710 cm−1, signifying the presence of Fe3O4‐CQD. C–H stretching vibration signals were observed at 2920 cm−1. The characteristic vibration of the carbonyl groups in the Ole molecule was responsible for the signals observed at 1720 cm−1. The signal appeared at 1597 cm−1 as a stretching vibration and 1386 cm−1 as a bending vibration belonging to the functional groups C = C and O‐H, respectively. These results indicated the presence of Ole in Fe3O4@CQD/Ole (Figure 1A). The XRD pattern of Oleuropein attached to magnetite nanoparticles. All the signals in this pattern match the information from the standard XRD pattern of magnetite nanoparticles and confirm the crystallinity of the nanoparticles (Figure 1B). Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a spherical spinel structure showed signals at (311), (220), (440), (511), (422), and (400). The absence of (110) (2θ = 21.220) and (104) (2θ = 33.150) signals indicates that neither goethite (α‐FeOOH) nor hematite (α‐Fe2O3) phases were formed in the samples. Additionally, the binding of Oleuropein does not change the structure of Fe3O4@CQD; a broad peak is observed between 2θ = 12–28, which pertains to the overlap between Oleuropein and Fe3O4@CQD (Figure 1B). The morphology and size of the nanoparticles were determined using field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FE‐SEM) technique. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the sample revealed a range of particle sizes, ranging from 30 to 80 nm. Therefore, the image illustrates that the particles of the sample ingredients exhibited a high degree of homogeneity and possessed a consistent, symmetrical, and uniform distribution (Figure 1C).

        Viability Percentage (MTT Assay)
        Fe@C/Ole was evaluated as a conductive particle in terms of cell viability (Figure 3A), and the IC50 for the HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs was 484.52 and 511 μg/mL, respectively. Cell treatment was performed using IC25 ≃ 250 μg/mL, although cell growth inhibition was also observed in this treatment.
        
          FIGURE 3
          
            Cell viability. (A) HFFF2 and hUC‐MSCs cells treated with Fe@C/Ole in MTT assay. (B) HFFF2 and hUC‐MSCs cells treated with Ole in MTT assay.
          
          
        
        The effects of different concentrations of Ole on the viability of HFFF2 and hUC‐MSCs were studied (Figure 3B). The amount of the IC50 was estimated at 1035.4 μg/mL for the HFFF2 cells and 977.43 μg/mL for hUC‐MSCs; cell treatment was performed utilizing IC25 ≃ 500 μg/mL for cell treatment as an effective concentration. In summary, the results showed that Ole has cell inhibition and toxicity in very high concentrations (IC50 ≃ 1000 μg/mL), whereas Fe@C/Ole has them in low concentrations (IC25 ≃ 500 μg/mL).

          The exosomes isolated size from hUC‐MSCs treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and the control group were 68.8 ± 4.82, 58.3 ± 4.49, and 41.3 ± 3.03 nm, respectively, and the exosomes isolated size from HFFF2 cells treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and the control group were 67.3 ± 4.80, 42.6 ± 3.04, and 35.5 ± 2.82, respectively in the DLS analyses (Figures S1 and S2; Table 1). Z‐potential of the isolated exosomes was found to be −21.8 and −21.3 mV, which indicates the stability of exosomes in hUC‐MSCs treated with Ole and HFFF2 treated with Ole, respectively (Figure S3).

          Western Blot Analysis
          In the western blot image, protein bands with a size of 26 kDa indicated exosome membrane protein CD63 (Figure 4A,B). The protein CD63 was present in the Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups in both the hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells. Furthermore, the presence of protein bands at 24 kDa implies the existence of the exosome membrane protein CD9, as depicted in Figure 4C,D. We detected CD9 protein in the hUC‐MSCs, HFFF2 cells, and control group.

          3.6.1
          The Relative Gene Expression Treated With Fe@C/Ole and Ole
          In the ANOVA test, significant differences were observed between the treatments (Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control) in the HFFF2 cells, in terms of the relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes (p ≤ 0.05). Also, in the hUC‐MSCs, there was a significant difference in the relative expression (p ≤ 0.05) of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A, and ELN genes between the treatments. In contrast to other genes, no significant difference was observed in the relative gene expression of EGF in the hUC‐MSCs between the treatments (Table S3).
          The HFFF2 cells exhibited significant upregulation in the expression of the IGF1 (fold change: 3.14), IGF1R (5.3), COL1A1 (2.11), ELN (3.17), and EGF (3.5) genes in response to Ole treatment compared to the control group. Additionally, Fe@C/Ole treatment upregulated the expression of the IGF1R (2.03), ELN (1.94), and EGF (2.76) genes compared with the control group; however, there were no significant changes in the IGF1 and COL1A1 genes in the Fe@C/Ole group compared with the control group (Figure 5A). This trend of gene expression changes was similar in hUC‐MSCs, although, as mentioned, the EGF gene was not significant, and, unlike the HFFF2 cells, the COL1A1 gene was upregulated in the Fe@C/Ole treatment (Figure 5B).

          The Relative Gene Expression in Exosome‐Treated HFFF2 Cells
          According to the qRT‐PCR data and analysis of variance, there was a significant difference between HFFF2‐derived exosomes and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control treatments in terms of the relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes (p ≤ 0.05) in HFFF2 cells (Table S4).
          The findings indicated that the relative expression levels of IGF1 (2.6, 6.14), IGF1R (3.02, 6.11), COL1A1(3.73, 4.25), ELN (2.5, 3.25), and EGF (4.06, 4.14) were strongly upregulated in the HFFF2 cells treated with HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes with Ole compared to the control group, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Also, the results showed that the relative expression levels of IGF1 (3.4, 5.62), IGF1R (3.9, 6.02), COL1A1 (2.24, 3.32), ELN (2.4, 3.4), and EGF (3.61, 4.12) were significantly upregulated in the HFFF2 cells after the treatment of HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes with Fe@C/Ole compared to the control group, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Overall, the effects of HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes were similar; however, the effect of exosome treatment on gene expression was more significant than that of direct treatment with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to the control group.

          In the ANOVA, significant differences were observed between the treatments (Table S5). The results showed that hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs were significantly downregulated, whereas miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated in HFFF2‐derived exosome content, as well as in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosome content treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to the control (Figure 7A,B).

The present study evaluated the amounts of different microRNAs in HFFF2 cells treated with HFFF2‐derived exosomes and in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes in comparison to the control. The results indicated that the hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs were downregulated in HFFF2 cells between the treatments.

          Expression Correlation of microRNAs

          Our investigation demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the expression levels of specific microRNAs in modified exosomal content and the associated alterations in HFFF2 cells treated with these exosomes. This finding supports the concept that exosomal miRNAs are conveyed to recipient cells and influence their gene expression.
          The study examined expression correlation of several microRNAs, including hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p, in HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to exosomes of HFFF2 cells that were treated with exosomes derived from these cells. Significant positive correlations were consistently observed for these microRNAs in exosomes and exosomes of HFFF2 cells, indicating a robust influence on HFFF2 cellular responses. These results highlight the critical role of exosomes in intercellular communication and the regulation of gene expression within recipient cells (Table S7).

        Results of Exosome Toxicity Investigation
        The Flow Cytometry analysis results showed no significant variations in the viability percentage between HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, or the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 9). Flow Cytometry analysis of cell death data, including late apoptosis and necrosis, revealed no significant differences between exosome treatments. However, the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole significantly increased early apoptosis (p ≤ 0.05); on the other hand, there were no significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in early apoptosis between the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Ole and the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 9).

        The Flow Cytometry experiment demonstrated no significant differences in the viability percentage between hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and the control group in the HFFF2 cells. In addition, Flow Cytometry analysis of cell death data, including early apoptosis and necrosis, revealed no significant differences in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Ole compared with the control. However, there was a significant increase in late apoptosis in the hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Ole compared to the control (p ≤ 0.05); on the other hand, there were significant differences in early apoptosis and necrosis in the hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole compared to the control in the HFFF2 cells. Also, in late apoptosis, there were no significant differences in the hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole compared to the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 10).

      Discussion
      Previous research has revealed that the IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways are involved in skin rejuvenation [34, 35, 36, 37]. For these signaling pathways, we selected to investigate growth factors and their receptors, including the IGF1, IGF1R, and EGF genes, as well as the COL1A1 and ELN genes, which are primarily involved in skin renewal. Conversely, microRNAs modulate gene expression in the skin aging process. Research has identified multiple microRNAs linked to skin aging, which also target our chosen genes, notably the hsa‐miR‐29, hsa‐miR‐34, and hsa‐let‐7 families [49]. Research has shown that IGF1 is regulated by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [39] and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [40]; IGF1R is targeted by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [41], hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [42], hsa‐let‐7d‐5p [43], and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p [43]; EGF is regulated by hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [44]; COL1A1 is targeted by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [45], hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [46], and hsa‐let‐7d‐5p [47]; and ELN is regulated by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [48].
      Aging causes an increase in MMPs and a reduction in Collagen (COL1A1) and Elastin (ELN) levels [50, 51]. Thus, enhancing the production of Collagen (COL1A1) and Elastin (ELN) can effectively mitigate the effects of aging and promote rejuvenation [51, 52]. This study revealed that Ole and Fe@C/Ole (slow release) treatments increased COL1A1 and ELN mRNA levels in HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs that support the hypothesis of skin rejuvenation through treatments, as MMP9 (nonreported) has the ability to degrade collagen and elastin. Results were anticipated given the proven efficacy of Ole in many signaling pathways, including IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K [13, 53]. The effect of Ole can be attributed to its antioxidant effects, as well as its influence on the expression of growth factors such as IGF1 and EGF [10, 54, 55]. Generally, in our study, Ole treatment upregulated the expression of IGF1, EGF, and IGF1R, but IGF1 was not significant in Fe@C/Ole treatment (Figures 5 and 6). To date, reports have shown that antioxidant treatments, such as Ole, quercetin, and resveratrol, increase the expression of IGF1, EGF, and IGF1R genes [56, 57].
      The nanocomposite structure can improve Ole's stability and activity by preventing degradation in biological fluids. This is crucial for maintaining therapeutic levels during treatment [58]. Ole's effect on enhancing these growth factors and their receptors has been examined by targeting the MAPK signaling pathway [53, 59], which supports the rejuvenation process by inhibiting MMPs and promoting the production of COL1A1 and ELN (Figure 11). Furthermore, previous studies have highlighted Ole's ability to activate the PI3K signaling pathway and its significant antioxidant effects [60]. This pathway is known for its antioxidant properties; by increasing the expression of antioxidant cascades within the cell's nucleus and mitochondria, it actively inhibits the aging process [61]. Additionally, reducing MMP activity and blocking inflammatory pathways—such as those involving prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), nitric oxide (NO), and interleukin 6 (IL‐6)—promotes the synthesis of collagen (COL1) and elastin (ELN) (Figure 11).

          Modulation of skin aging through study modified exosomal contents on the IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways related to skin aging.
        
        
      
      In fact, our investigation involved treating HFFF2 cells with exosomes derived from both HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs, all of which had been pre‐treated with either Ole or Fe@C/Ole. This approach led to an observable increase in the expression of several key genes: IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF (Figure 11). This outcome aligns generally with findings from direct Ole therapy, with the notable exception of the EGF gene's response in hUC‐MSCs. Interestingly, whereas direct treatment of HFFF2 cells with Fe@C/Ole did not significantly alter the expression of IGF1 and COL1A1 and similarly for EGF and IGF1 in hUC‐MSCs, a significant upregulation was observed when these cells were instead treated with exosomes originating from HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs that had undergone Fe@C/Ole pre‐treatment. This suggests that the reduced toxicity of Fe@C/Ole when delivered via exosomes appears to have notably increased gene expression within the exosomes themselves, a significant improvement compared to direct application. Utilizing modified exosomal content offers distinct benefits over conventional treatments. Primarily, these modified exosomes do not trigger the body's antibody and antigen systems, thus avoiding an immune response. Secondly, their internal components are directly influenced by the initial treatment, as these exosomes are typically derived from living cells [22, 62]. Furthermore, both Ole therapy and Fe@C/Ole application substantially altered the makeup of the exosomes, leading to observable changes in their modified content. Exosomes also exhibit remarkable anti‐inflammatory properties, which contribute to accelerated healing, a reduced risk of EGF complications such as post‐inflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring, and improved results in photo rejuvenation by enhancing collagenases and promoting the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts [63, 64].
      On the other hand, this investigation focused on microRNAs linked to genes involved in the IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways. We assessed how Ole and Fe@C/Ole treatments affected the levels of exosomal microRNAs in HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs, given their known association with growth factors and genes critical for skin rejuvenation. The findings indicated that a 24‐h treatment influenced the expression levels of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs in exosomes. The changes in Ole and Fe@C/Ole treatments resulted in the downregulation of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs in exosomes derived from HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs. Downregulation of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs as interfering RNAs justified the upregulation of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF gene expression (Table 2). These observations were corroborated by the expression of the aforementioned genes within HFFF2 cells, subsequent to their treatment with HFFF2‐derived exosomes that had undergone pre‐treatment with Ole and Fe@C/Ole (Figure 6). This research demonstrates a clear alignment between the microRNA levels found within the exosomes and those present in the HFFF2 recipient cells influenced by these exosomes. Consequently, modified exosomal content, produced through Ole and Fe@C/Ole therapy, emerges as a practical substitute for directly treating cells. These tiny vesicles hold considerable benefits when compared to traditional topical facial applications, positioning them as a more effective therapeutic choice [65, 66].
      Unexpectedly, overexpression of hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p in exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole and also exosomes of HFFF2 cells that were treated with exosomes derived from these cells indicates a complex role in skin aging responses. It enhances skin repair by promoting cell turnover and healthier epidermal layers, regulates oncogene‐suppressing pathways to prevent skin deterioration, and induces apoptosis to clear damaged cells, supporting new cell generation. Additionally, it modulates genes vital for tissue repair, boosting collagen and elastin synthesis for improved skin youthfulness. These effects collectively enhance skin self‐renewal, underscoring its potential in antiaging research [67, 68, 69, 70].
      This study provides novel insights into the regenerative properties of modified exosomal contents, indicating that Ole and Fe@C/Ole in exosome‐based therapies hold great promise for skin rejuvenation. In addition, this study offers important insights into the effects of Ole and Fe@C/Ole on cellular mechanisms, and it is important to understand that the experiments were performed in vitro using cell lines. Applying these findings to in vivo conditions, such as human skin, could require more studies. The intricacies of the human body, including factors such as skin thickness and blood circulation, may affect the efficacy and potential side effects of Ole or Fe@C/Ole‐based treatments.

      Conclusion
      The research findings indicate that the use of modified exosomal content with Ole and Fe@C/Ole (slow release) treatment is a more effective method for transferring substances and biomolecules that are effective in the molecular mechanisms of skin rejuvenation than the use of effective substance treatment alone in vitro. This method can ultimately increase collagen and elastin gene expression while reducing interfering microRNAs in their respective genes.

Title: Long-term Safety and Effectiveness of Cold-Crosslinked Hyaluronic Acid Fillers: Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Double-Blind Study

Abstract: AbstractBackgroundEvolysse Form (EVLF) and Evolysse Smooth (EVLS) (Symatese, Chaponost, France) are new hyaluronic acid fillers created using an innovative cold-crosslinking process.ObjectivesThe authors of this study aim to collect safety and effectiveness data on new cold-crosslinked fillers to support the US approval for the correction of moderate-to-severe dynamic facial wrinkles and folds.MethodsIn this randomized, controlled, split-face study, 140 patients with moderate-to-severe nasolabial folds (NLFs) received a cold-crosslinked filler in 1 NLF (EVLF = 70, EVLS = 70) and a traditionally crosslinked filler, Restylane-L (RESL), in the contralateral fold and were followed through 12 months with an optional retreatment at that time point and subsequent 3 months of safety follow-up.ResultsThe primary endpoint of mean Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale change from baseline to Month 6 as rated by the photographic review panel demonstrated noninferiority and statistical superiority for the cold-crosslinked fillers. Blinded evaluator Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale assessments showed a mean change from baseline that was statistically significantly better than RESL for EVLF at all visits through 12 months and for EVLS at 6 and 9 months. Most patients were responders on the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale throughout the study, according to ratings by blinded evaluators, treating investigators, and patients. The FACE-Q appraisal of NLFs’ overall mean score showed significant improvement from baseline (P < .0001) at all time points through Month 12 for all treatment groups. All treatments were well tolerated.ConclusionsThe new cold-crosslinked fillers were shown to be safe and effective for correction of NLFs, with results lasting for 1 year.Level of Evidence: 1 (Therapeutic)

Body: Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are widely used in aesthetic treatments because of their biocompatibility. Crosslinking of the HA molecules is a necessary step to create fillers with appropriate mechanical properties and duration in the skin, and the BDDE (1,4-Butanediol diglycidyl ether) crosslinker enables the HA molecules to resist enzymatic and oxidative degradation. The crosslinking step in manufacturing fillers is traditionally done at an elevated pH and in a heated state, and the highly alkaline conditions activate the BDDE epoxide rings, which leads to the crosslinking of the HA by forming covalent bonds. However, in this caustic environment, HA fragmentation can occur, further exacerbated by thermal energy (eg, heat) of the reaction conditions.1,2 Evolysse Form (EVLF) and Evolysse Smooth (EVLS) (Symatese, Chaponost, France) are new HA fillers created using an innovative cold-crosslinking process (Cold-X Technology). Performing the crosslinking process in a cold state helps to better preserve the long HA chains and requires less BDDE to achieve the targeted rheological properties. Less fragmentation of the HA chains aims to improve safety as well as the performance and duration of the fillers.
    The purpose of this pivotal study was to collect safety and effectiveness data on the new cold-crosslinked injectable HA gels, EVLF and EVLS, which supported approval by the US FDA for the correction of moderate-to-severe dynamic facial wrinkles and folds.
    
      METHODS
      
        Study Design
        This randomized, controlled, split-face study was conducted at 6 sites in the United States, with patients and evaluators being blinded to which HA filler was injected in each nasolabial fold (NLF), and investigators who performed the treatments being unblinded. Patients were randomized using an electronic data capture system in a 1:1:2 ratio to receive one of the EVL fillers in 1 NLF and Restylane-L (RESL; Q-Med AB, Sweden) in the other (side of the face for each treatment was randomized), and randomization was stratified by Fitzpatrick skin type (I-III and IV-VI) and investigational site to ensure balance between treatment arms. Follow-up visits occurred 2 and 6 weeks after initial treatment as well as at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients electing to receive retreatment at 12 months were followed at 2 weeks and 3 months after that for safety only.
        The study was reviewed and approved by WCG IRB and was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT0532541; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05325411?term=NCT05325411&rank=1). Written consent was provided, by which the patients agreed to the use and analysis of their data. All study visits occurred between May 2022 and March 2024.
      
      
        Patients
        Patients were required to be aged 22 and older and have moderate or severe NLFs on the Wrinkle Severity Rating Scale (WSRS) as scored live by a blinded evaluator. Washout periods were 2 weeks for topical treatments (prescription wrinkle treatments, steroids, and self-tanners), 3 months for noninvasive skin-tightening treatments, 6 months for ablative or nonablative dermal resurfacing procedures, and 12 months for neurotoxin injections below the orbital rim and nonpermanent facial fillers. Patients with any history of permanent facial fillers were excluded.
      
      
        Treatment
        Patients received a cold-crosslinked filler (EVLF or EVLS) in 1 NLF and a traditionally crosslinked filler (RESL) approved for NLF treatment in the contralateral NLF. HA concentration was 22 mg/mL for EVLF and 20 mg/mL for EVLS and RESL, and all 3 fillers were crosslinked with BDDE and contained 0.3% lidocaine to minimize injection pain. Initial treatment and optional touch-up 2 weeks later were with the randomized fillers in each respective NLF, and optional retreatment at 12 months plus accompanying optional touch-up were with the EVL fillers in both NLFs as needed. Treatments were performed according to each product's instructions for use, which included linear threading (antegrade and retrograde), crosshatching, and serial puncture as options for injection techniques. Injection volume was determined by the treating investigators.
      
      
        Assessments
        The validated 5-point photonumeric WSRS was used by blinded evaluators at screening and all follow-up visits from 6 weeks through 12 months to rate NLFs as absent, mild, moderate, severe, or extreme.3 An independent photographic review panel of 3 physicians performed assessments with the same scale using photographs from screening and Month 6 visits.
        Blinded evaluators, treating investigators, and patients all performed assessments on the 5-point Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS: very much improved, much improved, improved, no change, and worse) by comparing screening photographs to live appearance at all follow-up visits from 6 weeks through 12 months. Patients completed the validated FACE-Q appraisal of NLF questionnaire at screening and all follow-up visits from 6 weeks through 12 months to rate how bothered they were by various aspects of their NLFs on a 4-point scale (not at all, a little, moderately, and extremely).4 At the same time points, patients used screening photographs for comparison and completed the Aesthetic Appearance Questionnaire to rate treatment outcomes on 4-point satisfaction scales (very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, and very dissatisfied) or 5-point agreement scales (strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, and strongly disagree). Immediately after each study treatment and at 10, 20, and 30 min, patients rated pain in each NLF in half-point increments on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. For all effectiveness assessments, each NLF was rated individually.
        For 30 days after each study treatment, patients completed daily diaries to rate the intensity of common treatment responses as mild, moderate, or severe. At all study visits, adverse events (AEs) were collected, and Snellen eye examinations and ocular movement assessments were performed (at least 30 min after study injections at treatment visits).
      
      
        Statistics
        The primary endpoint was the mean WSRS change from baseline to Month 6 as rated by the photographic review panel for the modified intent-to-treat population and analyzed with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Secondary endpoints were evaluated for the modified intent-to-treat population and included WSRS responder rates (NLFs with at least 1-grade improvement), according to photographic review panel and blinded evaluators (95% CIs); WSRS mean change (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and superiority or equivalence as assessed by blinded evaluators; GAIS improvement as assessed by blinded evaluators, treating investigators, and patients (95% CIs); FACE-Q appraisal of NLF improvement vs baseline (paired t test); and pain scale (95% CIs). An additional endpoint was the Aesthetic Appearance Questionnaire (95% CIs). Analyses of WSRS mean change and responder rate at Month 6 were performed with 95% CIs for the subgroups of sex, race, ethnicity, age group, Fitzpatrick skin type, injection volume, baseline WSRS score, and touch-up status.
        Common treatment responses and AEs were coded to MedDRA terms and summarized with descriptive statistics. Subgroup analyses of common treatment responses and AEs were performed by sex, race, ethnicity, age group, Fitzpatrick skin type, injection volume, baseline WSRS score, touch-up status, and needle size.
        Sample size was calculated using statistical software PASS version 16.0.4 and determined that a minimum of 25 patients were needed in each study arm to achieve at least 95% power with a noninferiority margin of 0.5 points for the primary endpoint. However, the study sought to enroll 70 patients in each arm to collect adequate safety data and account for potential attrition.

        Patient and Treatment Characteristics
        A total of 141 patients were randomized, with 1 patient in the EVLF arm discontinuing before treatment, resulting in 70 treated patients in each study arm (Table 1). The majority of treated patients finished follow-up through the entirety of the study, with 87.1% (61/70) in the EVLF arm and 92.9% (65/70) in the EVLS arm completing the study. Most patients were female and white, and all Fitzpatrick skin types were represented. All patients had each NLF rated as moderate or severe on the WSRS as required in the study eligibility criteria.

        Of the 70 patients in the EVLF arm, 51 received touch-up with EVLF and 52 with RESL, with a mean volume injected for initial and touch-up treatments combined of 1.2 mL for EVLF (range, 0.2-3.0 mL) and 1.3 mL for RESL (range, 0.5-3.2 mL). Retreatment was performed for 44 of the EVLF NLFs and 47 of the control NLFs, with a mean total EVLF volume injected for retreatment and retreatment touch-up treatments combined of 0.8 mL for each NLF (range, 0.02-1.9 mL).
        Of the 70 patients in the EVLS arm, 54 received touch-up in each NLF, with a mean volume injected for initial and touch-up treatments combined of 1.0 mL for EVLS (range, 0.4-1.9 mL) and 1.2 mL for RESL (range, 0.5-3.0 mL). Retreatment was performed for 44 NLFs on each side, with a mean total EVLS volume injected for retreatment and retreatment touch-up treatments combined of 0.6 mL for each NLF (range, 0.05-1.4 mL).
        The needle size was 27 G (54.3%) or 30 G (45.7%) for EVLF injections, 30 G for EVLS injections, and 29 G for all control injections. The most common injection techniques for all NLFs were retrograde linear threading (82.9%-85.7%) and crosshatching (38.6%-40.0%).
      
      
        Effectiveness
        For the EVLF primary endpoint (n = 62), the absolute difference in the mean WSRS change from baseline to Month 6 for EVLF vs RESL was −0.27 (95% CI, −0.500 to −0.032), favoring EVLF, and the upper bound of the 95% CI was <0.5 threshold, so noninferiority was concluded (Figure 1), and statistical superiority was supported by the CIs not crossing zero and a corresponding P-value of <.001.

        Similarly, for the EVLS primary endpoint (n = 62), the absolute difference in the mean WSRS change from baseline to Month 6 for EVLS vs RESL was −0.22 (95% CI, −0.416 to −0.019), favoring EVLS, and the upper bound of the 95% CI was <0.5 threshold, so noninferiority was concluded (Figure 2), and statistical superiority was supported by the CIs not crossing zero and a corresponding P-value of <.001.

        Blinded evaluator live assessments of WSRS showed a mean change from baseline that was significantly better for EVLF than RESL at all visits through 12 months (Figure 3) and the vast majority of EVLF NLFs remained responders throughout the study (Figure 4). EVLS was significantly better than RESL at 6 and 9 months (Figure 5) and the vast majority of EVLS NLFs remained responders throughout the study (Figure 6). Example photographs of the lasting correction are provided in Figure 7 for an EVLF patient and Figure 8 for EVLS patient. Month 6 WSRS responder rates per the photographic review panel were 45.2% for EVLF and 38.7% for RESL and 51.6% for EVLS and 35.5% for RESL. At all time points, blinded evaluators most commonly rated both NLFs as equivalent on the WSRS, with superior ratings more common for the EVL NLFs. For example, at Month 6 in the EVLF arm, 49.2% were equivalent, 38.1% EVLF superior, and 12.7% RESL superior; in the EVLS arm, 69.4% were equivalent, 25.8% EVLS superior, and 4.8% RESL superior.

        Most patients were responders on the GAIS throughout the study, according to ratings by blinded evaluators (6 weeks: EVLF 96.9%, RESL 100%; EVLS 97.0%, RESL 97.0%; 12 months: EVLF 73.8%, RESL 60.7%; EVLS 66.2%, RESL 66.2%), treating investigators (6 weeks: EVLF 96.9%, RESL 98.5%; EVLS 100%, RESL 100%; 12 months: EVLF 77.0%, RESL 65.6%; EVLS 73.8%, RESL 66.2%), and patients (6 weeks: EVLF 95.4%, RESL 93.8%; EVLS 98.5%, RESL 98.5%; 12 months: EVLF 80.3%, RESL 72.1%; EVLS 92.3%, RESL 86.2%).
        The FACE-Q appraisal of NLFs’ overall mean score showed significant improvement from baseline (P < .0001) at all time points through Month 12 for all treatment groups. Before treatment, 88.6% of patients were extremely or moderately bothered by the depth of their EVLF NLFs, which improved to 31.7% at Month 6; for EVLS NLFs, it was 82.9% improving to 24.2%.
        On the 0 to 10 pain scale, mean injection pain for these fillers with lidocaine was 2.7 to 3.0 across the treatment groups, with all reducing to 0.2 at 30 min after injection.
        Assessments of these new fillers on the Aesthetic Appearance Questionnaire showed that at Month 6 for the EVLF NLFs 79.4% of patients reported that their NLF looked better overall, 84.1% that the results looked natural, 82.5% that the results felt natural, 84.1% that they would receive the treatment again, and 82.5% that they would recommend the treatment to friends. Likewise, for the EVLS NLFs 83.6% of patients reported that their NLF looked better overall, 86.9% that the results looked natural, 88.5% that the results felt natural, 90.2% that they would receive the treatment again, and 87.1% that they would recommend the treatment to friends.
        Subgroup analyses demonstrated that EVLF and EVLS are effective for moderate and severe NLFs in both men and women and all races, ethnicities, Fitzpatrick skin phototypes, and age groups, with or without touch-up treatment.
      
      
        Safety
        The most common treatment responses after initial treatment for all treatment groups were injection-site swelling and tenderness (Tables 2, 3). These were also the most common responses after retreatment though the rates were lower (swelling 52.2%-54.5% with EVLF, 44.2%-46.5% with EVLS; tenderness 45.7%-52.3% with EVLF, 41.9%-44.2% with EVLS). Most treatment responses were mild or moderate severity and resolved within 1 week for all NLFs after initial treatment and retreatment.

        In the EVLF arm, there were treatment-related AEs in 11 EVLF NLFs (15.7%) and 8 RESL NLFs (11.4%) after initial treatment, most commonly injection-site mass (8.6% for EVLF, 2.9% for RESL), with pain, swelling, pruritus, discomfort, discoloration, bruising, inflammation, nodule, jaw pain, and foreign body sensation occurring in 1 or 2 patients each. After retreatment, 1 patient had injection-site pain in each NLF, and 1 had a headache. All treatment-related AEs were mild severity except for 1 moderate severity jaw pain for RESL, and all resolved. There were 2 delayed-onset AEs that occurred in RESL NLFs 6 months after touch-up treatment, and both of these required treatment. One patient received oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids for injection-site inflammation, and 1 patient received oral antibiotics for injection-site nodule; both resolved within 3 weeks after treatment.
        In the EVLS arm, there were treatment-related AEs in 5 EVLS NLFs (7.1%) and 6 RESL NLFs (8.6%) after initial treatment, most commonly injection-site discoloration (4.3%), injection-site mass (2.9% for EVLS, 4.3% for RESL), and injection-site erythema (2.9%) in both NLFs, with pain, swelling, pruritus, bruising, flushing, and papule occurring in just a single patient each. After retreatment there was 1 bilateral injection-site bruising and 1 each unilateral injection-site mass, injection-site pain, and injection-site swelling. All treatment-related AEs were mild or moderate severity and resolved.
        There were no treatment-related serious AEs and no changes in extraocular motility or confrontation visual fields throughout the study. There was 1 patient with a transient decrease in visual acuity from 20/25 at screening to 20/30 at Week 6 and a return to 20/25 at Month 3 and all subsequent time points.
        Because of the small sample size, safety data are limited for Fitzpatrick skin Types V and VI for EVLF. However, subgroup analyses supported safety across subgroups by sex, race, ethnicity, age group, Fitzpatrick skin type, injection volume, baseline WSRS score, touch-up status, and needle size.
      
    
    
      DISCUSSION
      With the results of this study, the authors showed that the new cold-crosslinked fillers are safe and effective for correction of NLFs. The primary endpoints were met, demonstrating that EVLF and EVLS were both noninferior to RESL and further that they were statistically superior according to evaluations by an independent photographic review panel. Blinded evaluator live WSRS ratings showed that the vast majority of EVLF and EVLS NLFs remained responders throughout the 12-month follow-up period, with mean change from baseline that was significantly better than RESL at all visits through 12 months for EVLF (despite similar injection volumes: mean 1.2 mL for EVLF and 1.3 mL for RESL) and at 6 and 9 months for EVLS (despite lower injection volume mean of 1.0 mL for EVLS and 1.2 mL for RESL). Safety assessments showed that all of the fillers were safe and tolerable, with expected treatment responses and AEs for filler injections. As anticipated for fillers containing lidocaine, procedural pain was minimal for the new fillers and the control filler.
      The blinded evaluator live WSRS responder rates were substantially higher than those from the independent photographic review panel, but this finding is consistent with other filler studies. A study of Juvéderm Voluma XC (Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie company, Irvine, CA) had Month 6 responder rates on the validated Allergan Chin Retrusion Scale of 91.8% for live assessments vs 56.3% for photographic assessments.5 Similarly, a study of RESL and Juvéderm Volbella XC (Allergan Aesthetics, an AbbVie company) had Month 3 responder rates on the validated Allergan Lip Fullness Scale of 81.4% and 84.2%, respectively, for live assessments vs 29.3% and 34.1%, respectively, for photographic assessments. This is not unexpected given that photographic images provide less detail than live evaluations.6
      In an earlier randomized, controlled split-face European study,7 45 patients were treated with EVLF and RESL in their NLFs, and the primary endpoint of mean WSRS change at 1 month by blinded evaluator demonstrated noninferiority of EVLF as well as statistical superiority (P < .001). Furthermore, secondary endpoints showed significantly better mean WSRS scores for EVLF than RESL at 3 months (P = .018) and 6 months (P = .037). Objective measurements of wrinkle volume with the fringe projection system DermaTOP (Eotech, France) showed that despite the same mean injection volume for both products, the NLF volume was significantly better for EVLF at 6 months (P = .038). On the GAIS, patient ratings showed similar results for both products, whereas blinded evaluator ratings showed significantly better results for EVLF at 3 and 6 months. Both products resulted in mild-to-moderate transient injection-site responses and AEs.
      EVLS was evaluated in a previous prospective, multicenter, open-label study8 in which 72 patients received a single treatment with another cold-crosslinked HA filler (ESTYME LIPS, Symatese, France) in their lips, and 61 patients also received EVLS in their NLFs and lip fine lines. On 6-point validated scales, mean NLF improvement ranged from 1.3 points at 30 days to 0.7 points at 12 months, and mean lip fine lines improvement ranged from 1.6 points at 30 days to 1 point at 12 months. A majority of patients were responders at all time points through 12 months on the validated scales as well as investigator and patient ratings on the GAIS. Injection-site responses and AEs were primarily of mild severity.
      Limitations of this study include a comparison with only a single HA injectable control, recognizing that this is standard for FDA registration studies, and time to complete loss of correction was not established as the majority of EVLF and EVLS NLFs continued to show improvement at the end of the study.
    
    
      CONCLUSIONS
      The new cold-crosslinked fillers were shown to be safe and effective for correction of NLFs, with results lasting for 1 year.

Title: Multiomics analysis revealed the regulatory role of chenodeoxycholic acid in fatty acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis

Abstract: ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the regulatory role and mechanisms of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on lipid metabolism, and to evaluate its therapeutic potential in lipid metabolism-related diseases such as acne, seborrheic alopecia, and prostate cancer, with the aim of identifying safer and more sustainable treatment alternatives.MethodsLipid-overproduction models were established using RM-1 (murine prostate cancer cells) and primary sebaceous gland cells, stimulated by linoleic acid (LA) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), respectively. CDCA’s mechanisms were explored using transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics. In vivo validation was conducted via intradermal injection of CDCA into the sebaceous gland area of golden hamsters to assess its effect on sebaceous lipid metabolism.ResultsCDCA significantly reduced intracellular lipid accumulation in both murine prostate cancer cells (RM-1) and primary sebaceous gland cells, and suppressed the expression of the androgen receptor (AR), along with the downregulation of key lipogenic enzymes (SREBF1, FASN, FADS2). Mitochondrial membrane potential was restored in CDCA-treated cells. Multi-omics analyses revealed that CDCA modulated fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation, energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPAR-γ) signaling. Lipidomic profiling demonstrated a shift from saturated to unsaturated fatty acid dominance after CDCA treatment. In vivo, CDCA decreased sebaceous lipid accumulation and downregulated PPAR-γ expression in golden hamsters.ConclusionCDCA exerted multifaceted regulatory effects on lipid metabolism, hormone signaling, and mitochondrial dynamics. These effects contributed to the maintenance of sebaceous gland homeostasis and supported the development of innovative and potentially more biocompatible therapies for lipid-related disorders.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02656-w.

Body: Introduction
      Lipid homeostasis refers to the state in which organisms maintain the balance of lipid levels, encompassing multiple aspects such as fatty acid metabolism. As fundamental units of lipid metabolism, fatty acids play pivotal roles in critical physiological processes including energy supply, cellular membrane structure, and signal transduction [1–3]. However, dysregulation of lipid metabolism is closely associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases, particularly in cancer and dermatological disorders. For instance, in prostate cancer, aberrant lipid metabolism not only contributes to tumorigenesis but also correlates with malignant progression and therapeutic resistance [4–6]. In dermatology, disrupted lipid metabolism is implicated in acne and seborrheic alopecia. Excessive lipid accumulation drives acne pathogenesis, while abnormal lipid metabolism may alter the follicular microenvironment in seborrheic alopecia [7, 8]. Thus, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of lipid homeostasis is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and developing novel therapeutic strategies.
      Bear bile, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely utilized for its heat-clearing, detoxifying, liver-soothing, and vision-improving properties. Ancient texts such as the Xiao’ er Weisheng Zongwei Lun Fang (Compendium of Pediatric Health and Refined Prescriptions) documented the use of “Xiongdan Shexiang Wan” (Bear Bile and Musk Pill) to treat pediatric malnutrition syndromes, stating: “For treating pediatric malnutrition syndromes, abdominal distension, pica, and persistent fever” [9]. The term “malnutrition syndromes” in modern contexts may correlate with metabolic disorders, including malnutrition and digestive dysfunction, both linked to lipid metabolism. Studies indicate that bear bile powder improves lipid profiles by reducing total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) while elevating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels [10–12]. Furthermore, clinical research demonstrates that bear bile-containing formulations and bear bile powder itself exhibit efficacy in managing lipid metabolism disorders such as hyperlipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [13, 14]. These findings highlight bear bile’s potential in modulating fatty acid metabolism and maintaining lipid homeostasis.
      Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), the primary bioactive components of bear bile powder [15–17], have shown therapeutic promise in metabolic disorders. Both bile acids improve hepatic function, regulate cholesterol metabolism, and mitigate inflammation, with established clinical applications in NAFLD and primary biliary cholangitis [18–20].
      However, despite this growing recognition, the potential of CDCA in regulating fatty acid metabolism outside hepatic contexts—particularly in tumor biology and dermatological lipid disorders—remains largely unexplored.
      In particular, the roles of CDCA in sebaceous lipid metabolism and its molecular targets in prostate cancer and sebaceous glands have not been systematically elucidated.
      Addressing this gap may offer new insights into the extrahepatic functions of bile acids and contribute to the development of novel metabolic therapies for skin and cancer-related disorders.
      Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of CDCA in modulating fatty acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis in both prostate cancer and sebaceous gland models. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics, the study sought to elucidate the molecular pathways involved and identify potential therapeutic targets of CDCA in the context of cancer and dermatological lipid disorders.

        Cell culture of RM-1 and primary sebaceous gland cells
        RM-1 cells (CL-0198, Procell Life Science & Technology, Wuhan, China) and primary sebaceous gland cells (CTCC-280-HUM, Meisen Cell Technology, Hangzhou, China) were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37℃ with 5% CO2. Humidity was maintained by placing 3000 mL of sterile distilled water in the incubator to prevent medium evaporation. RM-1 cells were cultured in DMEM medium (SH30022.01, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (PSA). Primary sebaceous gland cells were maintained in specialized epithelial cell medium (CTCC-009-613, Meisen Cell Technology, Hangzhou, China), composed of basal medium, 10% FBS, 1% epithelial cell growth supplement (ECGS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells within passages 4–8 were used for experiments. Routine subculturing was performed when cells reached 80% confluency.
        STR profiling confirmed that the sebaceous gland cells were of human origin, consistent with the supplier’s documentation. In addition, immunostaining for keratin 7 (KRT7)—a cytoskeletal protein expressed in epithelial lineages including sebaceous cells—was used to further support their identity (Supplementary Material 3). All STR authentication results are provided in Supplementary Materials 1–3.
      
      
        CCK-8 assay
        RM-1 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in culture medium. Cell suspensions (8,000 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ until adherent. Cholic acid (CA, 81-25-4, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), deoxycholic acid (DCA, 83-44-3, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), UDCA (128-13-2, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and CDCA(474-25-9, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were diluted in serum-free medium to concentrations of 0–500 µmol/L. After 24 h of treatment, 10 µL of CCK-8 solution (CK04, Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) and 90 µL of serum-free medium were added to each well. Plates were gently shaken to ensure uniform distribution and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Cell proliferation rates were calculated as:
        Cell viability (%) = [(Experimental group– Blank control) / (Negative control– Blank control)] × 100.
      
      
        Nile red staining for lipid detection
        RM-1 and primary sebaceous gland cells in the logarithmic phase were seeded into 96-well plates (8,000 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. Groups included: normal control, LA-treated (0.1 mmol/L for RM-1; 0.0125 mmol/L for primary sebaceous gland cells), and LA combined with CA/DCA/UDCA/CDCA. After 24 h of treatment, cells were exposed to 20 µg/mL dihydrotestosterone (DHT, D413176, Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) for 48 h. Medium was discarded, and cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min each). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (50 µL/well, 20 min), washed with PBS, stained with Nile Red (7385-67-3, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) (50 µL/well, 20 min, dark), and washed again. Triton X-100 (0.5%, 50 µL/well, 5 min) and DAPI (5 min) were sequentially applied. Fluorescence was visualized using an inverted microscope (CKX41, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
      
      
        Mitochondrial membrane potential assay
        Cells were treated for 24 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with 1 mL mitochondrial membrane potential probe (JC-10) staining working solution (CA1310, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) at 37 °C for 20 min. JC-10 staining buffer (1×) was prepared by diluting 5× stock with distilled water (1:4) and stored on ice. After incubation, cells were washed twice with 1× buffer and observed under a fluorescence microscope.
      
      
        qPCR analysis of lipid metabolism genes in RM-1
        Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (15596018, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), reverse-transcribed with ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix (FSQ-201, TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), and quantified. qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Premix (PK-201, TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) in 20 µL reactions (95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles). GAPDH served as the reference gene. Relative mRNA levels were calculated via the 2^−ΔΔCt method. The PCR primer (Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Material 4.
      
      
        Western blot analysis
        After 24 h of treatment, cells were harvested for protein extraction. Protein lysates were normalized based on concentration, mixed with loading buffer, and denatured at 100 °C for 10 min. Approximately 20–40 µg of protein (in a volume of 5–15 µL) per lane was separated by SDS-PAGE at 200 V. After the bromophenol blue front reached the gel bottom, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against fatty acid synthase (FASN), sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), and Histone 3 (all diluted 1:1000). Notably, the anti-FASN (A19050), anti-FADS2 (A24354), and anti-Histone 3 (A4835) antibodies were obtained from Abclonal Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China), while the anti-SREBF1 antibody (14088-1-AP) was purchased from Proteintech (Rosemont, IL, USA). The next day, membranes were washed thrice with TBST (10 min each) and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by further TBST washes. Signal detection was performed using ECL reagents and visualized on a ChemiDoc imaging system (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA).
      
      
        Multi-Omics profiling
        
          RNA-Seq
          Cell samples from RM-1 were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground, and lysed in 1 mL of pre-chilled Trizol. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Next, 200 µL of pre-chilled chloroform was added, mixed vigorously, and allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature. Following another centrifugation, the aqueous phase was collected, mixed with an equal volume of pre-chilled isopropanol, and incubated for 10 min. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed with 1 mL of 75% ethanol, briefly air-dried (3–5 min), and resuspended in 20–50 µL of 0.1% DEPC-treated water. The total RNA was then used for mRNA enrichment, fragmentation, cDNA synthesis, adapter ligation, and subsequent sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq Xplus platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data analysis—including read alignment, expression quantification, differential expression analysis, and KEGG enrichment using the Python SciPy package—was performed. Please refer to Supplementary Material 5 for details.
        
        
          Fatty acid metabolomics
          primary sebaceous gland cells samples (300 µL per sample, diluted 2×) were stored at − 80 °C. A mixed standard solution of 50 common fatty acids was prepared at 2000 µg/mL and further diluted using a 50% acetonitrile–isopropanol solution. Isotopically labeled internal standards were also prepared. Fatty acids were extracted using acetonitrile and isopropanol to ensure efficient recovery. Quantification was performed using UHPLC-MS/MS (AB SCIEX ExionLC™ AD system coupled with a QTRAP® 6500 + mass spectrometer) in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Standard curves generated from known concentrations were used to determine sample concentrations, with statistical analyses performed using Microsoft Excel and appropriate statistical software.
        
        
          Deep data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics
          Proteins from primary sebaceous gland cell samples were extracted and analyzed using an Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer in a DIA workflow. This method enables simultaneous collection of fragment data from all precursor ions, providing enhanced coverage and reproducibility compared to data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Quantitative analysis was conducted using DIA-NN software with retention time calibration via internal peptide standards. Differentially expressed proteins were defined as those with expression changes greater than 1.2-fold or less than 0.83-fold and a P-value < 0.05. Functional annotation and enrichment analyses were carried out using the COG, GO, and KEGG databases, and protein–protein interaction networks were constructed to elucidate biological functions.
        
      
      
        Golden hamster model
        Three SPF-grade golden hamsters (average weight ~ 120 g, 8 weeks old) were procured from Beijing Weitong Lihua Experimental Animal Technology Co., Ltd. and housed in the Animal Experimental Facility of the Institute of Basic Theory, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (License No. SCXX (Beijing) 2021-0006). The animals were maintained under controlled environmental conditions (temperature 20–24 °C, humidity 40–60%, 12-hour light/dark cycle, with adequate ventilation, standardized feed, and ad libitum water). The hair on the sebaceous gland regions of both sides of the abdomen was removed prior to experimentation. The experimental group received subcutaneous injections of a CDCA injection solution in the right-side sebaceous gland region, prepared per 2 mL as follows: 2 mg CDCA, 18 mg benzyl alcohol, 2.84 mg disodium hydrogen phosphate, 8.76 mg sodium chloride, 2.86 mg sodium hydroxide, and injection water, with pH adjusted to 8.3 as needed using hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. The control group was administered an equivalent volume of blank control solution. Injections were given daily for six consecutive days, and data were recorded at various time points.
      
      
        Dermatoscopic data acquisition
        Following induction of anesthesia with isoflurane, the dorsal hair of the golden hamsters was removed using depilatory cream and thoroughly washed with physiological saline. Once the skin was dry, a medical electronic dermatoscope (CH-DSIS-2000, Chuanghong Medical Technology, China) equipped with a 20× lens was placed in close contact with the skin. The focus was adjusted until a clear image of the sebaceous gland region was obtained, and parameters such as gland size and pigment deposition were recorded.
      
      
        Oil red O staining
        Frozen Sect. (10 μm thick) of the sebaceous gland region were prepared and fixed in 10% formalin for 30 min. Sections were then rinsed twice with distilled water (3 min each), treated with 60% isopropanol for 20–30 s, and stained with an improved Oil Red O staining kit (G1261, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) for 10–15 min. After brief differentiation with 60% isopropanol (5–10 s) and a distilled water rinse (1 min), Mayer’s hematoxylin was applied for 1–2 min. The sections were then washed, air-dried, and mounted with glycerol gelatin. Lipid droplets appeared in shades of orange-red, while nuclei were stained blue.
      
      
        Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining
        Paraffin Sect. (4 μm thick) were deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to staining with an HE staining kit (G1120, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China). Sections were stained with hematoxylin for 2 min, rinsed under running water for 10 min to achieve “blueing,” briefly differentiated with an acidic solution for 10 s, and subsequently stained with eosin for 20 s. After thorough rinsing, the slides were dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and mounted with neutral gum for optical microscopy image acquisition.
      
      
        Immunofluorescence staining
        Frozen Sect. (10 μm thick) from the sebaceous gland region were equilibrated to room temperature and washed three times with PBS (3 min per wash). After blocking with 5% goat serum at room temperature for 1 h to prevent nonspecific binding, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against Ki67 (dilution 1:200) and Cytokeratin 5 (K5, dilution 1:200) (27309-1-AP and 66727-1-Ig, respectively, from Proteintech, Wuhan, China). The following day, sections were washed three times with PBS, incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody (1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h, and finally mounted with DAPI-containing fluorescence mounting medium. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence imaging was performed using a touchscreen microscope (RVL2-K2, Echo Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA) with high-resolution objectives (4x–100x oil) and multi-wavelength LED excitation. Standard fluorophore filter sets (e.g., DAPI, FITC, TRITC, Cy5) were used, and images were captured with a 5 MP CMOS camera (2448 × 2048 pixels). Acquisition and processing were controlled via Revolve software, enabling automated exposure, focus, and filter selection.Image analysis was performed on three independent biological replicates. For each replicate, four images were captured under consistent exposure settings. Two images were averaged to generate one data point, resulting in six statistical values per group (n = 6). This design ensures both data representativeness and statistical reliability.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        All images were analyzed using ImageJ software (Version 1.8.0, NIH) with standardized protocols. Immunofluorescence intensity was quantified by threshold-based methods (auto-threshold algorithm combined with negative control calibration) to calculate integrated density. Oil Red O staining was processed via RGB color thresholding (Hue 0–30, Saturation 50–255) to determine lipid droplet-positive area percentage (%Area). Prior to analysis, uniform background subtraction and region of interest (ROI) delineation were performed.
        Data were statistically evaluated using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Initial tests for normality (Shapiro–Wilk) and homogeneity of variances (Levene’s test) were performed; if assumptions were violated, non-parametric tests or variance adjustments were applied. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni or Tukey post hoc tests for multiple comparisons. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

        Regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism in RM-1 cells
        
          Effects of different bile acids on RM‑1 cell viability and LA-induced lipid accumulation: CDCA’s potent inhibitory effect and concentration advantage
          To systematically evaluate the effects of bile acids on RM-1 cell viability, the concentration-gradient responses of CA, DCA, UDCA, and CDCA were analyzed using CCK-8 assays (Fig. 1A–D). The IC10, IC15, and IC20 concentrations were selected from SPSS-predicted inhibition ranges (IC10-IC25) to enable pharmacological comparisons under equivalent inhibition conditions while maintaining > 80% cell viability for physiologically relevant lipid metabolism studies. As shown in Fig. 1A-D, all bile acids exhibited clear concentration-dependent inhibitory effects, with CDCA demonstrating the strongest potency, as evidenced by its significantly lower IC10 concentration (0.05 µmol/L) compared to other compounds (P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Notably, statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed between high-concentration groups (IC20) and 0 µmol/L controls.

Nile Red staining of RM-1 cells co-treated with LA and each bile acid at IC₁₀, IC₁₅, and IC₂₀ concentrations for 24 h: CDCA (G), CA (H), DCA (I), and UDCA (J), nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), and lipids with Nile Red (red), scale bar = 50 μm; K. Quantification of Nile Red fluorescence intensity (n = 6). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001)

          To assess the combined effects of bile acids and linoleic acid (LA, 0.1 mmol/L), the ability of each bile acid to suppress LA-induced lipid accumulation at IC₁₀/IC₁₅/IC₂₀ concentrations was further assessed (Fig. 1E–K). Nile red staining revealed that CDCA and UDCA exhibited markedly stronger lipid-suppressive effects than CA and DCA. Strikingly, CDCA exhibited a 52-fold greater potency than UDCA, achieving comparable lipid suppression at a significantly lower IC₁₀ concentration (0.05 µmol/L vs. 2.6 µmol/L). Given its superior concentration-efficacy profile and robust lipid-modulatory capacity, CDCA was prioritized for subsequent mechanistic investigations.
        
        
          Multiple regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential, and androgen receptor (AR) expression in RM-1 cells
          As illustrated in Fig. 2, CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation induced by linoleic acid (LA, 0.1 mmol/L) in RM-1 cells (Figs. 2A–B). Quantitative analysis of Nile red fluorescence intensity revealed a marked reduction in lipid accumulation in the CDCA-treated group compared to the LA group. Magnified images further demonstrated that CDCA alleviated localized intracellular lipid droplet aggregation (Fig. 2C).

Nile Red staining of RM-1 cells co-treated with DHT and CDCA (IC10-IC20); M. Quantitative analysis of Nile Red fluorescence intensity (n = 6). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001)

          Given the close relationship between lipid synthesis and mitochondrial energy metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was assessed using JC-10 staining (Figs. 2D–E). LA stimulation significantly increased ΔΨm, indicated by enhanced red fluorescence and diminished green fluorescence, suggesting elevated energy metabolism. In contrast, CDCA treatment significantly reduced the elevated ΔΨm induced by LA, bringing it closer to baseline levels observed in untreated cells. Quantitative analysis of the JC-10 red-to-green fluorescence ratio confirmed that CDCA-treated cells exhibited significantly lower ΔΨm than LA-stimulated cells.
          Although CDCA simultaneously suppressed lipid accumulation and modulated ΔΨm, the causal relationship between these effects remains to be elucidated. LA-induced lipid synthesis may elevate energy demands, thereby augmenting ΔΨm. However, CDCA’s inhibitory effects extend beyond lipid synthesis suppression and may involve indirect mechanisms, such as modulating fatty acid metabolism or mitochondrial function, to influence ΔΨm. Thus, the interplay between reduced lipid synthesis and ΔΨm attenuation likely involves a complex regulatory network requiring further investigation.
          Furthermore, considering the close interplay between lipid metabolism and hormonal signaling in prostate cancer, AR overexpression in RM-1 cells was induced using DHT. After 48 h of DHT stimulation, both AR expression and lipid accumulation were significantly elevated (Figs. 2G–H). Additionally, CCK-8 proliferation assays demonstrated that DHT not only enhanced lipid accumulation but also increased cellular viability (Fig. 2F).
          Importantly, co-treatment with CDCA and DHT substantially reduced DHT-induced AR upregulation (Figs. 2I–K). These findings suggest that CDCA may regulate lipid synthesis and metabolism by modulating androgen signaling through AR suppression. This mechanistic insight underscores CDCA’s potential therapeutic value in lipid metabolism-related disorders, such as acne. Acne pathogenesis is closely linked to increased androgen levels and altered lipid metabolism. Elevated androgens, particularly DHT, stimulate sebaceous glands to produce excessive sebum, leading to clogged pores and promoting the growth of Cutibacterium acnes, a bacterium implicated in acne inflammation. Additionally, lipid metabolic dysfunction impairs the skin barrier and fosters an inflammatory environment conducive to acne development.
          Moreover, under 2-DHT treatment, lipid accumulation increased, while CDCA was able to suppress lipid accumulation concurrently with AR inhibition (Figs. 2L–M), further elucidating the positive correlation between AR and lipid metabolism.
          Figure 2.
        
        
          CDCA modulates lipid metabolism in RM-1 cells via regulation of fatty acid and energy metabolic pathways
          RNA sequencing analysis revealed that co-treatment with CDCA and LA significantly altered gene expression profiles in RM-1 cells (Fig. 3A). Compared to the LA-treated group, the CDCA + LA group exhibited 72 upregulated and 57 downregulated genes (Fig. 3C). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predominantly associated with lipid and fatty acid metabolism-related pathways (Fig. 3D). Notably, the enrichment of the fatty acid metabolism pathway underscores CDCA’s pivotal role in regulating fatty acid synthesis, degradation, and metabolic homeostasis. Additionally, the enrichment of TGF-β and FoxO signaling pathways suggests that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism through indirect mechanisms. The involvement of the GnRH signaling pathway further implies that CDCA could modulate fatty acid metabolism via endocrine regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, pathways related to energy metabolism, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, were enriched, suggesting a potential link between CDCA treatment and alterations in cellular energy homeostasis. Furthermore, the enrichment of pathways like amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism suggests potential interactions between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the regulation of fatty acids.

Western blot analysis showing the expression levels of lipid metabolism-related proteins (FASN, SREBF1, FADS2) in RM-1 cells, with Histone 3 serving as the internal control, the original Western blot bands are provided in Supplementary Material 6. Statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA compared to the LA group. Significance indicators: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001

          Further KEGG enrichment analysis focused on lipid metabolism-related pathways (Fig. 3E). The results demonstrated significant enrichment in pathways including fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid degradation, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and bile acid biosynthesis. Energy metabolism-related pathways, such as the AMPK signaling pathway and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, were also closely associated with lipid metabolism. Sankey diagram analysis identified key genes involved in these differential pathways, including aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 family member (ALDH2), acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain (ACADVL), carbonyl reductase 4 (CBR4), hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 4 (HSD17B4), and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 2 (PCSK2) (Fig. 3F). Specifically, ACADVL and HSD17B4, involved in fatty acid metabolism and degradation pathways, suggest that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism by regulating the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. CBR4, associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, further emphasizes CDCA’s role in regulating fatty acid composition. Additionally, genes related to cholesterol metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis, such as ALDH2, indicate that CDCA may indirectly participate in the regulation of lipid homeostasis by affecting cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.
          Building upon RNA-Seq analyses and previous experimental findings, the regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid and fatty acid metabolism were further investigated. Key genes associated with lipid synthesis include SREBF1 and Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC), while genes pivotal in fatty acid metabolism encompass FASN and Fatty Acid Desaturases 1–3 (FADS1-3). The mRNA expression levels of these critical factors were assessed (Fig. 3G–L), and CDCA was found to significantly downregulate their expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis further confirmed the downregulation of lipid metabolism-related proteins, including FASN, SREBF1, and FADS2, upon CDCA treatment (Fig. 3M). Collectively, these findings suggest that CDCA modulates lipid metabolism by downregulating the expression of genes and proteins involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism, highlighting its potential application in regulating lipid metabolic processes.

          Regulation of sebaceous gland activity and lipid accumulation by CDCA in golden hamsters
          To elucidate the mechanisms underlying CDCA’s effects on lipid metabolism, this study utilized golden hamsters—an animal model characterized by a well-developed sebaceous gland system. Upon intradermal injection of CDCA into the sebaceous gland region, dermoscopic examination revealed a slight, non-significant reduction in the area of this region, accompanied by mild local inflammation and decreased melanin deposition (Fig. 4A). Oil Red O staining indicated that CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation in the sebaceous gland area, indicating its regulatory role in lipid metabolism (Fig. 4B–C). Further histological analysis through Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining showed no significant morphological changes in sebaceous gland tissue structure, suggesting that CDCA does not cause structural damage to the glands; however, a noticeable reduction in gland size was observed (Fig. 4D–E). Immunofluorescence staining revealed a significant decrease in Ki67 expression in peripheral sebaceous gland cells, indicating reduced cellular activity (Fig. 4G). Additionally, the expression levels of AR and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), both closely associated with lipid metabolism, were diminished following CDCA treatment. This finding aligns with observations in RM-1 cells, where CDCA not only regulates lipid metabolism but also affects AR expression. These results suggest that CDCA may modulate sebaceous

        In summary, the study demonstrates that CDCA regulates sebaceous gland homeostasis by reducing lipid accumulation and cellular activity, potentially through the modulation of AR and PPAR-γ. Importantly, this effect occurs without disrupting the overall glandular structure, providing a theoretical basis for the application of CDCA in treating sebaceous gland-related disorders.
        
          Regulation of fatty acid composition and lipid accumulation by CDCA in primary sebaceous gland cells
          Building upon previous in vivo findings demonstrating that CDCA inhibits lipid accumulation and AR expression in the sebaceous glands of golden hamsters, its effects on sebaceous gland cells were further investigated using a primary sebaceous gland cell model.
          Lipidomic analysis (Fig. 5A) revealed that CDCA treatment significantly altered the fatty acid composition in primary sebaceous gland cells, including increased levels of various unsaturated fatty acids (such as linoleic acid and arachidonic acid) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, while decreasing certain saturated fatty acids (like palmitic acid). These changes suggest that CDCA optimizes the fatty acid profile by enhancing anti-inflammatory fatty acids (e.g., linoleic acid, which promotes skin barrier repair) and reducing pro-inflammatory saturated fatty acids.

          Further Deep DIA proteomic analysis (Fig. 5B) unveiled the regulatory mechanisms of CDCA. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that CDCA modulates pathways related to fatty acid metabolism and degradation, including β-oxidation and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, CDCA significantly impacts mitochondrial function-related pathways (such as ATP synthesis and mitochondrial metabolism), implying its influence on lipid metabolism through mitochondrial energy regulation.
          A CCK-8 assay identified a non-toxic concentration of CDCA for primary sebaceous gland cells (25 µmol/L) (Fig. 5C). Nile Red staining (Fig. 5E and G) further confirmed that CDCA inhibits lipid accumulation in primary sebaceous gland cells. Under linoleic acid (0.0125 mmol/L) stimulation, CDCA significantly suppressed lipid accumulation, demonstrating its direct regulatory effect on sebocyte lipid metabolism.
          CDCA reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in primary sebaceous gland cells, mirroring the effects observed in RM-1 cells. Moreover, considering the association between lipid accumulation and androgens, CDCA decreased AR expression and lipid accumulation induced by 2-DHT (Fig. 5H–K), aligning with effects observed in RM-1 cells.
          In summary, CDCA regulates sebaceous lipid metabolism through multiple mechanisms, including altering fatty acid composition, modulating metabolic pathways, affecting mitochondrial function, and concurrently regulating AR expression. These findings underscore CDCA’s pivotal role in lipid metabolism regulation and its potential therapeutic value in treating lipid metabolism-related disorders.
        
      
    
    
      Discussion
      Lipid metabolism plays a central role in maintaining essential physiological processes such as cellular function, energy balance, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism not only affects normal physiological functions but is also closely associated with the onset and progression of various diseases [11, 21, 22]. Recent studies have demonstrated that CDCA, a primary active component of bear bile, exhibits significant potential in regulating lipid metabolic disorders [20]. This study further investigated the role of CDCA in lipid metabolism regulation. The effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism were systematically examined using various cell models, including RM-1 cells, primary sebaceous gland cells, and in vivo experiments targeting the sebaceous gland area of golden hamsters. The results indicated that CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation across these different cell and animal models, primarily by modulating fatty acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
      Initially, CDCA’s regulatory effects on lipids were validated using two cell lines. In RM-1 cells, CDCA significantly inhibited LA-induced lipid accumulation, exhibiting noticeable effects even at lower concentrations (IC10, 0.05 µmol/L), outperforming other bile acids such as UDCA. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that CDCA’s impact on RM-1 lipid metabolism was primarily focused on the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and energy metabolism. PCR and Western blot results indicate that CDCA significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of key genes such as SREBF1, ACC, FASN, FADS1-3, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). Inhibition of ACC and FASN directly affected de novo fatty acid synthesis, while downregulation of FADS and SCD1 might have reduced the production of unsaturated fatty acids, thereby influencing the composition of intracellular fatty acids. In primary sebaceous gland cells, lipidomics analysis further confirmed CDCA’s regulatory effects on fatty acid composition [23–25]. CDCA treatment significantly upregulated the content of various unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., LA, arachidonic acid) while inhibiting the expression of certain saturated fatty acids (e.g., palmitic acid). This regulation not only optimizes fatty acid composition but may also improve skin condition by increasing the proportion of anti-inflammatory fatty acids (e.g., LA).
      This study revealed the regulatory effects of CDCA on fatty acid metabolism and, for the first time, systematically explored its impact on energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. In RM-1 cells, a significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was observed following CDCA treatment, suggesting that CDCA might have influenced the cellular energy metabolic state by regulating mitochondrial function. RNA-Seq analysis further supported this view, showing significant changes in energy metabolism-related pathways such as ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling after CDCA treatment. This aligns with recent research published in Nano Letters, which demonstrated that CDCA-loaded nanoparticles can reduce adipocyte size by inducing mitochondrial functions, including promoting β-oxidation [26]. Proteomic results from primary sebaceous gland cells also confirmed this conclusion, indicating that CDCA not only affects fatty acid metabolism but also significantly regulates processes related to mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation. This consistent effect across different cell types suggests that CDCA may influence energy metabolism and mitochondrial function through a universal mechanism, thereby regulating fatty acid metabolism and balance. Additionally, studies by Liu J et al. have shown that CDCA may promote lipid peroxidation by activating the ROS/p38 MAPK/DGAT1 axis and can directly bind to mitochondria, inducing mitochondrial changes in AML cells, including swelling and cristae reduction [27]. These findings complement previous discoveries and collectively reveal the multifaceted role of CDCA in regulating energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.
      Through RNA-Seq and proteomic analyses, several signaling pathways potentially involved in CDCA’s mechanism of action were identified. The AMPK signaling pathway was likely a key mechanism by which CDCA regulates lipid metabolism. Additionally, changes in TGF-β and FoxO signaling pathways suggested that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism by regulating cell differentiation and metabolism. Notably, CDCA’s impact on the GnRH signaling pathway was also observed, which may explain its regulatory effects on hormone-related lipid metabolism. In the experimental validation section, RM-1 cells were stimulated with DHT to induce AR overexpression, and CDCA was found to reduce AR expression as well. This indicates that CDCA can regulate hormone expression while modulating lipids, further confirming the close relationship between abnormal lipid accumulation and hormone levels.
      Comprehensive results indicated that CDCA exhibited bidirectional regulation of fatty acid metabolism. On one hand, it inhibits fatty acid synthesis by downregulating genes such as SREBF1 and ACC. On the other hand, Deep DIA analysis suggests that CDCA might promote fatty acid degradation by activating β-oxidation phosphorylation-related pathways. This bidirectional regulatory mechanism enabled CDCA to more precisely balance intracellular fatty acid levels; moreover, it can optimize fatty acid composition, providing a theoretical basis for its potential application in diseases related to lipid metabolic disorders.
      Based on the research findings and existing literature, CDCA emerged as a versatile regulator of lipid metabolism with promising therapeutic applications. In skin-related lipid metabolism disorders, CDCA may hold potential value in the treatment of acne and seborrheic alopecia. Observations in primary sebaceous gland cells indicate that CDCA suppresses lipid accumulation and optimizes fatty acid composition, providing direct evidence for its potential application in these conditions. By reducing sebum accumulation and increasing the proportion of anti-inflammatory fatty acids, CDCA may help alleviate acne symptoms [7, 28]. In the context of seborrheic alopecia, CDCA’s regulation of sebaceous gland activity could assist in controlling excessive oil accumulation. In diseases associated with lipid metabolism abnormalities, such as prostate cancer, CDCA’s potential role warrants attention. CDCA exhibited inhibitory effects on lipid metabolism and modulated AR expression in RM-1 prostate cancer cells, providing novel insights into its therapeutic potential for prostate cancer. CDCA may inhibit tumor cell growth and metastasis by modulating lipid metabolism and hormone signaling pathways [29–31].
      In summary, CDCA’s consistent effects across various cell models, its comprehensive regulation of lipid metabolism, and its impact on energy metabolism and mitochondrial function laid the foundation for its potential application in the treatment of multiple diseases. Future research should further explore CDCA’s mechanisms of action, optimize administration methods, and conduct preclinical and clinical studies to fully harness its potential in treating lipid metabolism-related diseases.
      
        Study strengths and limitations
        This study offers several important strengths. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics, a comprehensive and multi-layered understanding of how CDCA regulates lipid metabolism was established. This integrative approach was applied across RM-1 prostate cancer cells, primary sebaceous gland cells, and in vivo golden hamster models, ensuring both mechanistic depth and translational relevance. Notably, CDCA exhibited a bidirectional regulatory pattern—suppressing de novo fatty acid synthesis through SREBF1, ACC, and FASN, while simultaneously promoting fatty acid degradation pathways such as β-oxidation. The study also uncovered a previously underappreciated role of CDCA in mitochondrial regulation and energy metabolism, supported by consistent findings across multiple datasets and functional assays. Furthermore, the dual applicability of CDCA in both dermatological (acne and seborrheic disorders) and oncological (prostate cancer) settings broadens its therapeutic significance and opens up possibilities for cross-disciplinary interventions.
        Despite these contributions, several limitations should be acknowledged. The study did not clarify whether CDCA’s effects are mediated through canonical bile acid receptors such as FXR or TGR5, which could provide more targeted mechanistic insight. Although key signaling pathways like AMPK and MAPK were highlighted in the omics data, their involvement was not directly confirmed using pharmacological or genetic methods. Additionally, the in vivo validation was limited to the sebaceous gland model, while findings related to prostate cancer were based solely on in vitro assays, thus limiting their immediate clinical translation. Lastly, although CDCA is already used clinically, its long-term safety and toxicity profile, particularly in the context of topical or dermatological applications, remained to be evaluated. Future studies focusing on receptor mechanisms, pathway validation, and formulation safety will be essential to fully translate CDCA into therapeutic use.
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      CDCA demonstrates potential in modulating lipid metabolism by reducing lipid accumulation and reshaping fatty acid composition in RM-1 prostate cancer cells and sebaceous gland cells. It also influences mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, with in vivo validation confirming its regulatory effect on sebaceous gland homeostasis. These findings provide a foundation for developing novel, mechanism-based interventions to address sebaceous and metabolic disorders in a more targeted and sustainable manner. Further studies are warranted to optimize delivery strategies and comprehensively assess the safety and translational potential of CDCA for long-term therapeutic use.

Title: Dupilumab treatment for prurigo nodularis: a retrospective study of 76 patients

Abstract: IntroductionPrurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic pruritic and inflammatory skin disorder and dupilumab is currently the only biologic agent approved in China for the treatment.AimTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in managing moderate to severe PN through a retrospective study of 76 patients.Material and methodsA retrospective analysis was conducted of clinical and laboratory data from PN patients who received regular dupilumab treatment for 52 weeks at the Dermatology Department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between March 2021 and June 2023. Assessments were made at baseline (week 0), and at weeks 4, 8, 16, 26, and 52 using prurigo nodule counts, Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) scores, Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores to evaluate clinical symptoms and pruritus. Adverse events occurring post-treatment were also recorded to assess the drug’s safety and efficacy.ResultsA total of 76 patients with moderate to severe PN were included in this study. By week 52, there were significant reductions in prurigo nodule counts, IGA scores, NRS scores, and DLQI scores. Prurigo nodule counts decreased from a baseline of 74.64 ±33.45 to 2.3 ±0.9, IGA scores from 3.53 ±0.54 to 0.54 ±0.33, NRS scores from 7.65 ±2.27 to 1.01 ±0.65, and DLQI scores from 18.46 ±4.53 to 1.55 ±0.68, with all differences being statistically significant (p < 0.05). Seven patients experienced injection site reactions, and 2 patients developed facial erythema, which resolved either spontaneously or with symptomatic treatment. No other adverse events were reported.ConclusionsDupilumab effectively reduces the number of PN, improves IGA scores, alleviates pruritus, and enhances quality of life in patients with moderate to severe PN, with a high safety profile.

Body: Introduction
      Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic pruritic and inflammatory skin disorder characterized by symmetrically distributed, often on the extremities and occasionally on the trunk, keratotic papules and nodules accompanied by intense and unbearable itching [1]. The aetiology of PN remains unclear; however, it can be triggered by various factors including skin diseases, systemic conditions, and neuropsychological factors, with their interactions exacerbating the skin lesions [2]. Type 2 inflammatory responses are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease [3].
      The treatment options for PN are diverse, and there is no consensus on the standard treatment regimen. Therapeutic approaches include both systemic and non-systemic treatments [4]. Non-systemic therapies, considered first-line, encompass topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI), and intralesional corticosteroid injections. However, the prolonged use of TCS may lead to adverse effects such as skin atrophy, telangiectasia, acne, and folliculitis [5]. Systemic treatments include gabapentinoids, antidepressants, immunosuppressants, and biological agents such as dupilumab and nemolizumab [6]. Methotrexate [7] and thalidomide [8] have also been reported to effectively alleviate inflammation and pruritus, but their long-term use is limited by adverse effects. Dupilumab received FDA approval for PN in September 2022 and has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing pruritus and skin lesions with rare associated side effects [9]. A phase 3 clinical trial suggested that nemolizumab had good efficacy in the treatment of PN [10], and it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of PN in August 2024. However, nemolizumab has yet to obtain the approval for marketing in China.
      Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the alpha subunit of the IL-4/13 receptor. By blocking the biological activities of IL-4 and IL-13, dupilumab inhibits type 2 inflammatory responses [11]. Since IL-4 and IL-13 are implicated in the pruritic mechanisms associated with PN, dupilumab may offer therapeutic benefits for this condition. Dupilumab has been approved in China for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in patients aged 6 years and older.
    
    
      Aim
      This study retrospectively evaluates the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in managing moderate to severe PN, and the results are summarized as follows.
    
    
      Material and methods
      
        Study population
        A total of 76 patients diagnosed with moderate to severe PN and treated with dupilumab at the Dermatology Outpatient Clinic of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from March 2021 to June 2023 were included in the study. Diagnostic criteria: (1) presence of refractory nodular skin lesions; (2) pruritus duration of ≥ 6 weeks; and (3) history and/or signs of repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing. Inclusion criteria: (1) meeting the above diagnostic criteria and confirmed PN diagnosis; (2) disease severity assessed as moderate to severe by the same primary dermatologist, with Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) ≥ 3 and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ≥ 4; (3) age ≥ 18 years at the time of initial treatment; (4) history of inadequate response to traditional PN treatments; and (5) signed informed consent for dupilumab treatment and good compliance, with all patients completing the 52-week treatment. Exclusion criteria: (1) pregnant and lactating patients; (2) patients with active systemic infections such as parasitic infections, hepatitis, tuberculosis, syphilis, or HIV; (3) patients with progressive malignant tumours; (4) patients with other severe underlying diseases that could interfere with efficacy evaluation; (5) differential diagnoses such as nodular pemphigoid, skin tumours, or scabies; and (6) patients who had received systemic phototherapy, other biological agents, immunosuppressants, or small molecule drugs within 6 months before or during the treatment period.
      
      
        Treatment protocol
        Patients enrolled in the study received subcutaneous injections of dupilumab administered by trained professionals. The initial dose was 600 mg, given as two subcutaneous injections. Thereafter, 300 mg was injected every 2 weeks. After 16 weeks of treatment, the maintenance dose was adjusted based on the patient’s condition by the clinician, either continuing with 300 mg every 2 weeks or extending to 300 mg every 3–4 weeks, administered regularly. Dupilumab injection solution (Dupilumab), brand name: Dupixent®, manufactured by Sanofi, was provided in pre-filled syringes at a dosage of 300 mg (2.0 ml) per syringe, with two syringes per box.
        During the course of dupilumab treatment, patients were allowed to concurrently use oral antihistamines, topical moisturizers, TCS, and TCI.
      
      
        Study methods
        The retrospective study collected general patient information from outpatient medical records. During and after the dupilumab treatment period, follow-up phone interviews were conducted by dedicated personnel. Data on the number of nodules, IGA, NRS, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores were recorded at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 16, 26, and 52 of treatment [12]. Adverse events post-treatment were also documented.
        
          General information
          Basic information included patient name, age, gender, and visit date. Medical history data encompassed age at initial onset, duration of the disease, diagnosis and treatment history, atopic history, past medical history, and drug allergy history.
        
        
          Efficacy evaluation criteria
          IGA Score: Severity was graded based on the number of prurigo nodules: Grade 0 (no lesions, 0 nodules), Grade 1 (almost clear, 1–5 nodules), Grade 2 (mild, 6–19 nodules), Grade 3 (moderate, 20–100 nodules), and Grade 4 (severe, more than 100 nodules).
          NRS Score: Patients self-rated the intensity of the most severe itch experienced in the past 24 h on a scale of 0 to 10. A score of 0 indicated no itching, 1–3 indicated mild itching (not affecting sleep), 4–6 indicated moderate itching, 7–9 indicated severe itching (disturbing sleep), and 10 represented the worst imaginable itching.
          DLQI Score: The DLQI was used to assess the impact of the skin disease on the patient’s quality of life over the past week. It included 10 items covering symptoms such as itching, soreness, pain, stinging, embarrassment, impact on shopping and housework, choice of clothing, social and leisure activities, sports, work or study, relationships, sexual activity, and the burden of treatment. Each item was scored from 0 to 3, with a total score range of 0–30. Higher scores indicated a greater impact on quality of life: 0–1 (no effect), 2–5 (mild effect), 6–10 (moderate effect), 11–20 (large effect), and 21–30 (extremely large effect).
        
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 29.0 software. Categorical data were expressed as percentages (%). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the normality of continuous data. Normally distributed data were analysed using paired t-tests, while non-normally distributed data were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Data were described as mean ± standard deviation (SD), with a significance level set at p < 0.05.

      Efficacy analysis
      All patients completed the 52-week treatment. Dupilumab has shown significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe PN. During the initial 16 weeks, patients received a regular dosage of 300 mg every 2 weeks. After completing the 16-week treatment, patients with severe conditions continued with bi-weekly injections, while those with marked improvement extended the injection interval to every 3–4 weeks. There were significant reductions in the number of nodules, IGA scores, NRS scores, and DLQI scores at weeks 4, 8, 16, 26, and 52 of treatment (Table 2). These differences were statistically significant (Figure 1).

      This study meticulously documented the safety of dupilumab in treating moderate to severe PN. The primary adverse reactions observed during treatment included injection site reactions and facial erythema (Table 3). These reactions were mild in severity; injection site reactions resolved spontaneously and did not impact subsequent treatments after changing the injection site. Facial erythema was transient and improved with symptomatic treatment. Throughout the 52-week treatment period, no patients experienced serious adverse events requiring discontinuation of therapy.

      Discussion
      PN is often associated with severe pruritus and is resistant to conventional treatments. The intense itching compels patients to self-mutilate through scratching, resulting in disfigurement, depression, and significant impairment of quality of life. Patients with PN experience considerable deterioration in quality of life, with the vast majority (97.2%) trapped in an itch-scratch cycle, leading to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depressive states due to the severe and unrelenting pruritus. Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that PN is associated with Th2 inflammatory immune responses [13, 14]. Various inflammatory cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of PN, with increased expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-31 detectable in prurigo lesions [3, 15]. It is also related to neurogenic inflammation triggered by repeated scratching of the lesions. Studies have shown strong expression of p75NTR in the lesional skin of PN, indicating specific neuropathic involvement in PN. Additionally, cortistatin (CST) and substance P (SP) have been detected in the epidermis. The SP/MRGPRs pathway plays a significant role in the immune response and pruritus associated with PN [16]. There is also evidence suggesting that immune processes involving Th1, Th17, and Th22 pathways play a role in its development [2, 17]. Current evidence indicates that the JAK-STAT pathway is also involved in the pathogenesis of PN [18].
      Traditional systemic therapies for PN such as thalidomide, glucocorticoids, and immunosuppressants like cyclosporine have shown limited clinical efficacy and significant potential toxic effects. These treatments may also impose a greater health burden on elderly patients with comorbid conditions [19–22]. With the emergence of new increased expression of mRNAs for IL-4, IL-17, IL-22 and IL-31 in skin lesions of subacute and chronic forms of prurigo therapeutic targets in recent years, novel therapies have gradually been developed. These include biologics such as dupilumab, nemolizumab, tralokinumab, and lebrikizumab, as well as various small molecule agents like neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, Janus kinase inhibitors, and µ-opioid receptor antagonists/m-antagonists/k-agonists. These therapies have shown promising efficacy [23, 24]. However, except dupilumab and nemolizumab, the sample sizes for these treatments remain relatively small, and they have not yet been approved for the treatment of PN.
      Since its approval for atopic dermatitis (AD), dupilumab has been widely utilized, demonstrating clear efficacy and safety [14, 25]. PN shares certain clinical and pathophysiological features with AD, which is considered one of the most relevant disease factors for PN. This shared pathophysiology likely underlies the effectiveness of dupilumab in treating PN [3, 26, 27]. Dupilumab functions by inhibiting IL-4 signalling through binding to type I and type II receptors and IL-13 signalling through binding to type II receptors, thus blocking Th2 cell-mediated inflammatory responses. This mechanism disrupts the distinctive itch-scratch cycle in PN, leading to clinical remission [28]. Therefore, we selected dupilumab for the treatment of moderate to severe PN and aimed to evaluate its efficacy and safety in this patient population.
      We present real-world data from a 52-week follow-up study of 76 patients with PN who were treated with dupilumab at the Suzhou Hospital, China. The data indicate that dupilumab significantly improved both the clinical signs and manifestations of PN. The average age of onset for PN in our cohort was 50 years, with no significant gender differences noted, and the majority of patients had comorbid conditions.
      Our findings demonstrate a reduction in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores from a baseline of 7.65 to 6.24 at the 4-week follow-up and further to 0.54 at the 52-week follow-up. DLQI scores decreased from a baseline of 18.46 to 13.35 at the 4-week follow-up and to 1.55 at the 52-week follow-up. These results confirm the substantial efficacy of dupilumab in improving both pruritus and quality of life for PN patients.
      The NRS and DLQI scores showed more pronounced improvements in the early follow-up periods (4 weeks and 8 weeks), with subsequent, albeit less dramatic, improvements observed at the 52-week follow-up. This indicates that dupilumab has a notable impact on alleviating pruritus and enhancing quality of life in the initial treatment phase. Conversely, the IGA scores and nodule counts did not exhibit significant reduction during the first 16 weeks but demonstrated more pronounced improvement in later follow-up periods (16 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks). This suggests that dupilumab is more effective in reducing disease severity and nodule count with prolonged treatment. Thus, dupilumab is not only effective in the early stages of treatment but also maintains its therapeutic efficacy over the long term.
      Beck et al. [29] reported in 2018 on 3 cases in the United States, demonstrating that within 12 weeks of treatment with dupilumab, there was a notable reduction in pruritus symptoms, a decrease in the overall size and number of prurigo lesions, and a marked improvement in quality of life. In a retrospective study conducted in Italy by Chiricozzi et al. [30] in 2020, significant improvement in skin lesions was first observed at 4 weeks, with further amelioration in pruritus and PN lesions evident by 36 weeks. Clinical improvement was assessed via the IGA, and both pruritus and insomnia, as measured by the NRS, showed substantial reductions.
      A long-term retrospective study by Georgakopoulos et al. [31] in Canada in 2021 found that 78.9% of patients reported a subjective improvement in pruritus by 16 weeks, with 41.17% of patients demonstrating clinical symptom improvement by 52 weeks. In a 2023 real-world observational study conducted in China, Fang and Lian [32] observed that pruritus symptoms in PN patients exhibited rapid relief within 2 weeks of initiating treatment, with significant improvement in skin lesions noted at both 4 and 8 weeks. Additionally, Cao et al. [25] in a 2023 systematic review concluded that dupilumab treatment led to a significant reduction in NRS scores at weeks 4, 12, 16 and beyond 16 weeks, with at least 87.5% of PN patients achieving clinical remission. These findings are congruent with our prior clinical trial results.
      Conversely, Cunha et al. [33] reported in 2022 from Portugal that a patient exhibited a decrease in NRS scores and a reduction in nodule count only after 3 months of dupilumab treatment. This suggests that adult patients with severe, treatment-resistant chronic PN, may require an extended period to achieve therapeutic response when treated with dupilumab.
      Comparing the data from dupilumab treatment for atopic dermatitis [34–36] with for PN patients, it appears that dupilumab may require a longer duration of treatment to achieve its full therapeutic effects in PN. Unlike AD patients, those with PN experience a slower reduction in pruritus and a more gradual resolution of skin lesions.
      In a comparison of our findings with a phase III open-label extension study by Blauvelt et al. [37], it is evident that the reduction in IGA scores was significantly greater in AD patients (1.5 points) compared to PN patients (0.19 points) at the 4-week mark. In terms of VAS scores, AD patients exhibited a more substantial decrease in pruritus, reaching 5.0, whereas PN patients had a lesser initial reduction of 1.41 points. Additionally, DLQI scores indicated that AD patients experienced a more significant improvement in quality of life (4.9 points) during the early treatment phase compared to PN patients (5.11 points).
      However, in the later stages of treatment (16 weeks to 52 weeks), PN patients showed a more pronounced decrease in VAS scores, indicating more substantial relief from pruritus. Furthermore, the DLQI scores for PN patients decreased significantly in the later stages, reflecting a notable improvement in quality of life, while the improvement in AD patients was relatively gradual.
      These differences in response times may be attributable to the distinct pathological characteristics and therapeutic response mechanisms of the diseases. AD patients may exhibit a more rapid initial response to dupilumab, but as treatment progresses, the rate of improvement may plateau. In contrast, PN patients may have a slower initial response, but with continued treatment, the therapeutic effects become more evident, demonstrating more significant long-term improvements, particularly in pruritus relief and quality of life enhancement.
      In this research, adverse effects were generally mild and self-limiting, resolving either spontaneously or with symptomatic treatment. Notably, no cases of conjunctivitis – a commonly reported adverse reaction – were observed, and no patients discontinued therapy due to adverse effects, underscoring the favourable tolerability profile of dupilumab. Further investigation is warranted to characterize the nature of injection site reactions and determine their relationship with drug dosage or administration frequency. Additionally, the occurrence of facial erythema might be attributed to either local drug effects or individual skin sensitivity, necessitating further exploration of its underlying mechanisms.
      In this research, limitations are conspicuous. We adopted the method of open design with no control and a pre-post self-comparison protocol was implemented. The enrolled patients had a history of poor response to conventional PN treatments. Since we hypothesized that the probability of clinical improvement without dupilumab was relatively low based on existing evidence and clinical experience, this self-comparison approach was selected. PN is a chronic, stubborn skin disease with patients suffering from severe itching and few treatment options. For patients open to biological agents, a placebo control might lead to early treatment dropout due to lack of expected results, causing ethical and practical issues. The study was in an outpatient setting. Patient communication about condition changes made a single-blind condition unfeasible. So, an open-label retrospective study was done. Despite its limitations like inability to confirm causal links as in a randomized trial and weaker evidence, it allows data collection for future in-depth studies, and provides valuable insights for future research under better conditions.
      We allowed patients to use antihistamines and TCS, which might lead to potential biases in the final outcomes. Given that dupilumab takes time to exert its effects and there is no contraindication for concomitant medications, we did not compel patients to discontinue the use of antihistamines and TCS with less-than-ideal efficacy until the skin rashes and itching were truly alleviated.
      While the infrequent and mild nature of adverse events supports the overall safety of dupilumab, the study’s limitations include a relatively small sample size and the potential overlap between atopic dermatitis and PN. Such overlap could impact treatment efficacy as patients with AD might exhibit a more pronounced initial response to dupilumab, potentially skewing the observed rates of clinical symptom relief. Future research should address these limitations by incorporating larger sample sizes and accounting for the effects of disease overlap on treatment outcomes.
      The rates of observed clinical symptom relief may be affected by baseline patient traits, including disease duration, severity, and comorbid conditions. Thorough analyses of such baseline factors are crucial for pinpointing variables that notably influence treatment effectiveness. Moreover, patient compliance is crucial for assessing the long-term consequences of dupilumab treatment as it facilitates understanding the sustained efficacy of the drug in treating PN and ensures persistent adherence to the prescribed treatment protocol. These further analyses will provide a more comprehensive assessment of dupilumab’s efficacy, safety, and clinical relevance in the management of PN, thereby offering more robust evidence for its use in clinical practice.
    
    
      Conclusions
      Our data indicate that dupilumab is a highly effective and safe treatment option for PN. Dupilumab has shown significant benefits in reducing the number of prurigo nodules, improving IGA scores, alleviating pruritus, and enhancing the DLQI scores in patients with moderate to severe PN, while maintaining a favourable safety profile.
      Compared to atopic dermatitis, patients with PN may require a longer duration of treatment with dupilumab to achieve comparable therapeutic effects. Although the emergence of various small-molecule drugs has expanded the treatment options for PN, these alternatives often present with greater limitations or side effects.
      Currently, dupilumab stands out as a leading option for the treatment of PN due to its efficacy and safety. Future research should focus on conducting rigorous randomized controlled trials to further validate these findings. Such studies will facilitate the optimization of treatment regimens and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies tailored to individual patient profiles, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life for PN patients.

Title: Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Association with Ulcerative Proctitis: Surgical Management in a Refractory Case to Topical and Systemic Treatment

Abstract: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a challenging dermatological condition, can be described as a chronic, painful, follicular, occlusive disease that is characterized by painful nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts generally located in the intertriginous skin areas. This disorder places a considerable burden on affected individuals and often leads to significant impairment in quality of life for those grappling with its persistent and recurrent nature. We present the case of a 20-year-old male patient known to have ulcerative proctitis and diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2020, for which he underwent various topical and systemic treatments, with periods of remission and recurrent flares without managing to obtain complete remission of HS. In our dermatology service, the patient underwent two surgical unroofing procedures combined with punch debridement, with the wounds being allowed to heal by secondary intention. This choice of treatment delivered great results with favorable outcomes, without recurrence of the lesions, proving to be an effective method for managing HS. By presenting this case, we underline the role of surgical procedures in managing HS, and our desire is to emphasize the importance of comprehensive understanding of this enigmatic and complex condition for more effective management strategies in patients with refractory disease.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Hidradenitis suppurativa, also known as acne inversa [1], stands as a dermatological enigma characterized by the chronic and debilitating nature of its inflammatory skin lesions. HS is a chronic follicular occlusive disease affecting the follicular portion of the folliculopilosebaceous units (FPSUs), characterized by the development of painful nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts, that places a considerable burden on affected individuals [2]. This disorder primarily affects the intertriginous areas, such as the axillae, groin, and buttocks, and often leads to significant impairment in quality of life for those grappling with its persistent and recurrent nature [3].
      The epidemiology of HS is a dynamic landscape, with estimates suggesting a prevalence of approximately 1% in the general population [4]. However, this prevalence might be underestimated due to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis, underscoring the need for heightened clinical awareness. HS typically emerges in early adulthood, presenting a peak onset in the second and third decades of life. The gender predilection is notable, with a higher prevalence in females, although the disease’s severity may be more pronounced in males [5].
      The pathogenesis of HS involves a multifaceted interplay of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. Current evidence suggests a polygenic inheritance, with mutations in genes associated with inflammation, innate immunity, and the follicular epithelium contributing to disease susceptibility. Dysregulation of the immune response, particularly involving the interleukin pathway, plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory cascades observed in HS [6].
      The probable instigating factor for the initial formation of HS lesions is follicular occlusion, which stems from the proliferation of ductal keratinocytes, resulting in follicular hyperkeratosis and blockage. It is suggested that associated factors within this process are the hormones and nicotine, which have a negative impact on the follicular epithelium. The resulting anoxia within the follicular duct, induced by follicular epithelial hyperplasia, contributes to the disturbance of the usual terminal differentiation of follicular keratinocytes, obstructing the follicular passage and subsequent follicular rupture [7]. 
      The occlusion of hair follicles, subsequent inflammation, and bacterial colonization contribute to the formation of abscesses and sinus tracts characteristic of HS lesions. Skin tunnels that have been firmly established ultimately emerge onto the surface of the skin, undergoing persistent inflammation. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, and poor diet further exacerbate the disease, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the disease’s pathophysiology [8]. Furthermore, several studies indicate a correlation between HS and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [9], both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) [10], as they exhibit some similarities to HS regarding clinical manifestations, genetic predisposition, and immunological characteristics.
      Regarding its clinical manifestation, hidradenitis suppurativa unfolds with painful, inflamed nodules that may progress to abscesses and sinus tracts. These lesions predominantly manifest in intertriginous areas, including the axillae (most common site), inguinal area, inframammary, and perianal regions. The formation of skin tunnels, clusters of exposed comedones (referred to as tombstone comedones), and scarring are outcomes observed in cases of recurring or persistent disease. The disease course is generally marked by recurrent flares and remission periods, which contribute to its chronic nature [11]. 
      Disease onset typically occurs post-puberty, often in the second and third decades of life, and there is a correlation between the earlier onset of HS and a more extensive and widespread disease [12]. Furthermore, diagnosis of the condition is often delayed, especially in cases categorized as ‘mild’ and intermittent, the primary inflammatory nodules being commonly misdiagnosed as furuncles [13]. On top of that, the lack of a specific diagnostic test demands a meticulous clinical assessment for the diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa. The diagnosis relies on the presence of typical lesions, typical topography, and chronicity and recurrences [2]. Diagnostic criteria, including the Hurley staging system and the International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4), aid in categorizing disease severity and guiding treatment decisions. 
      The Hurley clinical staging system is commonly employed to categorize patients with HS into three levels of disease severity: Stage I: formation of abscesses (single or multiple) without skin tunnels or cicatrization/scarring; Stage II: recurrent abscesses accompanied by skin tunnels and scarring, with single or multiple lesions widely separated; and Stage III: widespread or nearly widespread involvement, or the presence of multiple interconnected skin tunnels and abscesses across the entire affected area [14]. The majority of HS patients typically fall under stage I disease [15].
      IHS4 represents a validated instrument for dynamically evaluating the severity of hidradenitis suppurativa. IHS4 is determined by tallying the number of nodules (multiplied by 1), abscesses (multiplied by 2), and draining tunnels (multiplied by 4). A cumulative score of 3 or below indicates mild disease, 4–10 denotes moderate severity, and 11 or higher indicates severe HS [16]. By incorporating these criteria, IHS4 offers clinicians a standardized framework for assessing and monitoring HS severity, facilitating improved treatment decisions and patient management strategies.
      Managing hidradenitis suppurativa necessitates a nuanced, multimodal approach, reflecting the chronic and relapsing nature of the disease. Lifestyle modifications, encompassing weight loss and smoking cessation, emerge as foundational pillars of disease management [17]. The severity of the disease has a significant impact on the approach to treatment. 
      In milder cases (Hurley stage I), therapy aims to reduce the burden of the disease (i.e., to limit the development of lesions and inhibit the progression of the disease) and to improve acute, symptomatic lesions. The treatment consists of topical and systemic antibiotics that target bacterial colonization, mitigating inflammation [18]. Although the initial therapy in these cases consists generally of oral tetracyclines, topical clindamycin is occasionally considered and might serve as a viable initial approach for individuals with mild disease. Oral antiandrogenic medications and metformin represent supplementary treatment choices that can be employed independently or in combination with antibiotics. Further measures for managing symptomatic inflamed nodules encompass intralesional corticosteroid injections, punch debridement (partial unroofing), and the application of topical resorcinol [19].
      A spectrum of interventions comes into play for moderate to severe disease (Hurley stage II or III). Oral antibiotic therapy, intralesional corticosteroid injections, systemic immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies—the latter targeting specific inflammatory pathways—showcase efficacy in controlling disease progression. Furthermore, surgical options, including drainage of abscesses, surgical unroofing, and excision of involved tissue, prove beneficial in refractory cases, although necessitating carefully weighing risks and benefits [20].
      In this case report we present the case of a 20-year-old male known to have ulcerative proctitis and diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2020, for which he underwent two surgical interventions of incision and drainage in another service, various topical treatments (clindamycin 1% solution, resorcinol 15% cream and topical antiseptic washes), and systemic treatments (oral doxycycline), with periods of remission, recurrent flares and persistent worsening of symptoms in recent months. This case report will outline the surgical treatment options chosen, the decisions made, and the subsequent outcome for our patient. By presenting this case, our intention is to underscore the significance of possessing a thorough understanding of this intricate condition. Such understanding is pivotal in devising more effective management strategies, especially for patients grappling with refractory disease.
    
    
      2. Detailed Case Description
      We present a case involving a 20-year-old male, a non-smoker with a normal BMI known with ulcerative proctitis and diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2020, who sought clinical evaluation and specialized treatment in our clinic. 
      In 2015, the patient received a diagnosis of mild ulcerative proctitis and underwent a four-week treatment regimen of topical mesalamine at a daily dose of 1 g, leading to subsequent remission of the disease. Since then, there has been a single episode of disease relapse, effectively managed with topical mesalamine without the necessity for ongoing maintenance therapy.
      The onset of HS symptoms occurred three years before. Since then, the patient has undergone a range of treatments: two surgical interventions of incision and drainage in another service, various topical treatments (clindamycin 1% solution, one application per day, resorcinol 15% cream, one application per day, and topical antiseptic washes) and systemic treatments (oral doxycycline 50 mg once daily for three months), with periods of remission and recurrent flares, without managing to obtain the complete remission of the disease.
      At the current presentation, the dermatological clinical exam reveals typical lesions of HS located in both of the patient’s axillae. In the left axilla, we observed two skin tunnels, one inflammatory nodule, and a thick, linear, rope-like band of scarring (Figure 1a). On the other hand, in the right axilla, we described one solitary skin tunnel and two deep-seated inflamed nodules with minimal scarring (Figure 1b). Following the extent and severity of lesions, the patient was classified as having Hurley stage II disease and an IHS4 score of 15. 
      In instances where the prevention of new lesions proves unsuccessful and medical therapy for established and growing lesions is ineffective, surgery becomes the acknowledged approach for managing hidradenitis suppurativa. Considering this, in the current context of our patient’s presentation, we opted for the surgical management of the axillary lesions.
      Initially, we conducted the surgical treatment of lesions localized in the left axilla under localized anesthesia using lidocaine 1% (Figure 2a). We performed the surgical unroofing of two skin tunnels (Figure 2b) and the punch debridement of one inflammatory nodule (Figure 2c). The punch debridement procedure utilized a 5 mm circular punch instrument to excise the isolated inflammatory nodule, along with a minimal amount of surrounding tissue. 
      In the context of the surgical unroofing technique, the procedure commenced with the delineation of the affected area followed by local anesthesia administration (adrenaline was utilized to prolong the duration of action). Due to the absence of a discernible sinus tract opening, a surgical entry point was established through the overlying skin. A guiding probe was introduced through the surgical entry point and meticulously navigated along the entire length of the sinus tract. Subsequently, an incision was made along the probe’s trajectory, resulting in the detachment of the upper portion of the sinus tract. The entire roof of each tract was meticulously excised, and both the base and margins were explored for concealed entrances to other tunnels. Cellular debris at the base of the tract was debrided, along with any superficial scar tissue and granulation tissue, thereby aiding in the elimination of the biofilm lining the tunnel. Superficial curettage resulted in a uniform, bleeding lesion bed at the subcutaneous level.
      After the procedures, the wounds were allowed to heal by secondary intention (Figure 2d), using just some dressing pads with a silicone wound contact layer. Following the intervention, the patient was prescribed a course of antibiotic therapy consisting of Cefuroxime 500 mg, taken twice daily for a duration of 5 days. The patient was given detailed instructions regarding the wound care regimen to be followed at home, which involved gently cleansing the area with an antiseptic solution, followed by the application of a moist dressing containing a neutral ointment, and sealing with a superabsorbent silicon-lined dressing. The patient diligently followed this home care protocol for 2 weeks. After the follow-up assessment, we advised the patient to apply another ointment with antibacterial and scar-reducing properties, containing silver sulfadiazine. 
      The patient attended follow-up appointments at two weeks (Figure 3a) and four weeks (Figure 3b) post operation, demonstrating a favorable progression of the lesions with no indication of inflammation or infection.
      Subsequently, we performed the surgical management of the lesions localized in the right axilla, performing the surgical unroofing of one skin tunnel and the punch debridement of two inflammatory nodules (Figure 4a), leaving the wounds to heal by secondary intention (Figure 4b). The patient attended follow-up appointments at two weeks (Figure 4c) and four weeks (Figure 4d) post-operation, also showing a favorable evolution. Six months post intervention, the patient is in total remission without any new HS lesions in the axillary region or any other areas. 
    
    
      3. Discussion
      Several risk factors have been statistically established as contributing to the development of hidradenitis suppurativa. Factors such as genetic susceptibility, mechanical stresses on the skin, obesity, smoking, dietary habits, and hormonal influences are frequently mentioned as potential contributors linked to the onset or worsening of HS. Our case diverges, as the patient lacked any of these factors mentioned. He was a non-smoker with a normal BMI, maintained a healthy dietary habit, and had no familial history of genetic susceptibility to the condition.
      Most notably, our patient was known to have mild ulcerative proctitis, diagnosed in 2015 and, at presentation, in clinical remission after the treatment with topical mesalamine. Several studies indicate a correlation between hidradenitis suppurativa and inflammatory bowel disease [9]. Earlier research suggested that the association between HS and IBD was present only in Crohn’s disease [21], with no apparent link to hidradenitis suppurativa in ulcerative colitis [22]. However, this notion has since been disproved, as subsequent studies are increasingly revealing a correlation between HS and ulcerative colitis as well. The most recent study is that of Bingzhou Bao et al., in 2023; theirs was a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study proving a robust causal relationship between IBD of both subtypes (CD and UC) and HS [23]. Concerning the pathophysiological aspect, there is some evidence indicating that IBD and HS share common clinical manifestations [24], genetic predisposition, and immunological profiles [22]; however, further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of the causal connection between IBD and HS.
      As far as treatment is concerned, our patient underwent a variety of interventions to manage the disease. He reported having undergone two surgical procedures involving incision and drainage in another service but experienced a swift recurrence of the lesions. Currently, it has been demonstrated that the customary practice of incision and drainage (I&D) for individual nodules is deemed ineffective and unsuitable for managing hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) [25]. I&D offers only temporary relief, and as it fails to address the actively growing tissue, lesions treated in this manner often experience recurrence [26].
      Our patient was classified as having Hurley stage II disease. In this stage of HS, the primary therapeutic strategy to reduce the disease burden involves using oral antibiotics, typically oral tetracyclines or a combination of oral clindamycin and rifampin [27]. Our patient had previously undergone a three-month course of oral doxycycline at a daily dosage of 50 mg, yielding no substantial improvement in the lesions. Typically, doxycycline is prescribed at a recommended dosage of 100 mg, administered once to twice daily [28]. The suboptimal response to the treatment observed in our patient could be attributed to the lower dosage employed during the course. 
      On the other hand, for the treatment of acute, symptomatic lesions, additional interventions are necessary that may consist of intralesional corticosteroid injections [29], punch debridement, unroofing [30], and topical resorcinol [31]. For our patient, intermittent use of topical resorcinol 15% cream was employed to address newly inflamed nodules, resulting in temporary alleviation of pain; however, unfortunately, upon discontinuation of the medication there was a rapid recurrence of symptoms. In our case, the various topical and systemic treatments resulted in periods of remission and recurrent flares without obtaining a complete remission of the disease. In this instance, there are alternative medical treatment options to consider, including biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors like adalimumab [32] and infliximab [33], the interleukin (IL) 17A inhibitor secukinumab [34], and oral acitretin (for patients not of childbearing potential) [27]. However, these treatments were not deemed necessary in our case as the lesions were localized, and the patient was considered suitable for surgical management of the disease.
      A diverse array of surgical techniques are employed in the treatment of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. These methods can be customized based on factors such as disease stage, defect size, bacterial contamination level, anatomical location, and the consideration of scar placement and potential for revision. The most-used surgical techniques are punch debridement with a 5 to 7 mm punch biopsy instrument and surgical unroofing, which involves removal of the superficial portion of the lesion [35] followed by closure by secondary intention [36]; these techniques were also used in our case. For more severe cases, extensive excision may be necessary to address a region affected by chronic or widespread hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage III) when conservative medical and surgical interventions prove ineffective [37]. 
      In our case, the surgical intervention yielded outstanding results. At the moment, more than six months post surgical treatment, the patient remains free of any recurrence of lesions. This affirms the effectiveness of surgical methods as an impactful approach for managing moderate-stage hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage II). This strategy proves particularly advantageous for patients with inflammatory nodules and skin tunnels that do not respond to traditional topical or systemic therapies.
    
    
      4. Conclusions
      Based on a thorough case analysis, the patient under consideration exhibited no apparent common risk factors for developing HS, with the only noteworthy association being the diagnosis of ulcerative proctitis. This correlation underscores the complexity of the disease and highlights the interplay of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors in the development of this disorder. Despite being unresponsive to initial topical and systemic therapy, the patient responded remarkably well to the surgical management of the disease. The present case underlines the importance of surgical procedures in managing moderate-stage hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage II). This comprehensive exploration, spanning the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, staging, diagnosis, and most of all the surgical treatment of HS, underscores the importance of thoroughly understanding this complex condition for a more effective management strategy, especially in patients with refractory disease. As we navigate the intricacies of HS, a better patient-centered approach emerges, promising improved outcomes and enhanced quality of life for those grappling with this enigmatic condition.

Title: The Role of Microbiota in the Pathogenesis of Bullous Pemphigoid and Pemphigus Vulgaris: Evidence, Controversies, and Perspectives

Abstract: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) represent the most prevalent conditions among autoimmune bullous skin diseases, considered a major cause of severe morbidity and, in certain cases, mortality. The hallmark of the two diseases is the presence of autoantibodies directed against proteins located in the basement membrane of the skin, which determines the formation of blisters. In recent years, interest in the role of microbiota in relation to health-disease status has progressively increased. In particular, based on the gut–skin axis, accumulating evidence has emerged on the potential association between the composition and diversity of microbial communities in the gut, skin, and even in the oral cavity and the risk of developing BP and PV. Dysbiosis, characterized by a generally higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and a depletion of probiotics/beneficial species, might contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases. Despite the still limited number of studies and the need for further large-scale multicenter studies, the knowledge gathered so far is suggestive of a novel modifiable risk factor representing a potential target for adjuvant treatments of these disabling and life-threatening conditions.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Autoimmune bullous skin diseases, a major cause of severe morbidity and, in certain conditions, high mortality, embrace a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by an autoimmune response associated with loss of tolerance to skin adhesion molecules, leading to the formation of blisters and erosions in the skin and/or mucous membranes [1,2,3]. These skin disorders are classified into “pemphigoid diseases” and “pemphigus diseases” based on the level of blistering [2,3].
      Pemphigoid diseases present with subepidermal blisters and erosions resulting from the reaction of autoantibodies directed against hemidesmosomal antigens. Among pemphigoid variants, bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common form and the most frequent autoimmune blistering disease [3,4,5]. BP is a highly debilitating skin disorder that typically affects the elderly and is characterized by a distinctive eosinophilic infiltration and the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) and IgE autoantibodies to BP180 (collagen XVII) and BP230 (dystonin) [3,6,7,8,9,10]. The incidence of BP appears to be increasing over time, and estimates may greatly vary across populations, likely due to differences in underlying risk factors for BP (e.g., neurological conditions such as dementia, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke) and life expectancy [3,9,11]. Indeed, a meta-analysis published in 2022 reported a cumulative incidence of BP of 8.2 per million people and an incidence rate of 34.2 million person–years, with Europe as the largest contributor (10.3 per million people) [9]. BP negatively impacts the quality of life and has been associated with a three-fold increased risk of death within two years from diagnosis compared with matched disease-free controls [9,12]. Primary treatment of BP includes topical or systemic corticosteroids, depending on the extension of disease, combined with immunosuppressants or non-immunosuppressive agents, although other more specific immunomodulatory drugs (i.e., dimethyl fumarate) and new biological therapies are currently under investigation [13].
      Pemphigus vulgaris (PV), pemphigus foliaceous, and paraneoplastic pemphigus are considered the main forms of pemphigus diseases. A pivotal role in their pathogenesis is represented by the development of IgG autoantibodies directed against desmosomal cadherins desmoglein (Dsg)1 and Dsg3, glycoproteins involved in the cohesion between skin keratinocytes. Autoantibodies against Dsg1 and Dsg3 induce acantholysis, i.e., loss of keratinocyte cell adhesion, which determines the formation of intraepithelial flaccid blisters [2,14,15,16,17]. In addition to being considered the most serious clinical form of pemphigus, PV is also the most widespread type, accounting for approximately 70% of cases overall [14]. Despite its development at any age, with a higher frequency recorded in children and the elderly, the onset of PV generally occurs between the ages of 40 and 60 [18]. A recent meta-analysis estimated an incidence rate of 2.83 per million person–years for PV, with no significant differences by sex, and Southern Asia showed the highest rate among the subcontinents (4.94 per million person–years) [19]. While the advent of corticosteroids in the 1950s and the subsequent increasing use of adjuvant immunosuppressants have substantially reduced mortality in PV to less than 5% [15], PV remains a life-threatening disease due to complications of therapy (severe infections, cardiovascular disease, pneumonia, septicemia, malignancies) with mortality among patients that is approximately 3 times higher than that of the general population [16,19,20]. In this context, the introduction of rituximab, the monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 antigen of B lymphocytes, represents a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of PV and is currently recommended as the first line for new-onset moderate to severe forms [13].
      Human skin represents the largest epithelial surface that can act primarily as a mechanical and microbial barrier against environmental microorganisms and harmful substances, preventing potential infections and diseases [21,22,23]. Meanwhile, with an average total mucosal surface of approximately 32 m2, the adult human gastrointestinal tract hosts the highest number of microorganisms, whose abundance has been estimated from 107 in the stomach up to 1014 microbial cells per gram of content in the large intestine (vs. 1012 microbial cells located in the skin) [22,24,25]. A huge number of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and viruses, collectively known as the microbiota (microbiome instead defines the total amount of microbial genomes), inhabit the human body, and the gut microbiota, composed of over 1000 species of bacteria, exerts the most relevant functions, namely nutrient extraction, metabolic regulation, immunity, and vitamin production [26,27]. The “gut–skin axis” is a new concept referring to the dual relationship between gut microbiota and skin health [28]. Therefore, the status of intestinal dysbiosis (the disruption of the balance in terms of the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbial community, which causes the “leaky gut syndrome” and the consequent deterioration of the relationship between the microbiota and the immune system) is associated with an increased risk of irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, cardiovascular disease, central nervous system disorders, cancer, and various autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and autoimmune thyroid disease [17,29,30,31,32]. In addition, gut dysbiosis has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune dermatoses, including alopecia areata, acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis, rosacea, and vitiligo [17,23,30,33]. Several immune disorders have been linked to changes in the abundance of commensal bacteria and levels of microbiota-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) [34]. Indeed, while under physiological conditions, SCFAs communicate with the immune system and ensure immune homeostasis, perturbations of commensal gut bacteria resulting from the disruption of the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which normally functions against pathogens and segregates microbes from host cells, increase susceptibility to infections, reduces SCFA level, lead to dysregulation of immune responses, and ultimately lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance [35]. Over time, chronic intestinal dysbiosis can cause bacteria and their metabolites to cross the mucosal barrier and invade other organs, increasing the risk of various disorders [35].
      On the other hand, skin dysbiosis, resulting from the invasion of bacteria and other pathogens into the deeper skin layers or even into the systemic circulation, may lead to inflammation [32]. Importantly, the microbiota is also located in three other body districts (nasal and oral cavity, vagina), of which the oral cavity represents its second largest habitat and, as such, one of the most relevant interaction windows with the external environment [36,37]. Although the study of the oral microbiota is in its infancy, increasing evidence supports the influence of oral microbes on the development of systemic diseases by promoting an inflammatory response through oral infections or the colonization of microorganisms from the oral cavity into other organs or tissues (blood, brain, gut, heart, placenta, tumors) [37].
      Recently, based on the concept of the gut–skin axis, some observational studies have explored the potential association of gut, skin, and oral microbiota with BP and PV, speculating that they may act as additional risk factors and possible targets of new treatments for these autoimmune skin diseases (e.g., [17,38,39]). Therefore, in this comprehensive literature review, we summarized the up-to-date evidence on the relationship between microbiota and the onset of both BP and PV, discussing both promising and conflicting findings and plausible underlying biological mechanisms, thus paving the way for possible frontiers of future research.
    
    
      2. The Gut Microbiota: General Features
      The human gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic entity composed of approximately 100 trillion microorganisms, collectively weighing between 1 and 2 kg and encoding over 3 million genes, which are about 150 times the number of genes in the entire host genome [27,40,41]. Until a few decades ago, the properties and functions of the gut microbiota, as well as the host–microbiota interactions, were largely unknown due to limitations in examining non-cultivable microorganisms; however, recent advances in novel technologies such as 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing have provided an effective alternative method to microbial cultures to taxonomically characterize bacterial communities and identify the composition of the gut microbiota [42,43]. Indeed, the 16S rRNA gene encodes a highly conserved region among bacteria, which allows binding to universal primers, in addition to containing interspersed hypervariable regions that are unique to each bacterial species and thus allow their classification and characterization [40]. By targeting the 16S rRNA gene, third-generation full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing technology has enabled the identification of clusters known as Operational Taxonomic Units or Amplicon Sequence Variants, whose analysis provides information on the community diversity, richness, and evenness, as well as the degree of divergence between different sample types [44,45]. In contrast to 16S rRNA sequencing, which is a cost-effective method widely employed for characterizing the profile of complex microbial communities down to the genus level, metagenomic sequencing collects information on both the taxonomic composition and functional genes of ecosystems by sequencing the genomes of all species isolated from the entire microbial community [46,47].
      It has been estimated that up to 90% of the gut microbiota is represented by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with the Firmicutes phylum being the most abundant, comprising more than 200 different genera and composed mainly of gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Enterococcus, and Ruminococcus), while Bacteroidetes are gram-negative bacteria primarily consisting of Bacteroides and Prevotella [48,49]. On the other hand, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia represent most of the residual portion of the intestinal microbial composition [49]. It is worth noting that the composition of the intestinal microbiota changes taxonomically not only throughout the gastrointestinal tract but also with gestational age, mode of delivery, feeding methods, and antibiotic treatment [48]. Additionally, the gut microbiota profile remains relatively stable throughout adulthood, although it may be subject to variations depending on age (people over 70 years of age can be affected by problems with digestion and nutrient absorption), lifestyle (medications, smoking, physical exercise, mental health), diseases (intestinal and extra-intestinal disorders), and, mainly, diet (both habitual diet and short-term dietary changes determine variations in the composition of the gut microbiota) [41,49,50]. Conversely, variations in the gut microbiota between individuals can be attributed to differences in enterotypes (individual-specific clusters of bacteria), ethnicity, body mass index, frequency of exercise, and dietary and cultural habits [48].
      The intestinal microbiota has multiple properties, e.g., protection, metabolic activities, and regulation and development of the immune system, as described below (see also Figure 1), through which it establishes close crosstalk with the intestine, influencing the health–disease status and the subsequent functioning of all organ systems (reviewed in [27,30,51,52]).
      
        2.1. The Crosstalk Between the Gut Microbiota and Intestinal Epithelial Cells
        The gut microbiota interacts with the intestinal epithelium, which consists of different populations with specific functions: columnar cells, which participate in the digestion process; Goblet cells, producing mucus and, by presenting antigens to dendritic cells located in the lamina propria, contribute to the formation of immune tolerance; Tuft cells, which participate in the removal of parasites from the intestinal lumen by producing interleukin (IL)-25; Paneth cells that regulate microbial diversity in the intestine through the secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and growth factors; enteroendocrine cells producing peptides and hormones that stimulate peristaltic movements; microfold cells, which stimulate the immune system by binding antigens that are subsequently transported to dendritic cells; dendritic cells, which can promote an antigen-specific immune response by interacting with T cells; and B cells, which regulate the gut microbiota through IgA secretion [27,53].
        Overall, intestinal epithelium cells (IECs) form a cytoskeleton structure composed of tight and adherence junctions and desmosomes located along the lateral membrane, which confers mechanical strength between cells and ensures impermeability to the gut barrier, preventing the translocation of microorganisms from the intestinal lumen to the deep tissues [54]. Indeed, the intestinal mucus layer, which has the primary role of preserving intestinal homeostasis and whose thickness varies in the intestine (much higher in the large intestine than in the small intestine due to the density of microorganisms), is implicated in regulating the delivery of nutrients and drugs and protecting the host from mechanical attacks and food toxins [27,55]. The relationship between IECs and microbiota is bidirectional. In fact, while the microbiota contributes to the integrity of the intestinal barrier by participating in the stimulation of mucus secretion, the mucus layer, which contains mucin glycans that act as attachment sites and nutrients, represents a natural habitat for microorganisms and can also influence the composition of mucus-associated bacteria thanks to the glycosylation profile of mucin [54,55,56].
        The gut microbiota produces a series of metabolites having various functions in humans, some of which are identified as playing key roles in modulating IEC activity and preserving the gut epithelium barrier [57]. The bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers in the large intestine produces SCFAs, a group of organic compounds with less than six atoms of carbon mainly produced by Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and including acetate, propionate, and butyrate with a molar ratio of around 65, 20, and 15%, respectively [27,48,53,58]. Despite its lower abundance among SCFAs produced, butyrate is the preferred fuel source for IECs, contributing to 60–70% of their energy requirements, thereby promoting tight junction integrity, cell proliferation, and mucus secretion [59]. SCFAs amount reflects a healthy gut microbiota. Indeed, butyrate, used by colonocytes to generate energy, causes oxygen consumption that, by creating an anaerobic intestinal environment, prevents the invasion of pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella [52]. The amount of SCFAs can also control central appetite (primarily acetate), reduce weight gain (acetate and propionate), and regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis (propionate), reducing lipogenesis (acetate), and increasing the secretion of leptin (butyrate), a hormone that plays a fundamental role in energy balance and body adiposity [50,58,60].
        Together with SCFAs, gram-positive bacteria such as Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus, and gram-negative bacteria belonging to Bacteroides can synthesize secondary bile acids (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid—LCA) from primary bile acids (BAs) [27,61]. BAs such as chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid, metabolites secreted by the liver, play a primary role in the digestion and absorption of lipids and the uptake of cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins [62,63]. Approximately 95% of BAs are reabsorbed by IECs and then excreted in the feces through deconjugation, dihydroxylation, and oxidation, while unabsorbed bile acids act as substrates for gut microbial metabolism [27,57,62,63].
        Recently, the gut microbiota has also emerged as a master regulator of tryptophan metabolism, an essential amino acid that is metabolized through three major pathways: (i) primarily through the kynurenine pathway, leading to the generation of kynurenine and other related compounds; (ii) conversion, to a lesser extent, into various indole derivatives; and (iii) the serotonin pathway for the synthesis of serotonin and melatonin [26]. Tryptophan-derived gut metabolites contribute to the maintenance of the gut barrier, while recent evidence indicates that, like butyrate, indole activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in IECs, leading to the enhancement of tight junctions [64,65]. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter primarily synthesized in the enterochromaffin cells (a subtype of enteroendocrine cells) of the gut, has also been reported to modulate gut microbiota composition [66]. At the same time, serotonin synthesis is, in turn, regulated by the relative levels of SCFAs, particularly butyrate [67].
      
      
        2.2. Interaction Between the Gut Microbiota and Immunity
        The gut microbiota establishes a close dual interplay with the innate immune system, and since this interaction is highly complex and dynamic, any perturbation in the composition of the gut microbiota or host–microbiota interfaces or dyshomeostasis in the immune system can potentially cause systemic dissemination of commensal microorganisms, increased susceptibility to infections, and an exaggerated immune response [68]. AMPs, a class of diverse compounds produced by Paneth cells and immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract, are key effectors of innate immunity, playing crucial roles both in the host defense against enteric infections and in the maintenance of immune tolerance to the gut microbiota [69]. While SCFAs regulate AMP expression, AMPs can modulate the composition of the gut microbiota, preserving species–specific bacterial communities [69,70]. Furthermore, Paneth cells, through the production of AMPs, promote the regeneration of RegIIIγ, a secreted antibacterial lectin, and the consequent segregation of the microbiota and IECs, avoiding potentially harmful and unnecessary immune responses [57,71]. SCFAs exert their effects on both the epithelial barrier function as well as on mucosal and systemic immunity through the direct inhibition of histone deacetylases, a class of enzymes capable of removing acetyl groups from histones and other protein regulatory factors [34,72]. SCFAs may also activate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A, which belong to one of the largest families of proteins that feature a conserved structure composed of seven transmembrane helices [34,52]. In particular, GPCR43 is a major target of SCFAs for the regulation of the immune system and control of inflammation, helping to prevent the development of various chronic inflammatory diseases [73].
        Gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT), which histologically embrace the appendix, crypt patches, isolated lymphoid follicles, mesenteric lymph nodes, and Peyer’s patches, represent the critical link between the non-specific immune response to the gut microbiota and the subsequent adaptive immune response, thus playing a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis between gut microorganisms and the immune system [51]. GALT is based on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on enteric bacteria via various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (located on the cell membrane and able to recognize exogenous PAMPs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) (cytosolic receptors specialized in defense against intracellular pathogens), and the activation of a downstream signaling cascade, which in turn leads to the secretion of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18) and chemokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha—TNF-α, CXCL8, and CCL10) [27,51,68,74]. Like AMPs in the small intestine, this mechanism serves as a major regulator of the microbiota in the large intestine [27]. TLRs, and in particular TLR5, in addition to being involved in host defense against pathogens, regulate the abundance of commensal microbes, while, conversely, TLR5 deletion causes microbial dysbiosis [75]. Similarly, myeloid differentiation primary response gene-88 (MyD88), an adapter protein localized on TLRs, regulates T cell differentiation and also promotes microbial homeostasis by stimulating IgA secretion, while its suppression is associated with an altered microbial composition [74,76].
        Notably, some NLRs give rise to multiprotein complexes known as inflammasomes, which, through cleavage and activation of caspase-1, lead to the activation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 in mature forms that, in turn, preserve the homeostasis of the gut microbiota [77]. NOD-pyrin domain-containing 6 (NLRP6), in particular, has been associated with the modulation of colonic microbial ecology and intestinal balance [68,78].
        Dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages, other key effectors in the innate immune response and distributed within the epithelium and intraepithelial layers, lamina propria, and structures of GALT, exert crucial functions of phagocytosis and antigen presentation to the adaptive immune system and are also involved in maintaining immune tolerance to commensal bacteria [51]. On the other hand, SCFAs can promote hematopoiesis of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and polarize macrophages through epigenetic modulation, as well as trigger different local immune responses of dendritic cells [51]. In the context of anti-inflammatory properties, SCFAs can also increase the production of antimicrobial peptides (e.g., calprotectin) by macrophages and regulate the chemotactic recruitment of neutrophils through both inhibition of HDAC activity and GPR43 signaling [34].
        Although less explored until recent years, accumulating evidence suggests the existence of a mutualistic relationship also between the intestinal microbiota and the adaptive immune system. Indeed, B cells produce a large array of IgA antibodies responsive to commensals [68], while the gut microbiota and SCFAs induce B cell differentiation and intestinal IgA secretion [34]. SCFAs also induce differentiation of T regulatory cells via both HDAC inhibition and the GPR43 pathway [34]. In particular, butyrate favors the differentiation of naïve T cells to effectors such as T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells, subsets of CD4+ regulatory T cells that, by releasing cytokines like IL-2, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), promote the survival, differentiation, and antitumor activities of CD8+ cytotoxic cells, the most powerful effectors against intracellular pathogens and cancerous cells [68,79,80]. Additionally, SCFAs have anti-inflammatory effects by influencing cytokine expression in T cells [34]. Butyrate induces the upregulation of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta and suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, through the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), a transcription factor involved in the regulation of immune responses, inflammation, cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis [81,82].
      
    
    
      3. The Gut–Skin Axis
      Based on growing evidence suggesting that alterations in the gut microbiota may promote the development of diseases outside the gastrointestinal tract, including atherosclerosis, cardiometabolic diseases, hypertension, chronic kidney diseases, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and even inflammatory skin disorders, the concept of a gut–skin axis has also been postulated [25,83,84]. The gut microbiota composition appears to be associated with the development of psoriatic disease, with an increased F/B ratio, which could reflect the association of psoriasis with metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities [85]. A non-negligible number of immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis and pyoderma gangrenosum, are more frequently diagnosed among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, a group of disorders represented mainly by ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, which result from interactions between genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, and lifestyle/dietary factors [86,87]. Furthermore, atopic dermatitis has been associated with intestinal dysbiosis characterized by reduced microbial diversity and a decrease in commensal microbes like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which leads to an enhanced inflammatory response in the skin [88]. Likewise, in acne, a decrease in Cutibacterium in the skin is concurrent with reduced microbial diversity in the gut, which in turn may worsen the clinical severity of the cutaneous disease [88]. The connection between the skin and the gut appears to be mediated by the activities of immunological components and inflammatory mediators located between the two districts, as well as by neuroendocrine signaling [30,88]. While the microbiota is a key modulator of the immune system, the presence of pathogens or other host-specific factors (lifestyle, diet, antibiotics) can influence the composition and function of the gut microbiota by activating the immune system, thus leading to a decrease in the diversity of the microbial community, a loss of commensals, or an overgrowth of harmful microorganisms [22,30,89]. A decrease in SFCA producers caused by dysbiosis results in a proinflammatory state of the gut that affects the production of the mucus layer [30,84]. The increased permeability of the gut barrier facilitates the passage of microorganisms, together with their toxic metabolites and neurotransmitters, into the circulatory system and then into a variety of organs, including the skin [30,90] (Figure 2). In fact, SCFAs are believed to influence the predominance of certain skin microbiotic profiles, which subsequently induce cutaneous immune responses [90]. Furthermore, reduced diversity and richness of the gut microbiota, such as those that occur following a high-fat, low-fiber “Western diet”, are often related to alterations in the composition of the secondary BA pool that participates in the enterohepatic cycle and is involved in the immune–inflammatory response [91,92,93]. Thus, while at relatively low concentrations (e.g., <50 μM) secondary, BAs exert anti-inflammatory actions by primarily binding to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5) in various organs, higher concentrations of these molecules (up to 1 mM) lead to detrimental effects on the intestinal epithelium, activating the NF-κB and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 signaling pathways (cascades regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, metabolism, and survival) and inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species, mutations, DNA damage, and apoptosis [61,94,95]. Patients with rosacea present an increase in circulating secondary BAs, particularly LCA, which, by activating the expression of TGR5 in keratinocytes, promotes the production of cytokines and chemokines [92].
      Similarly, diet, gut dysbiosis, or changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota (i.e., a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes—F/B ratio, recognized as a marker of normal/compromised intestinal homeostasis [96]) or damage to the intestinal barrier may lead to increased levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), synthesized in the liver from trimethylamine, a molecule resulting from the metabolism of phosphatidylcholine/choline, carnitine, betaine, dimethylglycine, and ergothioneine contained in dietary compounds, and mainly produced in the colon by Clostridia, Shigella, Proteus, and Aerobacter [97,98]. An increase in circulating TMAO triggers the activation of the NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome, which plays a complex role in the innate immune response and inflammatory signaling [99]), upregulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and chemokines, and induces oxidative stress [100]. TMAO is indeed considered a marker of bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation and a prognostic factor for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, recurrent ischemic events), metabolic syndrome, renal failure, and inflammatory skin diseases such as hidradenitis suppurativa, an auto-inflammatory skin disease generally associated with cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities [83,101,102,103].
      Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota causes alterations in the relationship between microbial tryptophan metabolism and the host intestinal immune system, resulting in dysregulation of kynurenine and serotonin pathways [26]. Disruption of tryptophan catabolism pathways may ultimately contribute to the development of inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular comorbidities, kidney disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, and cancer [26,104]. Although with conflicting results, levels of metabolites and enzymes of the kynurenine pathway are positively associated with psoriasis, probably due to an increased production of cytokines IL-17 and IL-22, leading to skin proliferation and development of psoriatic lesions [104].
      Disturbances in gut microbiota diversity also affect the production of neurotransmitters (e.g., γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline) [30]. Altered levels of neurotransmitters, in addition to being linked to a broad spectrum of immune-related neurological disorders, including developmental and psychiatric diseases and neurodegeneration, may also adversely influence the physiological functioning of the skin via the nervous system [30,105,106]. Indeed, binding of neurotransmitters to receptors expressed on immune cells located in the dermis and epidermis modulates the immune system response, promoting an inflammatory process characterized by differentiation of Th17 cells and secretion of proinflammatory molecules (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-23, IFN-γ, TNF-α), cell migration, vascular permeability, and mast cell degranulation, which ultimately may result in the onset of skin diseases, such as psoriasis [84,107,108].
      Free phenol and p-cresol metabolites of aromatic amino acids produced by certain pathogenic bacteria like Clostridium difficile in conditions of disturbed gut environment may enter the circulation and accumulate in the skin, where in vitro, they reduce the production of keratin, thereby affecting epidermal differentiation and skin barrier integrity [90,109]. A positive association of cresol levels with skin dryness and disruption of keratinization was also reported in adult women, where the daily use of prebiotics and probiotics reduced serum total phenol levels and restored healthy skin [110].
      Finally, excessive production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), recognized as a gaseous signaling molecule having anti-inflammatory functions at physiological levels, can negatively affect the intestinal mucosa, leading to alterations of the relative abundance, functions, and spatial organization of intestinal bacteria and disruption of mucus integrity through the breaking of mucus disulfide bonds [111,112]. H2S is produced from sulfur-containing dietary amino acids (e.g., cysteine, methionine, taurine) by sulfate-reducing bacteria in the gut and achieves its highest concentration in the colon (250 mM) [113,114]. Most of the effects of H2S are highly concentration-dependent, and while in normal skin conditions, it regulates vasodilatation and apoptosis, promotes keratinocyte differentiation, modulates pruritus, and suppresses inflammation, alterations in H2S production, induces the production of proinflammatory mediators and leukocyte activation, contributing to the pathogenesis of some skin disorders (psoriasis, melanoma, and other dermatoses) [115].
      Although the association between gut and skin microbial communities is an emergent area of research and the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota interfere with skin balance remain to be fully elucidated, current data on potential biological drivers involved in the gut–skin axis as well as skin disease risk (represented in Figure 2) indicate the direction for future studies to further investigate this relationship in order to promote both gut and skin health.
    
    
      4. The Gut Microbiota and the Relationship with Autoimmune Bullous Diseases
      As described in the previous section, gut microbiota dysbiosis can induce both local and systemic immune responses, thus potentially contributing to the development of autoimmune diseases, which, in addition to being considered among the major causes of morbidity and mortality, are collectively characterized by long-lasting debilitating symptoms, organ impairment, and high treatment costs [86,116,117]. The burden of BP and PV is substantial due to a variety of comorbidities due to viral and bacterial infections or long-term corticosteroid use, which result in high rates of hospitalization and increased risk of mortality [118,119]. Therefore, a deeper understanding of modifiable risk factors, including the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota, can help in discovering more effective and targeted treatments to improve the quality of life of patients with debilitating diseases.
      
        4.1. The Association of the Gut Microbiota with Bullous Pemphigoid
        The pathophysiological hallmark of BP is the production of autoantibodies directed against two structural components of hemidesmosomes (a highly specialized multiprotein complex that ensures firm adhesion between basal epithelial cells and the dermal extracellular matrix), BP230 and BP180 [120,121]. While genetic variations in the human leukocyte antigen system (encoding proteins involved in immune regulation) have been established as the most significant predisposing factors in BP, contributing to the loss of immune tolerance towards the two hemidesmosomal anchoring proteins, the imbalance between Th and Treg cells, the activation of toll-like receptors and of Th2- and Th17-related cytokines cascades, the latter maintaining the inflammatory response by inducing cytokine production, are responsible for antibody secretion in BP [4,121,122,123].
        To date, four studies have examined the gut microbiota’s impact on the development of BP (Table 1). The pilot study by Scaglione et al. [38] reported an underrepresentation of Proteobacteria in the gut microbiota of BP patients, with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as the most abundant phyla, reflecting a similar composition to that of healthy subjects and with no significant differences from PV patients. In the study by Liu et al. [10], who recruited 66 pairs of BP patients and their controls matched for age, sex, and study center, participants were further sub-grouped by patients’ disease status (first diagnoses and relapsed cases) to assess the relationship between gut dysbiosis and BP disease activity. The authors observed both decreased richness and evenness as well as alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota in BP patients [10]. An enrichment of Flavonifractor and Flavonifractor plautii was detected in BP patients and relapsed cases, respectively, supporting the hypothesis that these microbial species can be associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, probably due to their ability to degrade beneficial anticarcinogenic flavonoids [10,124]. However, the enterobacterium Flavonifractor plautii can also abolish antigen-induced Th2 immune responses and attenuate inflammation by suppressing TNF-α expression and IL-17 signaling in the adipose tissues and intestine, respectively, leaving doubts about its real function [125,126,127]. In contrast, BP patients exhibited a reduced abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a well-known butyrate-producing bacterium belonging to Firmicutes, which, thanks to the properties of its metabolites butyrate and salicylic acid, can inhibit IL-8 production by suppressing the NF-kB pathway, upregulate Treg cell production, and induce IL-10 secretion, thus blocking the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12 and, in general, inflammatory processes [128,129]. Lower amounts of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were observed in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease [130,131] and psoriasis [84], while Faecalibacterium prausnitzii as a probiotic supplement can be used in the prevention and management of colorectal cancer [132] and type 2 diabetes [133]. Furthermore, shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome revealed significant alterations in twelve gut microbiota pathways in BP patients, nine of which were significantly increased, i.e., those related to pyridoxal 5′-phosphate biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and biotin biosynthesis [10]. Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate acts as a cofactor of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in the conversion of L-glutamate into GABA, a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter that is also a signaling molecule produced by bacteria, fungi, plants, and invertebrates [134]. The authors identified in BP patients both the GABA shotgun, a three-step pathway that provides an alternative route for the synthesis of succinate from α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondrial-based tricarboxylic acid cycle for subsequent bacterial energy production, and the biosynthesis of putrescin, which, like ornithine and arginine, is an alternative precursor of GABA [134,135]. Putrescine, a major metabolite of gut bacteria that can promote a “leaky gut” condition during both intestinal autoinflammation and infection [136], is positively correlated with the expression of inflammatory chemokines in patients with psoriasis [137]. Additionally, putrescine, being involved in several cellular processes (proliferation, stress protection, metabolism, and regulation of the immune response), like other polyamines, if dysregulated, can impact growth, aging, and diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration [138,139]. Although the reported biological activities of GABA include alleviation of pruritus, attenuation of atopic dermatitis lesions by promoting Th1 response, increased expression of type 1 collagen, and maintenance of skin elasticity, the GABA shunt appears to play a key role in BP, consistent with the significantly positive association of GABA biosynthesis from putrescine with atopic dermatitis severity [25,30,134,140]. These inconsistent results could be attributed to differences in the components and activities of GABA shunt bacterial species even within the same genus, with some bacteria containing multiple GAD enzymes and others containing no GAD homologs at all [10,140]. Another Chinese study [39] recruiting consecutive patients diagnosed with BP, further divided into those in the active stage and in the remission stage, documented an increased trend of alpha diversity (a score referring to the species richness or evenness within a functional community [141]) in patients with BP onset compared with the control group, unlike the study of Liu et al. [10]. This finding could be explained by the enrichment of pathogenic bacteria in patients with active BP, namely Bacteroidaceae and Ruminococcaceae, and the reduced relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae compared with healthy controls [39]. Ruminococcaceae, among the most widespread families of Firmicutes, is one of the few taxa that include secondary BA producers, known to cause pro-inflammatory effects [142], although its relationship with immune-mediated diseases is somewhat controversial, with a low relative abundance associated with inflammatory bowel disease [143] and immunoglobulin E-associated eczema [144] and higher relative abundance correlated with asthma [145] and reactive arthritis [146]. Conversely, members of Lachnospiraceae, including Blautia, Coprococcus, Lachnospira, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, are massive producers of SCFAs and, as such, may alleviate inflammatory and allergic diseases by exerting anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [147,148]. Therefore, reduced levels of Lachnospiraceae can lead to an imbalance in the functionality of the gut microbiota, resulting in an increased risk of inflammatory skin diseases such as alopecia areata [149], hidradenitis suppurativa [150], and PV [151]. Patients with active BP also showed a reduced proportion of Prevotellaceae but a higher proportion of Prevoltella copri [39]. Relative abundance of Prevotellaceae is linked to the dietary habits of rural and preagricultural or isolated populations, and if it may improve cardiovascular risk and glucose metabolism [151], it also includes strains such as Prevotella copri, a frequent inhabitant of the gut microbiota, which also shows pathobiontic properties such as releasing inflammatory mediators [152,153]. Prevotella copri is, in fact, associated with both inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis [154], human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection [155], insulin resistance [156], ankylosing spondylitis [157], and metabolic benefits by improving glycemic control [158], depending on dietary habits [159,160,161]. Active disease subjects were also characterized by a depletion of Vellonella dispar, a Gram-negative commensal bacterium that produces SCFAs by lactate fermentation [162], and Bacteroides ovatus, a commensal microbe that, due to its ability to consume a variety of food sources, colonizes the intestine, helping to prevent pathogen invasion and related inflammation [163]. Furthermore, some species shared significant correlations with clinical parameters [39]. Notably, the composition of the gut microbiota in BP patients in remission resembled that of the control group, indicating that the treatment can reduce harmful bacteria that cause inflammation, further emphasizing the involvement of intestinal microbial communities in disease development [39]. In assessing the gut microbiota profile in BP patients, Han and coauthors [164] found a higher relative abundance of pathogens and a reduction in probiotics in affected subjects, who exhibited a significant difference in beta diversity (an index describing the amount of overlap or differentiation between species communities [141]) compared with controls and an overall worse dysbiosis than that observed in PV patients. More specifically, subjects with BP presented an enrichment of Proteobacteria, although the predominance of this phylum was less evident than in PV patients, as previously observed by Scaglione et al. [38]. Furthermore, in line with the above-mentioned findings [10,39], the authors observed an increased abundance of Bacteroides and Prevotella and a reduction in Faecalibacterium, the latter being strictly and negatively correlated with autoantibody titer [164]. Functional analysis revealed significantly increased alterations in BP patients compared with PV patients in certain microbial pathways, i.e., Escherichia coli infection, shigellosis, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, and biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a vital cell wall constituent of Gram-negative bacteria that can directly modulate the immune system by inducing cytokine production [165]), suggesting a different role of gut microbiota in bullous diseases [164].
        In summary, despite the limited number of investigations, the small sample size, and the lack of longitudinal data that generally characterize the studies analyzed, as well as the presence of only one study using shotgun metagenomic sequencing to explore gut microbiota function in BP, there are signals of association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and BP pathogenesis, with alterations in relative abundance in certain identified taxa (i.e., drop in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, increase in Prevotella copri) and metabolic routes (i.e., GABA shunt and related pathways and functional and inflammatory pathways) potentially involved in the inflammation process within the gut–skin axis. Furthermore, the different profiles of the intestinal microbiota at different stages of the disease suggest the possibility of supplementation with prebiotics, probiotics, and symbiotics to improve intestinal microbiota homeostasis, preserve the integrity of the intestinal barrier, regulate the immune response, and facilitate disease remission.
      
      
        4.2. The Association of the Gut Microbiota with Pemphigus Vulgaris
        PV is an autoimmune disease characterized primarily by the presence of IgG antibodies against Dsg1 and Dsg3 due to the involvement of immune responses mediated by B cells (crucial to producing specific autoantibodies) and T cells (participating in the onset and persistence of PV) [153,166]. In particular, Th1 and Th17 appear to play a predominant role in PV pathogenesis, with PV patients exhibiting higher levels of inflammatory Th1 (IL-1RA, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12p70, GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-18) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17, IL-22, IL-23) than healthy controls [166,167].
        In recent years, a few studies have explored the association between gut microbiota status and PV (Table 2). In an Italian pilot study aimed at evaluating potential microbial alterations in the gut, skin, and oral cavity of PV subjects, gut microbiota analysis revealed a similar composition at the phylum level to that of healthy subjects, with Firmicutes showing the highest relative abundance, followed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria [38]. Huang et al. [153] first compared gut microbiota in PV patients and healthy controls also with regard to circulating cytokines of Th1/Th2/Th17 cells. Although the two groups showed no significant differences in alpha diversity, analysis of beta diversity revealed that, at the genus level, PV patients had reduced levels of Lachnospiracea_incertae_sedis and Coprococcus, whose decline in the gut microbiota leads to reduced production of SCFAs and has been related to the development of allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic disorders, and mental and neuropsychological disorders [137,153,168,169,170]. The case group was characterized by increased levels of Granulicatella and Flavonifractor, the latter not only linked to different conditions such as affective disorders and colorectal cancer but also associated with oxidative stress and increased inflammation, and whose higher relative abundance was also observed in BP patients [10,153,171,172]. Consistently, Huang and coworkers [153] found that Flavonifractor was positively correlated with circulating levels of C5a, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, and IL-21, while Lachnospiracea_incertae_sedis and Coprococcus were both negatively associated with IL-17A, indicating that changes in the gut microbiota may induce an unbalanced Th1/Th2 or Th17/Treg differentiation and related abnormal cytokine production, typical of PV. Guo et al. [173] reported that the gut microbiota of patients with PV had lower diversity and richness than those of healthy controls, and the two microbial communities showed a significant degree of dissimilarity. Indeed, although the F/B ratio was not significantly different between the two groups, the gut microbiota of PV patients presented an increased abundance of Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia and a depletion of Firmicutes, which include producers of SCFAs such as Lactobacillaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae [52,173]. Consequently, the abundance of bacteria like Butyricicoccus, Clostridium, Megamonas, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Lactobacillus murinus was significantly reduced in these subjects [173]. In contrast, pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Shigella pneumoniae were considerably enriched in patients with PV and also showed internal positive correlations, thus resulting in increased biosynthesis of LPS [173]. These opportunistic bacteria were also positively associated with anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg3 antibody levels and with the Pemphigus Disease Area Index, a validated score used to assess the severity of PV [173,174]. Additionally, metabolomic analysis on stool samples revealed abnormal accumulation of lipids and lipid compounds, especially phosphatidylethanolamine, the second most abundant class of glycerophospholipids whose metabolism dysregulation can promote inflammasome activation and contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory diseases [173,175,176]. Of note, phosphatidylethanolamine content was positively correlated with Streptococcus parasanguinis and Klebsiella pneumoniae and negatively correlated with Roseburia spp., suggesting the potential involvement of these microbial species and their metabolites in the pathogenesis and progression of PV [173]. Another case-control study documented significant differences in the composition, but not in the richness, of the gut microbiota species in PV patients compared with healthy family members [117]. In particular, the cases exhibited an enrichment of Escherichia coli, which, being a Gram-negative bacterium, is coated with LPS and therefore able to induce an inflammatory response and, by creating a “leaky gut”, to trigger the onset of autoimmune diseases [117,177]. These subjects also had a concomitant decrease in the relative abundance of probiotics and certain SCFA-producing species, which is likely attributable to the inhibitory action of Escherichia coli via the production of toxins and enterobactin (the latter a conserved siderophore that chelates iron from iron-binding host proteins, suppressing the growth of other bacteria [178]). Escherichia coli may also exacerbate inflammation and disease progression due to the lower levels of SCFAs found in PV patients, although they were partially restored after one month of glucocorticoid therapy [117]. Although glucocorticoid treatment did not significantly change alpha and beta diversity in PV patients, it caused a decrease in the relative abundance of Escherichia coli in responders, indicating that this therapy may help restore intestinal homeostasis [117]. In PV patients, Escherichia coli displayed a strong correlation with the phosphotransferase system pathway, a conserved cascade involved in the transport and phosphorylation of selected carbohydrates as well as in the virulence of several pathogenic bacterial species, suggesting that this pathway, enriched in these patients, may contribute to the toxic effects of Escherichia coli [117,179]. Confirming previous results, Li et al. [17] observed no significant differences in alpha diversity of the gut microbiota when comparing patients with pemphigus in an active stage (75% of whom had PV), patients with pemphigus in remission stage characterized by the absence of new lesions (63.7% of them had PV), and healthy controls. The authors also found no significant alterations in the composition of the microbial communities between the three groups, in line with the study by Wang et al. [117]. Conversely, the relative abundance of gut microbiota taxa in pemphigus patients was altered compared with controls [17]. Indeed, the active pemphigus group presented an enrichment of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and a depletion of Firmicutes, with a slight decrease in the F/B ratio and a significantly higher proportion of pathogenic bacteria than the pemphigus remission group, as previously reported by Guo et al. [173], supporting the involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in pemphigus development [17]. Furthermore, specific taxa were correlated with autoantibody titers. In particular, Veillonella, which has been reported to reduce the risk of asthma and bronchiolitis by inducing a mixed Th1/Th2/Th17 lung inflammatory response [180,181], was depleted among patients with active pemphigus, thus explaining the observed inverse correlation with anti-Dsg3 antibody titers [17]. In contrast, the abundance of Prevotella, which was lower in these patients than in the other groups, as observed in subjects affected by BP [39], was positively associated with anti-Dsg1 antibody titers [17]. The effects of the Prevotella genus (members of which are anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria of the Bacteroidetes phylum) on the host are still debated [166]. As discussed in Section 4.1, Prevotella strains are generally considered commensal bacteria, with increased abundance (linked to a diet rich in non-starch polysaccharides, resistant starch, and fiber content) associated with improved glucose metabolism [159,182] but in a state of dysbiosis they may cause localized infections and inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis due to the production of virulence factors (e.g., LPS, hemolysins adhesins, proteases), which enhance the proliferation and survival of microorganisms [183]. Coriobacteriaceae that, as SCFA producers, contribute to the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota, preserving the integrity of the intestinal barrier and regulating the immune system, but, when increased, affect immune reconstitution [184,185], were positively associated with anti-Dsg1 autoantibody titers [17]. Of interest, Faecalibacterium, known to exert anti-inflammatory actions through the production of butyrate [186], was also depleted in patients with autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus) [187] and positively associated with both anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg3 antibody titers in patients with active pemphigus [17]. Finally, research by Han et al. [164] explored differences in gut microbiota composition in different bullous diseases. Regarding PV, patients were characterized by an enrichment of Proteobacteria compared with healthy controls [164]. This is a signature of gut dysbiosis, given the generally low prevalence of this phylum within a balanced gut microbial community [188]. An increased abundance of Proteobacteria has, in fact, been associated with low-grade inflammatory conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome [189], obesity and metabolic disorders [190], and with severe intestinal inflammatory disorders including inflammatory bowel disease [191] and colorectal cancer [192]. Furthermore, consistent with Guo et al. [173], Enterobacter spp., which behaves as both facultative anaerobic Gram-negative natural commensals and opportunistic pathogens (behavior observed for Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter hormaechei), were positively associated with Dsg3 autoantibodies, thus representing potential inducers of PV [148].
        Overall, although the data provided so far are limited, a fair amount of evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota of PV patients enriched in pathogenic and/or opportunistic bacteria (e.g., Flavonifractor, Enterobacter, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis) and with a lower relative abundance of probiotics (e.g., Lachnospiracea_incertae_sedis, Coprococcus, Veillonella), might be involved in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. However, the inconclusive results on associations between specific taxa and PV autoantibodies reflect the limitations of these studies, which are all based on a cross-sectional design and rely on too small numbers of subjects, and at the same time, they are often difficult to compare due to differences in sequencing methods and depths. Future multicenter research is desirable to increase statistical power together with experimental studies to confirm the role of microbial species in disease development and also to clarify all the underlying mechanisms involved in this relationship.
      
    
    
      5. The Oral Microbiota and the Relationship with the Health-Disease Status
      The oral cavity, a complex system of microbial habitats (buccal mucosa, teeth, gingival sulcus, hard and soft palate, tongue, and tonsils), hosts a multitude of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, among which bacteria represent the main components with over 700 species for a total of 150 genera and seven phyla (Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and TM7), making this microbial community the second largest after that of the gastrointestinal tract [193,194,195]. Unlike the gut microbiota, which can profoundly modify its composition based on changes in diet and local environment, the oral microbiota remains largely stable over time with no significant differences even between individuals, except for differences in relative abundance between taxa and at the strain level [193,194].
      Growing evidence indicates that, in addition to covering a critical role in oral health by increasing the risk of oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancer, the oral microbiota is also linked to a variety of extraoral conditions, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, hepatitis, colon, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, low birth weight, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease [37,193,194,196]. In fact, despite the still limited data, it has become clear that oral health, which can be profoundly affected by poor oral hygiene behaviors, can impact human health through an inflammatory response caused by a localized infection like gingivitis and mucosal inflammation or, alternatively, by the ectopic invasion of oral microorganisms (e.g., Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis) into other organs [37,195,197]. Dysbiosis in the oral cavity creates an inflammatory microenvironment containing elevated levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-2 IL-8, TNF-α, and prostaglandins), which can be released into the circulatory system and contribute to systemic inflammation [197].
      Among chronic inflammatory cutaneous diseases, psoriasis is strongly associated with periodontal disease. In fact, psoriatic patients suffer from worse periodontal health (more severe gingival inflammation, alveolar bone loss, and fewer remaining teeth) compared with subjects without psoriasis [197,198]. A recent study also found that subjects with alterations in the oral microflora, i.e., reduced levels of Prevotella and higher relative abundance of Corynebacterium, are more likely to experience a psoriasis exacerbation, suggesting a direct contribution of the oral microbiota, rather than the severity of gingivitis, to the disease pathogenesis [196].
      
        The Association of the Oral Microbiota with Pemphigus Vulgaris
        While the association between the oral microbiota and BP remains unexplored to date, two investigations have explored the oral microbiota profile in PV patients (Table 3). The first, which evaluated the composition of the microbiota in three different districts of patients affected by PV, highlighted how their oral mucosa was characterized by the greatest diversity, with Firmicutes as the most abundant phylum, followed, in decreasing proportions, by Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria [38]. Comparison with a selected reference control group revealed a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the oral mucosa of PV patients, which could explain the typical intraoral halitosis resulting from the decomposition of sulfur-containing amino acids by anaerobic bacteria observed in these subjects [38,199]. The second study, aimed at assessing the composition of the oral microbiota in PV patients with oral lesions and healthy individuals, found a total of nine phyla in all cases and controls, and Firmicutes was confirmed as the most represented phylum in both groups, followed by Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria, although with a significant dominance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria in patients compared with healthy controls [200]. Despite the lack of substantial differences in the alpha diversity index, the significantly increased number of genera observed in patients might depend on insufficient oral hygiene due to the presence of painful lesions, which represent one of the early manifestations in 50% of PV subjects before manifesting as skin blisters [200,201]. On the other hand, the beta diversity analysis revealed a higher abundance of Parvimonas micra and Fusobacterium nucleatum in patients compared with controls [200]. Parvimonas micra, a gram-positive obligate anaerobe and a common constituent of the commensal flora in the gastrointestinal tract, has been identified as a major oral pathogen associated with endoperiodontal lesions and periodontitis, as well as among the most common species contributing to a variety of infections, systemic abscesses, and some malignancies [202,203,204,205]. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a gram-negative anaerobic opportunistic pathogen that promotes colonization and adherence to oral biofilms by almost all bacterial species, thus participating in the production of volatile sulfur compounds, and oral plaque formation, is also crucially involved in the development of periodontitis, extraoral infections and abscesses, colorectal cancer, and, with less evidence, oral squamous cell carcinoma [206,207,208,209]. The dominance of these two species, along with the depletion of Streptococcus salivarius, which appears to inhibit the growth of periodontal pathogens contributing to the balance of the oral microbiota, may explain the unpleasant odor of PV subjects [200,210].
        While collectively, oral microbiota composition does not appear to be associated with PV, which also raises the question of whether dysbiosis status in the oral cavity is the cause or consequence of autoimmune bullous diseases, the higher relative abundance of oral Firmicutes in these patients suggests a possible role of this phylum in the PV pathogenesis. At the same time, the substantial reduction of Bacteroidetes and the abundance of anaerobic species associated with inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis, can account for the distinct malodor typical of PV patients.
      
    
    
      6. The Skin Microbiota and the Relationship with the Health–Disease Status
      Human skin, with a surface of approximately 1.8 m2, is the largest and the most exposed organ of the body, serving both as a physical barrier against foreign pathogens and as a niche capable of providing a milieu for a myriad of commensals, with a total of 1 million resident bacteria per cm2 [211,212]. Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes are the four dominant bacterial phyla in the skin, with variations in microbial composition dictated by topography, whereby different regions characterized by specific pH, temperature, moisture, and sebum content influence microbial community structures [213,214]. Like the gut microbiota, the skin microflora represents a dynamic system, subject to two significant changes, the first one occurring after birth and the latter happening at the adolescence stage when sexual maturation promotes the proliferation of lipophilic bacteria, while other small changes are due to alterations in host biology and environmental exposures (skin care products, antibiotics) throughout life [211].
      Despite the recent interest in the skin microbiota, it has been established to play a key role in maintaining healthy skin conditions through modulation of the immune system, inhibition of pathogenic bacteria growth, synthesis of vitamins and amino acids, and regulation of epidermal differentiation [211,214]. Epidermal keratinocytes produce AMPs (mostly represented by peptides such as β-defensin 2 and cathelicidin) that can be constitutively expressed or, alternatively, regulated by the complement C5a receptor, which also modulates the expression of pattern recognition receptors, proinflammatory mediators, and possibly the skin microbiota [215]. On the other hand, a disequilibrium in the composition of the microbial community, leading to epithelial barrier breakdown, increased pathogens colonization concomitant with depletion of beneficial commensals, and ultimately immune dysregulation and inflammatory response, has been associated with the onset of antigen-driven disorders including acne vulgaris (imbalance between the status of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis [216]); psoriasis (increased proportions of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and reduction of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus epidermidis [85,217,218]); atopic dermatitis (overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus [219]); and rosacea (higher relative abundance of Staphylococcus, Cutibacterium, Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, Acinetobacter, Snodgrasella, Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii, Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis [220,221,222]). Nonetheless, it is currently unclear whether inflammatory skin diseases are the result of disturbances in the skin microbiota or whether they themselves promote this change [214,223]. Importantly, in immunosuppressed hosts, certain species such as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Malassezia, Cutibacterium acne, and Roseomonas mucosa can cause systemic diseases when they penetrate deeper tissue, giving rise to bacteremia, chronic wounds, osteomyelitis, and/or surgical site soft tissue infections [224].
      
        The Association of the Skin Microbiota with Bullous Pemphigoid and Pemphigus Vulgaris
        So far, the relationship between skin microbial communities and autoimmune blistering diseases has been investigated in three studies (Table 4). In the first, a comparison of the skin microbiota in BP patients and matched controls across multiple sites documented no significant differences in the alpha diversity, in agreement with most studies evaluating this index for the gut and oral microbiota (see previous sections) [5]. Conversely, beta diversity significantly differed between patients and controls in perilesional sites (areas adjacent to a fresh blister of erosion) as well as between perilesional and non-lesional sites (contralateral to the perilesional site) within patients, indicating that this parameter changed depending on the disease status and the associated cutaneous microbiota [5]. Perilesional sites in BP patients had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and Staphylococcus [5], which, in Staphylococcus aureus, is associated with atopic dermatitis that, like BP, shares various characteristics, including itch, increased levels of eosinophils, and elevated amounts of IgG autoantibodies [6,225,226,227,228]. Scaglione et al. [38] recruited patients with PV or BP and assessed the composition of the skin lesion microbiota, finding that Firmicutes was the most represented phylum in both patient groups, while the genus Staphylococcus was confirmed as the most abundant in the two groups. In contrast to the study by Miodovnik et al. [5], who reported a higher relative abundance of Staphylococcus epidermis, an opportunistic pathogen in the context of immunosuppression, the authors identified Staphylococcus aureus as the most abundant species in BP patients [38], consistent with previous data [229,230]. In addition to being implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and other minor skin infections such as folliculitis and impetigo, Staphylococcus aureus, a commensal species that is a major component of the skin microbiota, has also been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus with renal and skin involvement [231] and is the leading etiologic agent of osteomyelitis [232], septic arthritis [233], and sepsis [234]. Furthermore, Staphylococcus aureus can colonize chronic wounds typical of the genetic blistering disease epidermolysis bullosa [235]. Notably, in line with Miodovnik et al. [5], who identified Proteobacteria as the most abundant phylum in non-lesional sites of BP patients and healthy subjects, Scaglione and coauthors found a prevalence of Proteobacteria >5% in only one patient, supporting the low pathogenicity of this phylum [38]. In a recent multicenter study [236], substantial differences in the skin microbiota were detected between BP patients and age- and sex-matched controls, with a significant reduction in the alpha diversity in both perilesional and contralateral sites of patients, as also reported for epidermolysis bullosa acquisita [237], psoriasis [238], and atopic dermatitis [239]. The authors observed an inverse correlation of disease status with Cutibacterium acnes, one of the most abundant bacteria in the skin microbiota, which, although acting as an opportunistic pathogen leading to various inflammatory conditions both in the skin and many other internal organs, is generally considered a commensal species implicated in maintaining skin health through the production of SCFAs, which can limit pathogen colonization [236,240,241,242]. The relative abundance of Staphylococcus aureus was increased in both perilesional and contralateral lesions and in sites rarely affected by BP, consistent with the higher prevalence of this species in the nares and on the surface of unaffected skin of BP patients compared with matched controls observed by Messingham and coauthors [230] and the significant positive correlation with disease severity [236]. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus hominis also exhibited significantly negative correlations in perilesional and contralateral sites of patients but not in any matched controls, suggesting that Staphylococcus aureus is an important biomarker of BP, although it remains unclear whether PV patients were colonized by this species before developing the disease [215,221].
        Overall, these findings indicate that the skin microbiota may play a key role in BP, although published cross-sectional studies do not allow us to exclude the observed differences in the composition of microbial communities (i.e., a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes in affected subjects) derive from the disease. In particular, the skin pathogen Staphylococcus aureus appears as a pivotal indicator of BP and is associated with the severity status of the disease, suggesting that modulation of the skin microbiota, even with early antibiotic treatment, could represent an effective therapeutic strategy for BP.
      
    
    
      7. Conclusions and Future Challenges
      In recent years, the role of microbiota, particularly in the human gut, has been increasingly investigated in both healthy subjects and diseases. Perturbations in the balance of microbial communities have been associated with a higher risk of developing a variety of pathological conditions through the production of metabolites that, acting as antigens, can stimulate intestinal epithelial cells, cause damage to the intestinal barrier, and trigger autoimmune responses and subsequent inflammation. BP and PV are the most common chronic autoimmune bullous diseases, and despite distinct physiopathology and clinical signs, their etiology, at least partly unknown, has been linked to an enrichment of pathogenic bacteria and a generally higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and to a depletion of probiotics/beneficial species, along with specific associations between certain bacterial taxa and disease autoantibodies and the involvement of microbial function alterations. Data gathered so far are suggestive of a potentially relevant role of changes in the microbiota composition and diversity in the development and progression of BP and PV, although with different levels of evidence depending on the body district (Table 5) composition.
      While the relationship between the alpha and beta diversity indices in the skin and oral cavity and the prevalence of the two diseases is still poorly explored, growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota alterations in the beta diversity may contribute to BP risk, with certain microorganisms and pathways directly involved in the link between gut dysbiosis and disease activity. In contrast, the role of the gut microbiota in the etiopathogenesis of PV remains controversial, as only a few studies documented significant variations in the composition and diversity of microbial communities between patients and healthy controls. Overall, published studies are based on a cross-sectional design and a limited number of subjects, given the rarity of BP and PV. Additionally, most of the research was conducted in Asian countries, which represents a potential bias in the result interpretation due to the possible influence of lifestyle and dietary habits on the composition of the microbiota. Heterogeneity between studies owing to different sequencing methods (e.g., 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic analysis, and metabolome sequencing), populations, diet, age-related alterations in the gut microbiota, disease severity, presence of comorbidities, and pharmacological treatments makes comparison of results difficult and needs further validation in future studies. Multicenter studies enrolling a large number of subjects and possibly performed in different geographical areas are therefore warranted to verify the current data and the possibility of a causal relationship, also through the analysis of microbe-microbe interactions to determine which microorganisms and/or strains can be unequivocally associated with BP and PV development and which instead can be beneficial for their management, together with experimental studies aimed at identifying plausible biological mechanisms.
      The knowledge gained so far, and future data will help to shed light on both a complete picture of the development and diagnostics of BP and PV, also by detecting bacterial markers and possible alternative treatment strategies for these two conditions. In particular, modulation of the intestinal microbiota by oral prebiotics (a group of nutrients, namely plant fiber, used to feed the gut commensals) and probiotics (live strains of selected microorganisms, mainly of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, which, if administered in adequate amounts, confer a healthy balance to the host’s gut) have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic effects, thus acting as therapeutic agents [27]. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), aimed at restoring the homeostasis conditions of the microbiota habitat and normal SCFA synthesis, has been successfully applied in the treatment of numerous disorders, such as Crohn’s disease, hepatic encephalitis, metabolic diseases, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and allergic and autoimmune diseases, and could therefore represent an additional treatment option in bullous diseases, also in light of the ongoing study of new methods to minimize the side effects of FMT and replenish only species with selected characteristics [27]. At the same time, the development of bacteriotherapy, which is based on the topical application of prebiotics and probiotics, the latter already in use to combat skin aging, could improve skin health by promoting the growth of beneficial species (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermis), eliminating pathogens (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus), and enhancing the skin’s natural defense barrier [211,212,214]. Therefore, the collected findings, in addition to providing new insights into the pathogenesis of bullous diseases, pave the way for the beginning of a novel era in their treatment through a holistic approach, including the use of multiple methods, such as FMT, oral and topical pre- and probiotics, and, possibly, the use of antibiotics against oral opportunistic infections occurring in PV as adjuvants to traditional therapies.

Title: A Paradigm Shift in SSTI Management: The Multifunctional Role of Extracellular Vesicles

Abstract: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are becoming an urgent public health issue worldwide. The globe is facing a growing problem with drug-resistant germs, and current treatments are not quite cutting it. There is a real need for new therapies that can tackle these challenges more effectively. This brings us to an interesting question: Can extracellular vesicles (EVs) from different sources, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), immune cells, or even plants and animals, help in treating SSTIs, especially given the rise in drug resistance? Studies have shown that MSC-derived EVs are particularly noteworthy because they carry components such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that can work together to fight infections, boost the immune response, and aid in healing. These vesicles play a role in how our body interacts with infections, helping to clear bacteria, reduce inflammation, and promote tissue repair. We also see that EVs from plants and bacteria can directly fight off germs, while those from animals can support the healing process of skin. Although early studies have shown promise for EV therapies, there are still hurdles to overcome, such as ensuring consistent production and delivery. This review looks at the potential of EVs as powerful agents in managing infections and supporting healing, highlighting an exciting area of research in medicine.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are a diverse group of bacterial infections of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle planes [1]. They range from the mildest presentations (cellulitis) to more serious ones (necrotizing fasciitis) and are among the most common infections both in the community and in the hospital setting [2]. SSTIs are particularly prevalent among individuals with diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or compromised immunity [3,4] and are the third most frequent cause of emergency department visits [3].
      Globally, SSTIs have an estimated rate of 24.6 per 1000 person-years, with higher rates found in high-income nations such as the U.S. (77.5 per 1000 person-years) [5]. Hospitalization increased by 29% in the early 2000s, most frequently because of community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus CA-MRSA [6,7]. Risk is age-, sex-, and socioeconomic-status-dependent, with highest incidence rates in the elderly and high-risk groups [5,6,7]. Hospital data estimate SSTIs contribute 7–10% to infection load [7], with unacceptably high incidences among diabetic patients—up to 86.5% in a study in Pakistan [8]. Resistance is also common, found in 47% of SSTIs in a Ugandan study on multidrug-resistant organisms [9] and over 64% in an Indian tertiary care hospital on Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter (ESKAPE) pathogens [10].
      Despite the fact that 70–75% of SSTI patients are treated in outpatient care, recurrence, antibiotic resistance, and failure of therapy impose a significant health burden [11]. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains a heavy burden, with prevalence of SSTI-associated in Asia ranging from 7.3% to 74% and similarly high elsewhere [12,13]. The emergence of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) has also made things challenging in both hospitals and communities [14]. SSTIs are more prevalent among men (60–70%) and occur most frequently in the 45–64-year age group [15], although rising hospitalization rates in younger adults indicate changing risk factors [16].
      In the face of mounting drug resistance and limitations of current treatments, novel approaches are gaining traction. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their secretome of antimicrobial peptides and extracellular vesicles (EVs) have demonstrated promise with immunomodulatory and antimicrobial functions [17,18], notably against such pathogens as S. aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Clostridium perfringens [19]. EVs from MSCs, immune cells, bacteria, plants, and animals have bioactive cargo (miRNAs, proteins, lipids) to regulate inflammation, enhance tissue repair, and combat infection. Their direct application in SSTI treatment is yet to be fully investigated. This mini-review identifies the therapeutic use of MSC-derived and other biologically derived EVs for SSTI therapy, with emphasis on mechanisms of action, current evidence, and translational potential against antibiotic resistance. Figure 1 depicts global incidence trends, hospital burden, risk populations, and imperatives of antibiotic resistance and highlights emerging treatment platforms such as MSCs, EVs, and AMPs.
    
    
      2. Key Bacterial Pathogens in SSTIs
      SSTIs represent a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes and are caused by a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. Of these, the most frequently implicated are S. aureus and S. pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS), although the offending pathogen will generally differ based on infection, exposure, and host factors such as immune status and comorbid conditions.
      
        2.1. Streptococcus aureus
        S. aureus is the predominant and most common pathogen in SSTIs, presenting with conditions ranging from impetigo to necrotizing fasciitis and cellulitis [20,21]. Its ability to colonize the skin and mucosa, along with the predispositions offered by such conditions as diabetes or immunosuppression, may increase its occurrence. Of particular concern is methicillin-resistant S. aureus or MRSA, carrying the mecA gene that encodes PBP2a, which then confers beta-lactam resistance [22]. MRSA causes higher morbidities, treatment failures, and healthcare costs both in-community (CA-MRSA) and in-hospital (HA-MRSA) [23,24]. Treatment often consists of prolonged courses of antibiotics, and IV therapy and drug monitoring may be required in case of invasive infections [24]. Both MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus express numerous virulence factors, including adhesions proteins (fibronectin-binding proteins, EbpS, ClfA/B), the ability to form biofilms, immune evasion mechanisms (Protein A and capsular polysaccharides), and tissue-destructive toxins (α-toxin) [25,26,27,28,29,30,31]. CA-MRSA strains, such as USA300, often carry Panton–Valentine leukocidin (PVL), linked to tissue necrosis, and show hyperactive agr quorum-sensing systems that enhance toxin production [32,33,34]. Additional virulence and resistance genes carried on mobile genetic elements such as staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) and arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), aside from causing antibiotic resistance, enhance bacterial colonization, persistence, and virulence [35]. Wall teichoic acids and, in some strains, TSST-1 further amplify the pathogenicity of MRSA [36,37]. While MRSA is more often linked with adverse outcomes, some MSSA strains, such as ST398, are also highly virulent [38]. Clinical studies suggest higher morbidity and mortality with MRSA due to resistance and virulence synergy, though experimental data on relative virulence remains mixed, with strain variability and host factors playing significant roles [39,40,41]. Empirical treatment often includes clindamycin, doxycycline, TMP-SMX, or vancomycin depending on resistance and severity.
      
      
        2.2. Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes)
        Streptococcus pyogenes is a key cause of SSTIs, particularly cellulitis and erysipelas. Cellulitis affects deeper, subcutaneous tissues, while erysipelas is more superficial, involving the upper dermis and lymphatics and leading to severe conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) [42,43]. Both present with redness, heat, and swelling, and erysipelas especially shows raised, well-defined borders. It can progress rapidly and often involves lymphatic streaking [42]. Meanwhile, noninvasive infections such as pharyngitis, impetigo, and scarlet fever are typically localized and transmitted via respiratory droplets or direct contact [43]. Postinfectious sequelae, including rheumatic fever and APSGN, arise from autoimmune or immune complex-mediated responses occurring weeks after the initial infection [44]. S. pyogenes exhibits a wide range of clinical manifestations categorized by infection type and serotype. Over 80 M protein serotypes determine strain-specific virulence, with Class I strains linked to rheumatic fever and Class II strains associated with acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) [45,46]. The M protein is a key virulence factor that aids in immune evasion by inhibiting phagocytosis and forms the basis for strain typing [47]. It invades tissues rapidly through various virulence factors, including M protein, which inhibits phagocytosis; streptolysins and hyaluronidase, which promote tissue degradation; and superantigens, which trigger excessive immune activation [48]. Other key virulence factors include Streptolysin O (SLO), an oxygen-labile, immunogenic cytotoxin that forms pores in host cell membranes, causing lysis of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. It also induces production of anti-streptolysin O antibodies (ASO), used diagnostically. Meanwhile, streptolysin S (SLS) is an oxygen-stable, nonimmunogenic cytotoxin responsible for beta-hemolysis on blood agar and cytotoxic to host cells [49]. Pyrogenic exotoxins (SpeA, SpeB, SpeC) are superantigens that induce cytokine storms in diseases such as scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome; SpeB also has a role as a protease that breaks down host tissue [50]. Furthermore, streptokinase converts plasminogen to plasmin, which promotes fibrin degradation and bacterial spread [51]. Hyaluronidase and DNases also facilitate tissue invasion and NET evasion by degrading connective tissue and extracellular DNA, respectively [52]. Protein F and lipoteichoic acid enhance adherence to epithelial cells, enabling colonization, and C5a peptidase prevents neutrophil recruitment by degrading C5a [53]. Additional proteases, amylases, and esterases are involved in immune modulation, tissue destruction, and systemic dissemination, making S. pyogenes a highly versatile and invasive pathogen [54]. Treatment of severe infections involves high-dose intravenous penicillin in combination with clindamycin to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis and reduce toxin production.
      
      
        2.3. Clostridium perfringens
        Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic, spore-forming, Gram-positive bacillus that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of life-threatening soft tissue infection, primarily gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis) [55]. The bacterium frequently infects contaminated deep wounds, as in traumatic injury, crush injury, and surgical wounds, in which anaerobic conditions promote bacterial multiplication and spore germination [56]. The harm caused by C. perfringens is largely attributed to its powerful exotoxins, especially alpha-toxin (lecithinase), which disrupts cell membranes through phospholipid hydrolysis, causing extensive tissue necrosis, hemolysis, and vascular leakage [57]. Another major toxin, theta-toxin (perfringolysin O), forms pores in host cell membranes and causes vascular damage, myocardial depression, and circulatory collapse, contributing to systemic toxicity [58]. Treatment requires prompt and aggressive surgical debridement to remove necrotic tissue, along with high-dose intravenous penicillin to suppress bacterial growth [59]. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is often employed as an adjunct therapy, utilizing the oxygen-dependent metabolism of anaerobic bacteria to inhibit growth and enhance healing [60]. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are essential to maximizing results in clostridial infection patients.
      
      
        2.4. Others
        While S. aureus and GAS dominate the SSTI realm, there are other pathogens with significant roles under specific clinical conditions. Gram-negative bacilli such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Aeromonas hydrophila are significant pathogens of SSTIs after exposure to freshwater. P. aeruginosa is endemic in water sources such as pools and hot tubs and can lead to folliculitis, wound infections, and severe burn wound infections with blue-green discharge and drug resistance due to biofilm production [61]. E. coli, especially pathogenic species such as O157:H7, can have the potential to cause SSTIs in contaminated freshwater systems, though more notoriously for gastrointestinal infection [62]. A. hydrophila, which is a common inhabitant of freshwater and brackish environments, is a causative agent of a spectrum of SSTIs, from cellulitis to necrotizing fasciitis, predominantly in water-exposed wounds. It secretes tissue-degrading enzymes and possesses increasing multidrug resistance and is thus an emerging pathogen in burn and trauma infections [63].
        Pathogens of animal bites such as Pasteurella multocida (most commonly from cats), Pasteurella canis and Capnocytophaga canimorsus (from dogs), and Eikenella corrodens (from human bites) can potentially produce rapidly progressing infections that extend from localized injuries to full-blown systemic disease [64]. C. canimorsus, a Gram-negative rod found in the oral flora of dogs and cats, typically produces symptoms 3 to 5 days after a bite or scratch [65]. Infection can promptly progress from nonsignificant local symptoms (swelling, erythema, blisters, pain, purulence) to systemic infection, sepsis, and potentially death, most notably in hosts who are immunocompromised such as asplenic individuals or those who have liver disease [66]. It may cause fulminant septicemia with shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple organ failure. Meningitis and severe sepsis are also seen in immunocompetent individuals [67]. Prompt wound cleansing in the initial stages and prompt antibiotic treatment (penicillin G or beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations) are key to prevention. Pasteurella multocida, transmitted primarily through cat bites, is infamous for inducing spreading soft tissue infections with swelling, erythema, and pain within 24 h of the bite. It can produce cellulitis, abscess, and systemic infection if not treated [68]. Pasteurella canis and Capnocytophaga canimorsus in dog bites also cause rapidly progressing infections with the potential for systemic dissemination [69]. E. corrodens, a human oral flora organism, is implicated in human bite wounds and clenched fist injury. It causes virulent soft tissue infections that can progress rapidly without intervention [70].
        Vibrio vulnificus and Mycobacterium marinum are notable sea- and freshwater-borne pathogens that cause serious SSTIs, mostly in immunocompromised individuals [71,72]. V. vulnificus, a bacterium found in warm seawater, causes progressing wound infections and necrotizing fasciitis, typically acquired by exposure of an open wound or raw seafood ingestion [71]. It is highly fatal and requires immediate antibiotic treatment and surgery. M. marinum, present in aquarium water, causes chronic localized infection such as “fish tank granuloma” following trivial trauma to the skin [72]. It requires a prolonged course of antibiotic treatment and sometimes surgery. Prevention is by avoiding contact with infected water and wound care [73]. Table 1 shows the major bacterial pathogens responsible for SSTIs, including the common types of infections they cause, their principal virulence factors, known resistance mechanisms or notable strains, and key treatment considerations.
      
    
    
      3. Epidemiological Evidence of Antibiotic Resistance in SSTIs
      Emergence of antimicrobial resistance in SSTIs is becoming a global concern with regional and organism-specific variations. MRSA is the major resistant pathogen, accounting for 44% of SSTIs in Uganda [74] and having risen in Gabon from 3% over an 11-year period to 20% [75]. MRSA isolates were 94% resistant in Taiwan towards erythromycin and clindamycin but susceptible towards linezolid, teicoplanin, and vancomycin [76]. While in Europe the prevalence of MRSA is below 1% in some countries [77], in some parts of South America, Asia and the US, it is more than 60%, and it may be greater than 50% in some African regions [78]. In Malaysia, MRSA constituted 19.4% of blood isolates of S. aureus from 41 hospitals [79]. In US emergency-department-related SSTI cases, MRSA accounted for 54.8% of cases [80], whereas 4.5% of shelter residents were found to be the 2006 prevalence [81].
      Resistance among Group A Streptococcus (GAS) to macrolides and lincosamides is also increasing, with erythromycin resistance reported as high as 90% and clindamycin resistance up to 50% in some regions [82,83]. This geographic variability hinders empirical therapy, particularly for those allergic to penicillin [84]. A study conducted in Kuala Lumpur reported 42.1% of surgical site infection isolates as MDROs [85]. Clostridium perfringens shows resistance to multiple drugs including tetracycline, lincomycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and cefotaxime [86]. Additionally, 61% of Gram-negative SSTI isolates were ESBL producers [87], and 27% showed carbapenem resistance [88]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa remains challenging due to intrinsic and acquired resistance [89], while multidrug-resistant Aeromonas hydrophila strains have been found in both clinical and environmental settings, suggesting possible transmission routes [90]. These trends underscore the need for continuous surveillance, tailored empirical treatment, infection control, and antimicrobial stewardship to address the rising threat of resistance in SSTIs.
    
    
      4. Current Treatment for SSTIs
      Accurate diagnosis, early treatment, and stratified management based on the type and severity of the infection are the cornerstones for the treatment of SSTIs. Diagnosis is mainly clinical, based on signs such as erythema, edema, pain, pus drainage, and systemic signs of fever, which suggest a serious infection [91]. Wound cultures should be performed so as to steer antibiotic therapy. A 5-day course of antibiotic therapy is usually indicated for simple infections and may be extended if the patient is slow to respond [92]. Supportive care such as limb elevation, wound care, and hygiene education must also be given [93]. Other than abscesses, purulent SSTIs are usually treated with incision and drainage, while reserving antibiotics for patients presenting systemic symptoms, or those with immunosuppression or in cases of treatment failure [94]. Empiric oral options include TMP-SMX, doxycycline, or clindamycin; IV options include vancomycin or linezolid. Nonpurulent SSTIs (cellulitis) are mostly caused by streptococci and MSSA and are treated preferably with cephalexin or IV cefazolin; vancomycin is used if an MRSA infection is suspected or if there are allergies against beta-lactams [95]. Necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical emergency in which immediate debridement should be performed along with the institution of empiric IV broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., vancomycin plus cefepime, or piperacillin-tazobactam) [96]. Clindamycin or linezolid may also be given for toxin suppression [97]. Animal bites are usually treated with amoxicillin/clavulanate, or doxycycline for those allergic to penicillin. Mild folliculitis can be managed with topical therapies, whereas extensive folliculitis might require systemic treatment [98]. Recurrence can be reduced by follow-up in 48 to 72 h, adjusting antibiotics as guided by culture, and addressing risk factors [99].
      With recent treatment advances, outcomes have improved, especially in resistant, toxin-producing, and polymicrobial infections. Newer agents such as delafloxacin and omadacycline span broad coverage, including MRSA and some ESBL-producers [100]. In addition, long-acting lipoglycopeptides, namely dalbavancin and oritavancin, allow for a once-weekly dosing schedule, rendering these drugs potentially viable candidates for outpatient treatment of SSTIs [101]; however, their exact role in the management of severe SSTIs still needs to be well elucidated. Clindamycin, linezolid, and tedizolid (a next-generation oxazolidinone with less side effects) remain important for toxin suppression in TS [102,103]. Empiric combination regimens, especially a combination of a broad-spectrum β-lactam (piperacillin–tazobactam or cefepime) with a toxin-suppression agent such as clindamycin or linezolid, are increasingly being employed for necrotizing SSTIs and have shown improved outcomes [104].
      Adjunctive therapies such as IVIG may possibly work against streptococcal toxic shock by neutralizing superantigens [105], whereas HBOT could be beneficial for necrotizing infections but should never delay definitive treatment [106]. Treatment options now focus prominently on PK/PD-based antibiotic dosing to maximize penetration into tissues with poor perfusion, with prolonged or continuous infusion of β-lactams and serum-level monitoring of drugs such as vancomycin being a good example in achieving high efficacy and low toxicity [107,108]. In parallel, regenerative strategies include the use of MSCs and their EVs. MSCs carry out immunomodulatory and tissue-repair functions, mainly being useful in chronic or ischemic SSTIs. In addition, MSC-derived extracellular vesicles deliver miRNAs, cytokines, and growth factors to injured tissues, which favor repair processes sans any risks connected with live cell therapies. Although this is mostly proof-of-concept and preclinical, these early translational studies imply that MSCs and EVs could become adjunctive therapies for complex drug-resistant SSTIs in the near future. Table 2 summarizes the clinical management strategies for various types of SSTIs, including first-line antimicrobial treatments, adjunctive therapies, and recent advances in pharmacological and regenerative approaches.
    
    
      5. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs)
      EVs are cell-secreted, membrane-bound nanoparticles from nearly all cell types. Based on their cell origin, size, and biogenesis, EVs are broadly classified into small EVs (sEVs) and large EVs (lEVs) [109]. An understanding of how they are generated and how they choose their cargo is essential in determining their physiological and pathological functions, e.g., immunity, infection, and oncogenesis [110]. Exosomes or sEVs are small vesicles measuring 30–150 nm derived from the endosomal pathway. Exosome biogenesis begins with inward budding of the early endosomal limiting membrane, which creates MVBs that can either fuse with lysosomes to break down the cargo or fuse with the plasma membrane and expel intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) as exosomes into the exterior space [111,112]. Exosome formation occurs by two main routes: the ESCRT-dependent mechanism, where ESCRT-0, -I, -II, and -III complexes and core components such as TSG101 (ESCRT-I) and ALIX (ESCRT-III accessory protein) act sequentially to direct membrane budding and sorting of cargo; and the ESCRT-independent mechanism, which relies upon lipid raft domains and tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs), where tetraspanins including CD9, CD63, and CD81 facilitate vesicle formation and cargo selection [113]. Regulatory proteins such as Rab GTPases (e.g., RAB27a/b, RAB11) regulate MVB trafficking and docking, whereas membrane fusion is regulated by SNARE proteins to allow exosome release [114]. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is also involved in the membrane dynamics and maturation of MVB. Exosomes are often identified by some molecular markers such as tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, CD81), ESCRT-related proteins (ALIX, TSG101), and other markers such as flotillin, HSP70, and HSP90 [115,116].
      lEVs, otherwise referred to as microvesicles or ectosomes, measure approximately 100 to 1000 nm in diameter, but some subpopulations such as large oncosomes measure more than 1 µm in diameter [117]. In contrast to small EVs (exosomes) of the endosomal route, lEVs are created through direct plasma membrane outward budding, and fission and MVBs do not play a role in their biogenesis. lEV production is typically evoked by a rise in intracellular calcium leading to cell membrane phospholipid asymmetry disruption and activation of flippases, floppases, and scramblases to induce membrane curvature [118]. Concurrently, calcium entry facilitates cytoskeleton remodeling via actin filament reorganization that enhances cell membrane protrusion and vesicle shedding. Small GTPases such as ARF6 and members of the Rho family are implicated in membrane traffic, reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and selective cargo loading [119]. Microvesicle formation is generally not dependent on ESCRT machinery, although some ESCRT components may be implicated under specific conditions. Molecular lEV markers include Annexin A1, which in a calcium-dependent manner is a phospholipid binder and contributes to membrane curvature; ARF6, which controls cytoskeletal dynamics; and integrins, particularly in microvesicles from invasive or migrating cells [120]. The heterogenous lEV cargo is typically enriched with ribosomal proteins, factors involved in RNA processing, cytosolic enzymes, and signaling molecules and associated with inflammation, coagulation, cellular stress response, and cancer growth [121]. Table 3 shows the comparison of different types of EVs. Figure 2 shows the biogenesis and release of EVs.
      
        5.1. EVs in Promoting SSTIs
        In SSTIs, EVs are archetypal characters involved in infection dynamics, immune modulation, and inflammation of tissue. They carry a heterogeneous cargo of proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which enable them to affect both host defense mechanisms and pathogen virulence processes [122]. In bacterial SSTIs, S. aureus releases cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (CMVs), also known as S. aureus-derived EVs (SA-EVs), and are loaded with virulence factors such as α-hemolysin, proteases, β-lactamases, and nucleic acids. These vesicles can traverse the epidermal barrier, activate keratinocytes, and initiate inflammatory cascades by cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α, compromising the integrity of the skin and exacerbating infections such as impetigo and atopic dermatitis (AD) [123]. SA-EV secretion is induced in response to environmental stressors such as ultraviolet (UV) light and certain antibiotics, enhancing infection severity [124,125]. SA-EVs also contribute to AD by promoting antibiotic resistance through beta-lactamase delivery, disrupting the epidermal barrier via alpha-hemolysin and protein A, and inducing inflammation [126]. CMVs also mediate antibiotic resistance by transferring β-lactamases, disrupt the epidermal barrier via α-hemolysin and protein A, and promote inflammatory responses [127]. CMVs are also capable of regulating immune responses by inducing proinflammatory cytokines (CXCL8, TNF-α), neutrophil recruitment, and immune cell infiltration, both promoting pathogen clearance and tissue damage [128]. CMVs also enable intercellular communication between S. aureus populations to enable coordinated expression of the resistance and virulence genes [129].
        SA-EVs are also responsible for biofilm formation through enhanced hydrophilicity of the skin surface, enhanced bacterial colonization, and shielding of the pathogen against host immune systems. This biofilm-forming activity is the cause of chronic and recurring infections [130]. In chronic wounds, particularly polymicrobial biofilms such as diabetic foot ulcers, EVs from S. aureus and P. aeruginosa deliver quorum-sensing molecules and extracellular matrix components that reinforce biofilm maturation, modulate immune responses, and promote antibiotic resistance [131]. These mechanisms collectively delay wound healing and perpetuate infection chronicity, highlighting the critical role of bacterial EVs in SSTI pathogenesis and persistence. Membrane vesicles (MVs) carry proteins such as Staphylococcal protein A (SpA), which binds host IgG and blocks complement activation, helping bacteria evade immune clearance. They also induce proinflammatory cytokines via activation of innate immune receptors (TLR2), which can paradoxically contribute to tissue damage and facilitate bacterial spread [132]. The similar MVs also enable the transport of the various factors, such as ferritin and lipoproteins, responsible for iron acquisition. Iron is limited in hosts and is essential for bacterial growth [133].
        In addition, Gram-negative bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) facilitate tissue invasion during infections via several mechanisms based on delivering their virulence factors to host cells, activating host immune responses and aiding in the colonization and dissemination of bacteria [134]. OMVs are filled with numerous virulence factors, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), outer membrane proteins (OmpA), toxins (Shiga toxin and cholera toxin), enzymes, and small RNAs that are all delivered directly to host cells that can damage tissues, disrupt boundaries, and allow the bacteria to potentially invade deeper tissues without direct contact with the host cells [135]. OMVs from pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori and Porphyromonas gingivalis can both degrade mucin layer and tight junction proteins in epithelial cells, disrupting the physical barrier to promote colonization and invasion of tissues [136]. OMV-associated components such as LPS and outer membrane proteins activate pathogenic-associated pattern recognition receptors (TLR4), leading to the activation of signaling pathways (NF-κB, MAPK) that induce, for example, proinflammatory cytokines, promote activation of the inflammasome, and trigger pyroptosis. Inflammation can lead to damage to host tissues, promote vascular permeability, and provide an opportunity for bacteria to spread deep in tissues [137]. OMVs can modulate immune responses to the advantage of bacteria through delivery of factors that may lead to inhibition of immune clearance or even apoptosis of immune cells. An example of this is Neisseria gonorrhoeae OMVs that carry PorB protein to macrophage mitochondria, leading to apoptosis and therefore loss of immune function [138]. OMVs also carry factors associated with adhesion (Ail protein in E. coli; Ipa proteins in Shigella flexneri) and facilitate invasion [139,140]. OMVs can contribute to the formation of the biofilm matrix that can also facilitate persistence in tissues and provide resistance to host defenses and antibiotics [141].
        Fungal pathogens, including Malassezia sympodialis, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans, also release EVs [142]. For example, EVs from M. sympodialis contain allergens such as Mala s1 and s5–13, as well as nucleic acids that promote Th2-type allergic inflammation by inducing IL-4 and ICAM-1 expression in keratinocytes, thereby worsening diseases such as atopic dermatitis [143]. Lysophospholipase in EVs degrades sebaceous lipids, releasing irritating fatty acids that disrupt barrier integrity and increase permeability resulting skin barrier degradation [144]. A study demonstrated that EVs from Candida albicans play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of SSTIs by carrying bioactive molecules, including proteins, lipids, enzymes, and RNAs, which promote biofilm formation, deliver virulence factors, and influence host cell behaviors such as proliferation and collagen deposition, potentially impairing wound healing [145]. Specifically, EVs stimulate cytokine production (IL-6, IL-4, IL-12, IL-10, TGF-β, TNF-α), contributing to local inflammation. During biofilm development, EVs enrich the extracellular matrix, shielding the fungus from antifungal agents and mediating drug resistance. This is evident in ESCRT-deficient mutants, where reduced EV release increases drug susceptibility [146]. Cryptococcus neoformans-EVs play a significant role in SSTIs by transferring virulence factors that guarantee fungal survival and host invasion. Vesicles interact with immune cells, particularly macrophages, which alter host responses and exacerbate inflammation. EVs can also guarantee fungal dissemination by impacting the host’s immune signaling. Experiments have shown that EVs impact fungal biology and host–pathogen interaction, resulting in skin lesions in cutaneous cryptococcosis [147]. Table 4 organizes the pathogenic roles of microbial EVs in SSTIs.
      
      
        5.2. EVs in Supressing SSTIs
        EVs play a pivotal role in modulating SSTI suppression because they have the dual capability to modulate immune response as well as stimulate tissue regeneration. Released by numerous cell types such as keratinocytes, immune cells, endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and MSCs, as well as bacterial, plant, and animal cells, these nanoscale, membrane-bound vesicles harbor bioactive cargos such as proteins, lipids, mRNAs, and microRNAs that allow them to modulate multiple biological processes that are essential for SSTI resolution [148,149].
        EVs derived from cells inhabiting the skin such as keratinocytes play a role in innate immune activation by regulating the functions of macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils. For instance, keratinocyte-derived EVs can carry immunoregulatory molecules such as anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β), microRNAs (miR-146a, miR-21), and suppressive proteins that modulate the activation state of immune cells. These EVs can interact with macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells to dampen proinflammatory responses, especially after the resolution of an infection or during wound healing [150]. Keratinocyte-derived EVs also deliver AMPs, such as β-defensin 2 and S100A12, as well as chemoattractants including CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL5, and CXCL6, which contribute to immune cell recruitment, with broad-spectrum activity and direct antibacterial action on bacteria such as S. aureus [151].
        Keratinocyte-derived EVs also control local immunity by carrying cytokines and microRNAs that control inflammation, suppressing excessive immune activation while maintaining effective antimicrobial defense. Moreover, KC-EVs enhance skin barrier function by promoting keratinocyte proliferation and migration for re-epithelialization and restoration of barrier integrity after infection-induced tissue damage [152]. Keratinocytes stimulated with S. aureus enterotoxin B release EVs containing MHC molecules capable of enhancing CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation, suggesting an immunostimulatory role in cutaneous defense [153]. A study also demonstrated that keratinocyte EVs have been shown to influence macrophage polarization, promoting a shift from the proinflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. M2 macrophages secrete IL-10 and TGF-β, which are critical for tissue repair, extracellular matrix remodeling, and suppression of immune overactivation. This transition is essential for preventing chronic inflammation and facilitating skin regeneration after injury [154]. Keratinocyte-derived EVs contain human β-defensin 3, which influences immune cell behavior, including macrophage polarization and dendritic cell activation. These vesicles not only inhibit microbial growth by directly targeting pathogens but modulate inflammatory signaling to limit tissue damage [155]. Furthermore, keratinocyte EVs facilitate intercellular communication essential for wound healing by promoting keratinocyte proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Keratinocyte-EVs are involved in skin homeostasis and wound healing and pigmentation. They carry proteolytic enzymes, such as cathepsin B and matrix metalloproteinase-1, and TGF-binding proteins, which activate fibroblasts to remodel the extracellular matrix and promote keratinocyte migration [156].
        Notably, fibroblast-EVs are an extremely heterogeneous cell population, the functional modes of which are regulated by the biological properties of the donor fibroblasts and the microenvironment. This heterogeneity is a reflection of the inherent diversity of fibroblast subtypes in different anatomical locations, and their ability to adapt dynamically to physiological and pathological stimuli, including infection, inflammation, and tissue injury [157]. Fibroblast-EVs enhance keratinocyte migration and protect against oxidative stress, underscoring their role in skin homeostasis and repair. Importantly, fibroblast-EVs from scleroderma patients exhibit dysregulated collagen-related miRNAs that enhance fibrotic responses, suggesting a contribution to disease pathogenesis [158]. For example, in the presence of SSTIs, PAMPs and proinflammatory cytokines can modulate fibroblast activity, leading to the release of EVs with modified cargo that may exacerbate or resolve inflammation. These infection-altered EVs could affect processes such as wound healing, immune cell recruitment, and matrix remodeling, ultimately impacting tissue regeneration and disease progression [159].
        Adipocyte-derived EVs have been reported to modulate inflammatory responses by managing cytokine release and the activation of immune cells. Vesicles have been reported to suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and promote the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10. This immunomodulation is required in the process of suppressing collateral tissue damage and promoting a regulated healing response [160]. It can strengthen the host’s resistance to infection-related tissue deterioration. The indirect antimicrobial benefits of restoring vascularization, improving barrier function, and suppressing excessive inflammation are crucial in managing SSTIs and preventing chronic wound formation. Notably, adipose-derived stem cell EVs have been found to inhibit inflammatory mediator production and release, suggesting a therapeutic application in decreasing overactive or chronic inflammation in SSTIs [161] whereby adipose-derived stem cells EVs indeed stimulate ECM remodeling by modulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and deposition of collagen, critical processes for effective wound healing. These regenerative properties make Ad-EVs good candidates for wound therapy complicated by infection, ischemia, or diabetes [162].
        MSC-EVs are a new and hopeful approach to treating SSTIs that offer a cell-free therapeutic agent with a blend of regenerative, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial functions. MSC-EVs are nanoscale extracellular vesicles secreted by MSCs and are extensively loaded with bioactive molecules, including microRNAs, proteins, and lipids. These vesicles replicate most of MSC’s therapeutic actions but with stability, storage, and safety advantages, thus becoming a potential substitute for live-cell therapies [163]. Perhaps the most significant manner in which MSC-EVs exert their therapeutic activity in SSTIs is through immunomodulation by promoting macrophage polarization from a proinflammatory M1 type to an anti-inflammatory and tissue-healing M2 type [164]. This modulation, mediated predominantly by microRNAs miR-21 and miR-223, results in suppression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, thereby establishing a wound-healing environment for tissue regeneration [165]. MSC-EVs further directly induce proliferation and migration of dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes leading to skin repair cell types and hence driving wound closure and re-epithelialization. They also assist in reducing the development of scars by regulating expression of collagen subtypes and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β isoforms, namely increasing type III collagen and TGF-β3 but inhibiting type I collagen and TGF-β1, the combined effect of which is antifibrotic and anti-scar tissue formation [166]. EVs also interact with key pathways such as Wnt that orchestrate wound healing and tissue remodeling. In addition, MSC-EVs play a key role in promoting angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling, which are essential events for healing the structural and functional integrity of the skin [167]. In preclinical in vivo models, particularly murine models, the therapeutic efficacy of locally administered MSC-EVs has consistently demonstrated the capacity to accelerate wound healing processes, including enhanced re-epithelialization, reduced scar width, and improved overall skin architecture [168]. Cumulatively, the combined therapeutic actions of MSCs and their EVs in SSTIs are multifaceted. MSCs act directly to improve tissue healing and immune response, while MSC-EVs provide a cell-free, yet effective, modality that heals by activating many molecular and cellular mechanisms. These findings identify the potential of MSC-EVs as an emerging treatment modality for wound infection control and patient outcome improvement in SSTIs, which necessitates further translational studies and clinical trials.
        Dendritic-cell-released EVs (DC-EVs) have complementary functions during soft and dermal tissue infections. Although traditionally recognized for their role in antigen presentation and immune surveillance, DC-EVs are now appreciated for their contribution to tissue repair processes, especially in the context of skin and soft tissue injuries [169,170]. It is likely that the most significant contribution of DC-EVs to wound healing involves the recruitment of MSCs to the wound site. DC-EVs naturally encapsulate and carry chemoattractant molecules such as osteopontin (OPN) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Such molecules create a chemotactic gradient that signals MSCs to migrate to the site of the wound [171]. MSCs are very important in wound healing because of their immunomodulatory capacity, secretion of proregenerative factors, and ability to enhance angiogenesis and tissue remodeling. Significantly, the effect of DC-EVs on MSC migration is dose-dependent, suggesting a tightly regulated mechanism by which increasing doses of EVs can increasingly enhance MSC recruitment. While the DC-EVs themselves appear not to directly influence MSC proliferation or differentiation, their ability to direct MSC homing toward damaged tissue is a crucial stepping stone for coordination of the initial stages of wound repair [172]. While the primary evidence is in their chemoattractant function, DC-EVs are also anticipated to play roles in controlling the immune microenvironment of the injury. Immune modulators such as DCs can produce EVs containing anti-inflammatory mediators or propolarizing mediators that provoke macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype, with a function in the resolution of inflammation and tissue repair. Although more direct studies of DC-EVs here are required, it is possible to draw analogies from EVs of other immune cells, which are known to influence macrophage function and wound healing [173].
        B cell-, T cell-, and macrophage-derived EVs play a significant role in immune modulation, inflammation, and repair of tissue. B cell-EVs are filled with MHC-I/II, CD20, and immune-regulatory proteins and can be stimulated by CD40, IL-4, or BCR activation to enhance EV release. These EVs can carry miRNA cargos (miR-155) and induce CD4+ T cell apoptosis, though their role in skin diseases such as bullous pemphigoid (BP) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains underexplored [174]. T cell-EVs contain TCR, CD3, FasL, and subset-specific miRNAs, which affect DC maturation, NK inhibition, B cell activation, and cytokine secretion; for instance, Treg-EVs suppress Th1 function, while CD8+ T cell-EVs induce tumor stroma apoptosis [175]. Macrophage-EVs are of the M1/M2 phenotype and rich in cytokines, Wnt proteins, and cholesterol and control recipient cell function and inflammation. Though they cause inflammation during chronic diseases, macrophage-EVs also promote healing of diabetic wounds by suppressing proinflammatory mediators. Overall, immune cell-derived EVs are emerging as major regulators of immunity and future therapeutic agents in inflammation, cancer, and skin regeneration [176].
        Neutrophil EVs play pivotal roles in innate immune reactions, inflammation, and tissue repair [177]. EVs, which are loaded with antimicrobial proteins, granule enzymes, and surface receptors, are increased in sepsis and inflammation and possess pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. They inhibit microbial growth, modulate platelet–neutrophil interaction, and initiate macrophage autophagy for enhanced pathogen elimination. Neutrophil-EVs can exacerbate inflammation by activating endothelial cells, breaking down extracellular matrix, and triggering keratinocytes in psoriasis or exert anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing cytokine production in NK cells, DCs, and macrophages, as seen in gout and cartilage protection [178]. They also regulate endothelial permeability and vascular remodeling: some EV cargos (S100A8/A9, MPO) undermine barrier integrity, while others (annexin 1) preserve it [155,156]. Because of their dual role, neutrophil-EVs are emerging as important regulators in inflammatory skin diseases, which must be investigated further [179].
        Endothelial-progenitor-cell-derived (EPC-EVs) are found to be effective wound healing mediators, particularly of diabetic wounds. EPC-EVs induce angiogenesis by promoting enhanced endothelial cell growth, migration, and tube formation, as seen in in vitro and in vivo models [180]. EPC-EVs promote the viability of epidermal cells such as HaCaT keratinocytes by triggering their proliferation, migration, adhesion, and survival even in high-glucose conditions. Mechanistically, EPC-EVs carry microRNAs such as miR-182-5p and miR-221-3p, which regulate tissue repair genes (miR-182-5p) inhibits PPARG for enhanced epidermal cell activity [181]. Moreover, EPC-EVs activate prominent signaling pathways such as Erk1/2 and RAF/ERK, which play a vital role in angiogenesis and tissue repair [182]. EPC-EVs also influence the level of extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, MMPs) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8), thereby creating an appropriate microenvironment for wound healing [183]. EPC-EVs have been locally applied in diabetic mouse models to accelerate wound healing, improve collagen alignment, reduce scar formation, and enhance neovascularization. These multifaceted effects render EPC-EVs a cell-free therapeutic candidate for augmenting healing processes in diabetic, chronic, nonhealing wounds [184].
        CMVs from Gram-positive bacteria help regulate soft tissue infections through a variety of mechanisms primarily involving regulation of the host immune response, engaging both innate and adaptive immunity, and facilitating bacterial–host interactions that can affect infection outcomes. CMVs may also stimulate innate immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells through pattern recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). For example, S. aureus CMVs activate macrophages via TLR2, leading to NLRP3 inflammasome activation and production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, which are essential for facilitating the innate immune response to infection [185]. CMVs derived from S. pneumoniae stimulate immune signaling though NF-κB in macrophages, which increases recruitment of immune cells and inflammatory signaling, contributing to the containment of infection [186]. CMVs derived from Listeria monocytogenes can also internalized in nonphagocytic pathways, resulting in autophagic and lysosomal pathways that contribute to the clearance of the pathogen [187]. Meanwhile, CMVs from Bacillus anthracis elicit robust IgM responses against toxin components from SSTIs, enhancing survival in infection models [188]. A study on OMVs from the gut commensal Parabacteroides goldsteinii (Pg OMVs) demonstrated that orally administered Pg OMVs can reach inflamed skin via the gut–skin axis and significantly reduce skin inflammation in psoriasis-like mouse models [189]. These OMVs suppressed epidermal hyperplasia and inflammatory cell infiltration in skin lesions, effectively ameliorating skin and systemic inflammation. Local subcutaneous delivery of Pg OMVs also yielded similar immunosuppressive effects, suggesting their potential as a therapeutic agent for inflammatory skin diseases. OMVs from commensal gut bacteria such as Bacteroides fragilis have been shown to promote the maturation of the immune system and enhance regulatory T cell activation, leading to increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production and prevention of inflammatory disease [190]. A study also explored EVs of S. aureus, Enterococcus spp., and Lactobacillus strains and found them to be protective against HIV-1 infection by virus–cell receptor blocking via steric hindrance and protein receptor shielding. While the study focused on mucosal environments such as the vaginal epithelium, the findings suggest that similar mechanisms may be applicable in skin tissues, where these EVs could contribute to barrier formation and immune modulation. Their ability to inhibit HIV-1 infection underlines a broader immune-protective function, supporting the potential of Gram-positive bacterial EVs as natural immunomodulators in both mucosal and cutaneous contexts [191]. Figure 3 compares the key features of bacterial extracellular vesicles derived from Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
        Although certain strains of Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) are already known to be causative of inflammatory acne, recent studies show that EVs of certain phylotypes may have opposite, beneficial effects. Notably, extracellular vesicles of SLST H1 phylotype possess intense anti-inflammatory capacity and intense sebum production inhibition capability on in vitro skin models, as reported by Pol Cros et al. [192], which provides promising leads towards microbiome-directed therapies for acne and associated skin diseases. Likewise, Staphylococcus epidermidis EVs, a constituent of the commensal skin microbiota, have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in AD in re-establishing skin homeostasis. They have immunomodulatory activity by stimulating antimicrobial peptides human β-defensins 2 and 3 and suppress the growth of S. aureus, a key accelerator of AD. The vesicles modulate inflammatory gene expression, stimulate cell proliferation and migration, and enhance skin barrier integrity. Together, these behaviors reduce inflammation and induce a healthier and protective skin state [193]. Moreover, EVs from Lactobacillus plantarum were reported to enhance anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage polarization, reversing the proinflammatory function of S. aureus EVs in AD [194], also bearing witness to the application of such vesicles in treating hyperinflammatory dermatoses such as eczema. Moreover, S. epidermidis EVs (str. ATCC12228) inhibited psoriasis-like inflammation through the induction of interleukin-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36Ra), once more affirming the diverse and optimistic roles of bacterial EVs in the modulation of skin inflammation, as reported by Gómez-Chávez et al. (2021) [195].
        The medical field recognizes plant-derived EVs as potential therapeutic agents for SSTIs [196]. Biocompatible plant-derived nanovesicles contain different therapeutic components such as proteins and lipids along with RNAs and small metabolites, which demonstrate their therapeutic value. The natural stability and biocompatibility of plant-derived EVs make them valuable for both antimicrobial therapy and wound repair because they can interact with mammalian systems [197]. The antimicrobial nature of plant-derived EVs shows their effectiveness against pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Through the use of mint-leaf-derived nanovesicles in hydrogels (MENV-HG) researchers confirmed their powerful antibacterial effects. The application of these hydrogels on infected skin models produced 99% healing within 10 days while significantly reducing local inflammation [198]. Dandelion-derived vesicle-like nanoparticles (TH-EVNs) block the harmful effects of S. aureus exotoxins. The nanoparticles work to repair wounds through their ability to stimulate keratinocyte proliferation and migration which drive essential skin regeneration processes [199]. In addition to antimicrobial activity, plant-derived EVs promote wound healing actively by modulating various phases of tissue regeneration. The regenerative function of PDVs functions through the four classical phases of wound healing: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Grapefruit-derived EVs (GEVs), for instance, are reported to promote keratinocyte proliferation and migration, increase angiogenesis, and decrease oxidative stress, all essential for efficient wound repair [200]. A novel study showed that exosomes from Flos sophorae immaturus encapsulated in hydrogel improved spinal cord injury recovery by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress [201]. EVs purified from Opuntia ficus-indica fruit (OFI-EVs) may also play a therapeutic role. OFI-EVs were not toxic, and they could reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in vitro. They inhibited proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells and stimulated the migration of fibroblasts, which reflected their activity in wound healing and made their use in treating chronic skin wounds valid [202]. Carrot-derived EVs were also found to induce IL-10 and Nrf2 activation to inhibit inflammation [203]; similarly, lemon-derived nanovesicles reduced ROS levels induced by H2O2 and UVB exposure by activating the AhR/Nrf2 pathway in dermal fibroblast cells [204].
        Animal-derived EVs are a promising class of bioactive nanocarriers for the improvement of wound healing. Bovine colostrum, the highly nutritious early milk secreted following parturition, is a potent source of regenerative factors, and its EVs have also been found to be very useful in tissue repair [205]. Kim et al. (2021) showed that colostrum-derived EVs (Colos EVs) cause dermal fibroblast proliferation, endothelial tube formation, and keratinocyte migration, which are important processes involved in wound re-epithelialization and neovascularization. These EVs are loaded with growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines that provide support for healing from the inflammatory phase to the proliferative phase [206]. Bovine milk is another rich and cheap source of EVs with regenerative and immunomodulatory capacity. These vesicles carry high concentrations of microRNAs (e.g., miR-148a, miR-21), growth factors (e.g., TGF-β and VEGF), and bioactive lipids that facilitate keratinocyte migration and ECM remodeling [207,208]. Milk-derived EVs were shown to suppress overinflammation and stimulate dermal cell proliferation and migration, leading to enhanced restoration of the epithelial barrier and decreased scar tissue formation. Their biocompatibility and nonimmunogenic nature also qualify them for use as topically applied therapeutics in the management of acute and chronic wounds [208]. Platelet-derived EVs are a subset of EVs released during platelet activation and aggregation. These vesicles contain a library of growth factors, including PDGF, TGF-β, VEGF, and chemokines, which are produced by platelets, serving important roles in hemostasis and tissue repair [209,210]. Esmaeilzadeh et al. (2024) demonstrated that PEVs can stimulate fibroblast proliferation, enhance angiogenesis, and modulate immune cell recruitment, creating a proregenerative microenvironment [211]. Of particular note, in chronic wounds such as diabetic ulcers, PEVs inhibited local inflammation and supported increased granulation tissue formation and re-epithelialization. With their native hemostatic and regenerative capabilities, PEVs hold significant promise for acute and chronic wound healing.
        Overall, sEVs play an important role in communication between cells. They carry microRNAs, proteins, and lipids that can change how our immune system reacts, influencing things such as how our body handles inflammation and wound healing. For instance, they help shift macrophages from a proinflammatory state to a healing state, which is essential for repairing tissues. They also encourage the movement of skin cells and promote the growth of new blood vessels, making them key players in the healing process. Furthermore, because the contents of sEVs reflect the condition of their source cells, they can serve as valuable biomarkers for diagnosis. On the other hand, lEVs, particularly those from platelets and endothelial cells, tend to drive inflammation and promote clotting. They release substances that ramp up inflammation and help trigger the body’s clotting responses during serious infections. lEVs also present antigens and attract other immune cells, which helps track the source of these vesicles. Table 5 organizes the diverse roles of EVs in SSTI management, while Table 6 presents how different types of EVs contribute to SSTI management through immunomodulation, antimicrobial cargo delivery, and tissue repair.
      
    
    
      6. Clinical Translation and Future Directions
      The therapeutic application of EVs, particularly those derived from MSCs, immune cells, and plant sources, offers exciting potential for treating SSTIs. These vesicles exhibit regenerative, immunomodulatory, and antimicrobial properties that could revolutionize the management of both acute and chronic SSTIs. However, clinical translation remains in its infancy, hampered by scientific, technical, and regulatory challenges that must be addressed for broader implementation.
      Several early-phase clinical trials (NCT05243368, NCT04652531, NCT04134676) have begun to evaluate the safety and feasibility of EV-based therapies in wound healing, particularly in chronic and diabetic ulcers [212,213]. These studies underscore the promise of EVs in tissue repair, yet widespread clinical adoption is limited because of difficulties in scalable manufacturing, cargo heterogeneity, batch consistency, and delivery optimization [214]. Regulatory bodies emphasize purity, identity, and safety in EV research and use, especially as the discipline heads towards clinical and industrial use. EV purity is important to eliminate contaminants that can cause side effects, and EV identity characterization—what are they and where they originate from—is important considering the broad variety of biological activities of EV subtypes [215,216]. Safety testing is also necessary to make EV preparations free from toxic entities, enabling patient and user safety. Furthermore, for EV-based products to be viable at scale, they must be produced consistently and reproducibly within tightly regulated parameters. To support these ambitions, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) has released the MISEV (Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles) guidelines that offer a foundation for improving study quality, reproducibility, and adherence to regulatory expectations in EV research [217,218].
      To bridge the gap between preclinical research and clinical application, several key priorities must be addressed. First, a deeper mechanistic understanding of EV biodistribution, uptake, and cell-specific interactions is essential. Second, standardized, GMP-compliant production and quality control protocols are needed to ensure reproducibility and safety. Third, engineering approaches that allow for targeted delivery such as surface modification and cargo loading must be optimized to enhance therapeutic precision [219,220].
      The integration of nanotechnology-derived delivery systems such as hydrogels, microneedle patches, and nanocomposites with EVs or exosomes, is a promising method for enhancing therapeutic delivery, diagnostics, and tissue engineering. These delivery vehicles exhibit controlled and sustained release, enhanced biocompatibility, and targeted localization of EVs, thereby harnessing the full therapeutic potential. Hydrogels establish a hydrated, biocompatible environment that protects EVs while facilitating dynamic release [221]; microneedle patches create a noninvasive route for transdermal EV administration [222]; and nanocomposites enhance stability, targeting, and responsiveness to stimuli [223]. This integration facilitates uses such as drug delivery to cancer, real-time disease diagnosis, and regenerative medicine in wound healing or tissue regeneration. Future progress can include the development of intelligent, stimulus-responsive delivery systems, personalized EV-based therapeutics with low immunogenicity, and multifunctional theragnostic platforms, positioning EV-based delivery systems at the forefront of next-generation biomedicine [224,225]. In parallel, EV integration with advanced delivery systems such as hydrogels, microneedle patches, or nanocomposites could improve retention at wound sites and allow for controlled, localized release. Safety profiling remains another critical area, particularly regarding immunogenicity and the long-term effects of repeated administration in humans [226].
      Looking ahead, well-designed, multicenter randomized controlled trials are crucial to validate EV-based therapies for SSTIs. Furthermore, EVs may evolve into theragnostic tools, enabling both targeted treatment and real-time disease monitoring through biosensors or molecular imaging. This dual functionality could usher in a new era of personalized medicine for infectious and inflammatory skin conditions [227]. As the field advances, interdisciplinary collaboration across cell biology, materials science, clinical medicine, and regulatory affairs will be essential. With strategic research and innovation, EV-based platforms hold the potential to redefine the therapeutic landscape for SSTIs and overcome the escalating challenge of antimicrobial resistance [228].
    
    
      7. Conclusions
      SSTIs are becoming a bigger problem, especially with the growing number of pathogens that resist multiple drugs. Treatments currently available are not always effective. This review looks into a promising new option: EVs. These tiny particles could help in several ways, including fighting infections, boosting the immune system, and aiding tissue healing. EVs can come from various sources, such as MSCs, immune cells, bacteria, plants, and even animals. They have various functions, such as helping to change how immune cells work, regulating important substances in the body, breaking down biofilms, and encouraging new blood vessel growth. MSC-derived EVs are particularly interesting because they could be a way to treat tough SSTIs without using live cells. However, translation to clinical practice is still hindered by problems in standardization, delivery, scale-up, and regulatory approval. The path forward must include overcoming these challenges through technological innovation, clinical validation, and regulatory harmonization. EV-based therapies represent a promising adjunct or alternative to conventional antimicrobial therapies and may herald a paradigm shift in SSTI treatment, especially in the era of antimicrobial resistance.

Title: Multispectral Pulsed Photobiomodulation Enhances Diabetic Wound Healing via Focal Adhesion-Mediated Cell Migration and Extracellular Matrix Remodeling

Abstract: Chronic diabetic wounds affect 15–20% of patients and are characterized by impaired healing due to disrupted hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Low-level light therapy (LLLT) has emerged as a promising noninvasive strategy for enhancing tissue regeneration. Here, we developed a multispectral pulsed LED system combining red and near-infrared light to stimulate wound healing. In vitro photostimulation of human keratinocytes and fibroblasts on biomimetic hydrogels enhanced adhesion, spreading, migration, and proliferation via increased focal adhesion kinase (pFAK), paxillin, and F-actin expression. In vivo, daily LED treatment of streptozotocin-induced diabetic wounds accelerated closure and improved ECM remodeling. Histological and molecular analyses revealed elevated levels of MMPs, interleukins, collagen, fibronectin, FGF2, and TGF-β1, supporting regenerative healing without excessive fibrosis. These findings demonstrate that multispectral pulsed photobiomodulation enhances diabetic wound healing through focal adhesion-mediated cell migration and ECM remodeling, offering a cost-effective and clinically translatable approach for chronic wound therapy.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Skin wound healing is a tightly regulated and dynamic biological process comprising overlapping phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling [1,2]. In the inflammatory phase, neutrophils and monocytes are recruited to the wound site, where monocytes differentiate into macrophages that clear cellular debris and pathogens [3]. Migration of fibroblasts, keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and immune cells—alongside cytokine and growth factor signaling—plays a central role in orchestrating tissue repair [4,5,6]. The proliferative phase is marked by cellular expansion, angiogenesis, and ECM deposition to restore tissue architecture [2]. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) has been implicated as a critical regulator of macrophage-mediated repair and ECM remodeling during skin regeneration [7].
      Wound healing is profoundly impaired in patients with diabetes mellitus, a highly prevalent metabolic disorder [8,9]. Approximately 15–25% of individuals with diabetes develop diabetic foot ulcers—non-healing, chronic wounds that dramatically increase the risk of infection and amputation [10,11]. The pathophysiology of diabetic wound healing involves dysregulation at multiple stages of the repair cascade, often exacerbated by hyperglycemia, peripheral neuropathy, ischemia, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation [12,13,14]. These multifactorial impairments result in delayed re-epithelialization, persistent macrophage infiltration, reduced ECM production, and abnormal fibrosis. Current therapeutic approaches for diabetic wound care include debridement, wound dressings, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), nanomedicine, shockwave therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), and photobiomodulation (PBM) [15]. Despite their widespread use, each modality has inherent limitations. For example, debridement and repetitive dressing changes can enlarge wounds or exacerbate patient discomfort, while nanotherapeutics may pose cytotoxic risks at high concentrations [16]. Moreover, there remains an urgent need for cost-effective, noninvasive strategies that achieve antimicrobial efficacy without compromising biological safety [17].
      Recently, low-level laser therapy (LLLT), including red and near-infrared laser- and LED-based platforms, has emerged as a promising approach due to its painless application, minimal adverse effects, and ability to stimulate tissue repair [18,19,20]. Red laser therapy has been shown to promote the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts—two cell types central to re-epithelialization and matrix remodeling—thereby accelerating wound closure [21,22]. Both LLLT and LED photobiomodulation enhance cellular functions by promoting differentiation, proliferation, and anti-inflammatory signaling, facilitating regenerative outcomes [23,24]. Evidence from preclinical studies further supports the therapeutic utility of specific wavelengths. For example, Mineroff et al. demonstrated that LEDs emitting 630–830 nm light accelerate healing by enhancing epithelialization and collagen synthesis [25]. Similarly, Ayuk et al. reported that diabetic wound cells exposed to 660 nm LED light showed increased migration, viability, and collagen production [26]. Red and near-infrared wavelengths penetrate the epidermis and dermis to a depth of approximately 1–2 mm, where they are absorbed by mitochondrial chromophores such as cytochrome c oxidase, triggering ATP production and cellular activation [27]. These findings are particularly relevant for diabetic wounds, where chronic hyperglycemia impairs cell migration, ECM production, angiogenesis, and re-epithelialization [28]. Thus, the ability of LED photobiomodulation to modulate these dysfunctional cellular processes highlights its potential as a regenerative therapy for diabetic wound repair.
      In addition, recent studies have increasingly emphasized the intricate interplay between immune responses, oxidative stress modulation, and mechanical cues in orchestrating effective wound healing, demonstrating that a photosynthetic hydrogel capable of sustained oxygen production promotes skin repair by reprogramming macrophage polarization toward a pro-regenerative phenotype and enhancing immune–angiogenic coordination, thus facilitating neovascularization and tissue regeneration in hypoxic wound environments [29]. Similarly, Qi et al. developed a hybrid injectable hydrogel (RGH) composed of Ruallomelanin nanoparticles, GelMA-PBA and HANB, which effectively scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and restores macrophage balance by interrupting chronic inflammatory loops in diabetic wounds [30]. Building on these insights, our study explores an alternative, material-free therapeutic approach. Specifically, we demonstrate that multispectral pulsed photobiomodulation promotes tissue regeneration by activating intrinsic cellular programs, including keratinocyte and fibroblast migration, focal adhesion signaling, and extracellular matrix remodeling, without reliance on exogenous drugs, oxygen carriers, or implantable scaffolds.
      To this end, we developed and evaluated a multi-wavelength, pulsed LED system that integrates red and near-infrared light to target multiple phases of the wound healing process. Our in vitro results demonstrate that LED photostimulation significantly enhances the proliferation, migration, focal adhesion dynamics, and cytoskeletal organization of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts cultured on biomimetic substrates engineered to mimic native skin matrix stiffness. In a streptozotocin-induced diabetic wound model, daily LED photobiomodulation accelerated wound closure, promoted re-epithelialization, and reduced fibrosis by selectively modulating macrophage infiltration and myofibroblast activation. Taken together, these findings establish a mechanistic foundation for the therapeutic use of LED-based photobiomodulation and highlight its potential as a safe, noninvasive, and cost-effective treatment for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.
    
    
      2. Result
      
        2.1. LED Photostimulation Enhances Keratinocyte and Fibroblast Proliferation
        To evaluate the cytocompatibility of LED exposure, HaCaT keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were cultured on polyacrylamide (PAA) gels and subjected to LED irradiation (Figure 1A). Cell viability assays and Live/Dead staining, conducted 24 h post-treatment, revealed no increase in cell death in either cell type, confirming that the LED photostimulation protocol was non-cytotoxic (Figure 1B,C). Following the confirmation of cytocompatibility, we assessed the proliferative response to LED exposure. HaCaT and HDF cells were stimulated once every 24 h over a 72 h period, and metabolic activity was measured using the MTT assay. HaCaT cells showed a 2.4-fold increase in proliferation by day 1 and a 3.8-fold increase by day 3 relative to untreated controls. HDFs exhibited 3.0-fold and 7.0-fold increases in proliferation at the same timepoints, respectively, both of which were statistically significant (Figure 1D,E).
        To further elucidate whether this proliferation was associated with enhanced cell cycle progression, EdU incorporation and Ki-67 immunostaining were performed. Both assays demonstrated a marked increase in the proportion of actively proliferating cells following LED exposure, as evidenced by the elevated number of EdU-positive nuclei and Ki-67 expression in both HaCaT and HDF populations compared to controls (Figure 1F,G). These findings confirm that LED treatment significantly enhances the proliferative capacity of both keratinocytes (HaCaT) and dermal fibroblasts (HDF).
      
      
        2.2. LED Photostimulation Enhances Cell Migration
        To determine whether LED photostimulation influences the migratory dynamics of skin-resident cells, we conducted single-cell tracking of HaCaT and HDF cells cultured on polyacrylamide (PAA) hydrogels. Cells were monitored by time-lapse microscopy over a 6 h period under control or LED-treated conditions.
        Representative trajectory plots revealed that cells exposed to multispectral pulsed LED stimulation exhibited more extensive migratory paths, with greater radial displacement from the origin. The trajectories also displayed a shift toward warmer colors, corresponding to increased instantaneous migration speeds (Figure 2A,B). Quantitative analysis of migration patterns showed significantly elevated mean squared displacement (MSD) and mean absolute distance (MAD) in both HaCaT and HDF cells subjected to LED photostimulation (Figure 2C–F). These findings indicate that LED exposure enhances both the range and consistency of cell movement over time. Linear regression analysis further revealed stronger correlations (higher R2 values) in the LED-treated groups, supporting a more defined migratory trend.
        To better characterize the kinetics of cell motility, we derived diffusion coefficients and average velocities from MSD and MAD curves. Both parameters were markedly increased under LED stimulation in HaCaT and HDF cells, reflecting enhanced random and persistent migration, respectively (Figure 2G,H).
        To further evaluate the pro-migratory effect of LED irradiation, we conducted a scratch wound assay using HaCaT keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) cultured on polyacrylamide (PAA) gels. LED treatment markedly accelerated wound closure in both cell types. HaCaT monolayers showed significantly enhanced closure at 8 and 12 h post-scratch, while HDF monolayers exhibited a similar response with accelerated closure at 12 and 16 h (Figure 3A,B). Quantitative image analysis using MATLAB confirmed a significantly higher wound closure rate in LED-treated cultures compared to controls, indicating that multispectral pulsed light stimulation enhances collective cell migration in vitro.
        To investigate whether this enhanced migration was associated with molecular changes relevant to wound healing, we examined the mRNA expression of key genes involved in ECM remodeling, synthesis, and cell motility 12 h post-irradiation. In keratinocytes, LED exposure significantly upregulated the expression of IL-6, MMP-2, and MMP-9—genes associated with inflammatory response and matrix degradation—as well as ECM synthesis markers COL3 and fibronectin (Figure 3C). Similarly, in fibroblasts, we observed increased expression of IL-6 and MMP-9, along with elevated levels of COL1, COL3, and motility-associated genes, N-cadherin and vimentin (Figure 3D).
      
      
        2.3. LED Photostimulation Enhances Focal Adhesion Signaling and Cytoskeletal Remodeling
        To investigate whether LED photostimulation influences these migratory mechanisms, we evaluated focal adhesion signaling and cytoskeletal organization in HaCaT keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) cultured on PAA substrates. Immunofluorescence staining for phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK), paxillin, and F-actin revealed distinct changes in cell morphology and adhesion structures in response to LED exposure (Figure 4 and Figure 5). Quantitative image analysis demonstrated a significant increase in F-actin intensity in both cell types following photostimulation, indicating enhanced actin polymerization and cytoskeletal activity during migration.
        In addition to increased F-actin levels, LED-treated cells exhibited greater cell spreading and elongation, accompanied by more pronounced and spatially organized focal adhesion complexes. These morphological features were associated with elevated expression of p-FAK and paxillin at the leading edge, suggesting that photostimulation promotes focal adhesion maturation and actin reorganization. Together, these changes reflect enhanced migratory potential, consistent with both single-cell and collective migration observed in earlier assays.
      
      
        2.4. LED Photobiomodulation Accelerates Wound Healing and Modulates Fibrotic Remodeling in an STZ-Induced Diabetic Model
        To evaluate the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of LED photobiomodulation, we employed a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model of delayed wound healing (Figure 6A). Full-thickness dorsal wounds were generated on Day 0, and mice received daily multispectral pulsed LED treatment for 20 min over a 14-day period. Blood glucose and body weight remained stable throughout the experimental window (Figure 6B), confirming the diabetic condition without systemic deterioration.
        Wound closure was significantly accelerated in the LED-treated group compared to untreated diabetic controls. From Days 6 to 10, LED-treated wounds exhibited consistently greater closure, with a 14% increase in wound closure rate by Day 6 (65% vs. 51% in control mice) (Figure 6C,D). These results demonstrate that LED photobiomodulation enhances re-epithelialization and tissue regeneration during the early to mid-phases of diabetic wound healing.
        To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this enhanced healing, we analyzed the mRNA expression of key wound healing regulators on Days 7 and 14 (Figure 6E). On Day 7, LED-treated wounds showed elevated expression of genes involved in collagen production (Col1, Col3, fibronectin), inflammation (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10), oxidative stress response (Nrf-2, Hmox-1, NQO-1), and ECM remodeling (MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, MMP13). Expression of TGF-β1, Krt1, and pro-angiogenic markers (c-Myc, PDGFRA) was also upregulated. These findings suggest that LED photobiomodulation activates early regenerative pathways, promoting collagen synthesis, resolving inflammation, and facilitating re-epithelialization and angiogenesis. By Day 14, a shift in gene expression was observed: markers of collagen synthesis (Col1), keratinocyte differentiation (Krt1), and angiogenesis (c-Myc, PDGFRA) were reduced in the LED-treated group relative to controls. These data indicate that photobiomodulation may accelerate the wound healing trajectory, promoting early tissue regeneration while simultaneously suppressing excessive ECM deposition and neovascularization at later stages to support proper tissue remodeling.
      
      
        2.5. LED Photobiomodulation Modulates ECM Remodeling and Myofibroblast Activation During Late-Stage Wound Healing
        To assess the structural and cellular remodeling dynamics underlying wound healing in diabetic skin, we performed histological analyses of tissue sections harvested on Days 7 and 14 post-injury. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining revealed hallmark features of impaired healing in untreated diabetic wounds, including platelet aggregation, inflammatory cell infiltration, and epidermal thickening. These pathological features were markedly improved in the LED-treated group at both time points. Masson’s Trichrome staining further demonstrated enhanced collagen organization and ECM remodeling, particularly evident on Day 14, indicating that LED photobiomodulation supports progressive tissue maturation during later stages of healing (Figure 7A–C).
        To further investigate the underlying cellular mechanisms, we performed immunohistochemical staining for F4/80 (macrophages), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA, a marker of myofibroblast activation), collagen I, and TGF-β1. On Day 7, no significant differences were observed in F4/80 or α-SMA levels between groups. However, by Day 14, LED-treated wounds exhibited a significant reduction in macrophage infiltration and α-SMA expression, while collagen I and TGF-β1 levels remained unchanged. These results suggest that photobiomodulation selectively attenuates late-stage inflammatory and fibrotic responses without impairing ECM production or upstream profibrotic signaling.
      
    
    
      3. Discussion
      Efficient wound healing depends on the orchestrated behavior of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts. Keratinocytes initiate re-epithelialization by migrating across the wound bed and proliferating to form a continuous epidermal layer, ensuring coverage and protection of the underlying tissue [31,32]. Dermal fibroblasts, meanwhile, are responsible for the synthesis of key extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including collagen, elastin, and fibronectin, which support structural integrity and enable wound contraction [33,34]. The expansion of these cell populations is essential for wound closure, as keratinocytes contribute to re-epithelialization by rapidly covering the exposed wound bed, thereby forming a physical barrier that prevents infection and supports tissue integrity. In addition, keratinocytes actively secrete growth factors and cytokines that modulate the behavior of neighboring cells and accelerate the repair process [31,35,36,37]. Fibroblasts, upon stimulation by these soluble cues, migrate into the wound site and synthesize extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as collagen and fibronectin, which are indispensable for scaffold formation and mechanical support [37,38,39]. As healing progresses, fibroblast-driven ECM remodeling contributes to granulation tissue formation, while epithelial cells continue to cover the wound area. Ultimately, fibroblast proliferation and matrix deposition coordinate the structural reconstitution required for effective tissue repair.
      Wound healing is a complex and dynamic process involving coordinated cell proliferation, migration, and matrix remodeling at the site of injury [40]. The enhanced migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts observed in response to LED treatment suggests that photostimulation may support the early stages of wound healing by promoting cellular motility. Keratinocytes migrate from the wound margins to re-establish the epidermal barrier, while fibroblasts migrate and differentiate into myofibroblasts, contributing to tissue contraction and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition [41,42]. Our data demonstrate that LED photostimulation significantly accelerates these processes by increasing the rate of in vitro gap closure compared to non-irradiated controls. This enhanced migratory response was accompanied by transcriptional changes in key ECM remodeling enzymes, reflecting a coordinated wound-healing program. IL-6 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are critical for remodeling the damaged ECM and clearing apoptotic cells and inflammatory debris [43,44]. Collagen deposition, particularly COL1 and COL3, provides structural support and tensile strength to the regenerating tissue while also stabilizing growth factor signaling and facilitating cell adhesion [45]. Upregulation of N-cadherin and vimentin in fibroblasts is indicative of enhanced mesenchymal characteristics and migratory capacity [46,47]. Together, these results suggest that LED photostimulation not only enhances skin cell migration in vitro but also activates molecular pathways critical for effective wound closure and matrix remodeling. Although prolonged or excessive expression of MMPs can degrade ECM components and impede healing, transient expression during the early remodeling phase is essential to remove damaged matrix and promote new tissue formation [48,49].
      In support of this, we observed elevated mRNA levels of MMP9, Krt1, and Ki67 in LED-treated skin tissue on Day 7, suggesting an early, regulated response promoting matrix turnover, epithelial activation, and cellular proliferation. While increased MMP activity has been associated with tissue degradation in chronic wounds, the concurrent upregulation of proliferation and epithelial markers suggests a reparative rather than pathological phenotype [50,51]. This is further supported by histological improvements and reduced fibrosis at later time points. Importantly, these findings align with earlier reports showing that acute MMP expression facilitates keratinocyte migration, leukocyte recruitment, and granulation tissue formation during the early inflammatory and proliferative phases of healing [37,52]. Our observed improvement in wound closure and ECM organization supports a regulated remodeling response rather than uncontrolled degradation. Nonetheless, distinguishing between beneficial and maladaptive remodeling requires careful spatiotemporal profiling of proteolytic activity. Future investigations should incorporate quantitative assays of MMP enzymatic activity, assess the balance between MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and analyze protein expression across multiple time points to clarify the functional implications of early MMP induction.
      Cell migration is a fundamental component of wound healing, requiring dynamic remodeling of the cytoskeleton and precise coordination of cell–matrix interactions [53,54]. During directed migration, actin filaments polymerize at the leading edge to form lamellipodia and filopodia, while focal adhesion complexes, including integrins, FAK, and paxillin, anchor the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix, translating mechanical signals into intracellular biochemical responses that drive contractility and motility [55,56,57]. In our study, LED treatment promoted FAK phosphorylation and actin remodeling, suggesting that LED photostimulation facilitates the dynamic turnover of focal adhesions, thereby reinforcing structural support for motility. Taken together, these results indicate that LED photostimulation reinforces the structural and signaling components of the migratory machinery in skin-resident cells. By activating focal adhesion pathways and cytoskeletal dynamics, LED treatment may enhance cell motility and wound closure through mechanically integrated signaling mechanisms, which align with previous reports describing the pivotal role of focal adhesion–based mechanotransduction in wound closure [55,56,57].
      Histological analysis provides crucial insight into the progression and resolution of wound pathology. In this study, we observed that chronic inflammation, delayed epithelialization, and disorganized ECM deposition in diabetic wounds were substantially improved following LED treatment [58,59]. The reduction in F4/80-positive macrophages at Day 14, a time point corresponding to the remodeling phase of wound healing, suggests a decrease in sustained inflammatory burden. Although these findings do not definitively confirm a phenotypic switch from M1 to M2 macrophages, the reduction in overall macrophage presence, coupled with improved tissue morphology and reduced inflammatory infiltration, supports a conclusion of attenuated macrophage-mediated inflammation during the remodeling phase of healing [60,61,62]. However, further analysis using M1- and M2-specific markers, such as iNOS, CD86, CD206, and Arg1, will be necessary to delineate precise immunomodulatory effects.
      Additionally, the significant decrease in α-SMA expression in the absence of changes in collagen I or TGF-β1 expression implies that LED therapy may inhibit myofibroblast differentiation without suppressing ECM biosynthesis [63,64]. These findings align with previous reports suggesting that LED therapy modulates fibrosis by targeting myofibroblast activity [20,64]. In our study, this regulation appears to occur predominantly during the remodeling phase rather than at the initiation of fibrotic signaling. Collectively, our results support the notion that LED photobiomodulation may serve as a therapeutic strategy to limit excessive fibrosis and promote functional tissue repair in chronic wounds [65,66]. Future work will be necessary to delineate the temporal windows in which LED treatment most effectively modulates early fibrotic events.
      While our study demonstrates significant transcriptional modulation of wound-healing-associated genes, including MMPs, IL-6, and COL1A1, further investigation at the protein level is needed to validate the functional significance of these changes. Discrepancies between mRNA and protein expression due to post-transcriptional regulation highlight the need for quantitative proteomic analysis in future work. Additionally, although our in vitro model employed both HaCaT keratinocytes and primary human dermal fibroblasts for reproducibility, it did not incorporate diabetic-specific stressors such as hyperglycemia or advanced glycation end products, which are critical to chronic wound pathology. Future studies should include diabetic patient-derived cells or high-glucose models to more accurately mimic disease conditions, as demonstrated in previous studies [67,68,69]. Finally, while this study focused on the efficacy of a composite multispectral pulsed LED device, it did not dissect the individual effects of each wavelength (670, 780, 830, 910 nm). Although this combined approach reflects real-world clinical practice, it limits our mechanistic understanding. Future investigations using monochromatic or spectrally isolated light sources will be essential to determine wavelength-specific effects on inflammation resolution, ECM remodeling, angiogenesis, and re-epithelialization.
    
    
      4. Materials and Methods
      
        4.1. Photomodulation Device
        Photobiomodulation was performed using a commercially available multi-wavelength LED device (PMD-FA240, Ptech Corp., Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea). The device integrates four laser diodes emitting at red (670 nm) and near-infrared (780 nm, 830 nm, 910 nm). The output powers for each wavelength were 13.6 mW (0.0136 J/s) (670 nm), 3.71 mW (0.00371 J/s) (780 nm), 61.1 mW (0.0611 J/s) (830 nm), and 11.1 mW (0.0111 J/s) (910 nm), respectively. All lasers were operated in pulsed mode with an on-time of 1400 μs and an off-time of 200 μs. For both in vitro and in vivo experiments, LED irradiation was applied for 20 min per session using a fixed distance and perpendicular orientation over a 1 cm2 area, resulting in a total fluence of approximately 93.99 J/cm2 per session.
      
      
        4.2. Preparation of Polyacrylamide (PAA) Gels
        Polyacrylamide (PAA) gels with Young’s modulus of 10.61 kPa—approximating the stiffness of human skin [6]—were fabricated on glass-bottom culture dishes (Confocal Dish, #101350; SPL Life Sciences, Pocheon, Republic of Korea). Gels were activated with 0.5 mg/mL Sulfo-SANPAH (#22589; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) under UV light and coated with 50 μg/mL collagen I (#354236; Corning, NY, USA) to enhance cell adhesion. Gel stiffness was tuned by adjusting the ratio of acrylamide (40% stock solution, #1610140; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and bis-acrylamide (2% stock solution, #1610142; Bio-Rad Laboratories) as crosslinkers. Polymerization was initiated by adding 10% ammonium persulfate (APS; #AMP001; BioShop, Burlington, ON, Canada) and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED; #TEM001; BioShop), following standard protocols [70,71].
      
      
        4.3. Cell Culture and LED Treatment
        The immortalized human skin keratinocyte (HaCaT; cat# T0020001; AddexBio, San Diego, CA, USA) and primary human dermal fibroblast (HDF; CCD-986sk; cat# 21947; The Korean Cell Line Bank, Seoul, Republic of Korea) cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; #10-013-CV; Corning, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; #35-079-CV; Corning, NY, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (P/S; #1514022; Corning, NY, USA). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For in vitro experiments, HaCaT and HDF cells were seeded onto 10.61 kPa collagen-coated polyacrylamide (PAA) gels to mimic the stiffness of native dermal tissue. Prior to LED exposure, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; #70011069; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and covered with PBS containing 2% FBS to prevent desiccation while maintaining cell viability and minimizing optical interference from phenol red. LED photostimulation was then applied directly to the cultured cells for 20 min using the PMD-FA240 device. The cells were exposed to a multispectral output consisting of four pulsed wavelengths (670, 780, 830, and 910 nm) with pulse parameters of 1400 μs on and 200 μs off. The LED source was positioned at a fixed distance perpendicular to the cell surface to ensure uniform light distribution during exposure.
      
      
        4.4. Single-Cell Migration Assay
        HaCaT and HDF cells were seeded onto 10.61 kPa PAA gels at a density of 1000 cells/cm2 to evaluate single-cell migration following LED treatment. After cell attachment to the gel, Hoechst 33,342 (1:1000; #H21492; Molecular Probes, Eugene, CA, USA) was used to stain the nuclei for 1 h. The medium was then replaced, and the cells were exposed to LED treatment for 20 min. Time-lapse images of cell migration were acquired every 10 min for 12 h using an E-VOS M700 imaging system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with a 10× objective lens (NA, 0.3; #AMEP4981; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Cell trajectories were analyzed using TrackMate in FIJI and MATLAB-based program codes. Cell migration was quantified by calculating the mean square displacement (MSD), diffusion coefficient (D), and velocity (V) using previously established equations in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA; version R2023b) [72]. The MSD measures the average displacement of a cell over a specified time interval (Δt). The diffusion coefficient (D = slope/4) was derived from the linear regression of the MSD curves, representing cell dispersion speed. The mean absolute distance (MAD) was used to measure the average absolute displacement of a cell over a specified time interval. The Velocity (V = slope) was derived from the linear regression of MAD, indicating the speed of cell movement regardless of direction. High R2 values (approaching 1.0) suggest a random migration pattern in MSD and a consistent migration pattern in MAD.
        The mean squared displacement at time point I is as follows:MSDi=1N−i∑j=1N−idi,i+j2
        The mean absolute distance at time point I is as follows:MADi=1N−i∑j+1N−i1i,i+j
where
        di,j = displacement (or end-to-end distance) between point i and j;
        li,j = displacement (or end-to-end distance) between point i and j;
        N: total number of points of migrating cell trajectory;
        δt: data sampling time;
        i: number of data points for the time step Δt (i.e., Δt = i δt);
        j: number of data points for averaging (j = 1, 2, …, N − i).
      
      
        4.5. Collective Cell Migration Assay
        To evaluate collective cell migration, HaCaT and HDF cells were seeded onto 10.61 kPa PAA gels using a two-well culture insert (#80206; ibidi, Gräfelfing, Germany) and cultured until a confluent monolayer formed. After removal of the insert to create a uniform wound gap, cells were immediately exposed to LED photostimulation for 20 min. Images of wound closure were captured at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h using an EVOS imaging system and analyzed with MATLAB. The wound area was measured, and the percentage of wound closure relative to the original wound area was calculated using the following equation: Closed area percentage  =  (original wound area—current wound area)/original wound area × 100 [73].
      
      
        4.6. Cell Viability Assay
        Live/dead staining was performed to evaluate cell morphology and viability after LED treatment. Cells were stained using the Live/Dead™ Viability/Cytotoxicity Kit (#3L-3224; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA), which contains 2 μM calcein AM and 4 μM ethidium homodimer-1 in PBS solution. Staining was performed for 30 min in the dark before imaging analysis.
      
      
        4.7. Cell Proliferation Analysis
        To confirm DNA replication, 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeling and visualization were performed. HaCaT and HDF cells were cultured onto a 10.61 kPa PAA gel and treated with LED irradiation. After 24 h, cells were stained with the Click-iT™ EdU Alexa Flour 488 (#C10633; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 2 h in the dark. Next, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; #SM-P01-100; Geneall, Lisbon, Portugal) and stained with the Click-iT reaction mixture containing Hoechst. The percentage of EdU-positive cells was analyzed using ImageJ software (version 1.53c).
        For Ki-67 staining, cells were incubated in a blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin [BSA] with 0.1% Triton X-100), followed by incubation with a primary antibody (1:400; #ab15580; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) and a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit, #A21422; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) along with Hoechst staining in the dark. Images were acquired using E-VOS, and ImageJ was used to quantify the percentage of Ki-67-positive cells.
        Cell proliferation was further evaluated using the MTT assay. The HaCaT and HDF cells were cultured on 10.61 kPa PAA gels and treated with LED irradiation. At 24 h intervals, for a total of 72 h, the culture medium in each well was replaced with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; #M6494; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) and incubated for 2 h in the dark. The formazan crystals formed were solubilized using 200 μL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; #D4540; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). All experiments were conducted in triplicate.
      
      
        4.8. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR)
        Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and mouse skin wounds using TRIzol™ reagent (# 15596018; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Tissue samples were homogenized via sonication using pre-filled tube kits (#BC-1002(c1); Biofactories). RNA was measured using a NanoPhotometer N60 (Implen Scientific Inc., Munich, Germany). The isolated RNA was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using ReverTra Ace™ qPCR RT Master Mix with gDNA remover (#FSQ-301; TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) and a thermal cycler (T100™ Thermal Cycler, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). RT-qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Real-Time PCR master mix (#F0924K; TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) on a QuantStudio Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). Gene expression levels were quantified using the 2−ΔΔCt method, with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) serving as the reference gene [74]. The primer sequences used in this study are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.
      
      
        4.9. Streptozotocin (STZ)-Induced Mouse Model of Diabetes
        Sixteen 7-week-old male Balb/c mice were purchased from Orient Bio Corp. (Seongnam, Republic of Korea). The mice were acclimatized for 1 week before the experiments. All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Soonchunhyang University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in Cheonan, Korea (SCH22-0033). To induce diabetes, mice were fasted for 16 h before receiving intraperitoneal injections of 50 mg/kg STZ (#S0130-500MG; Sigma–Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 5 days. STZ was dissolved in a cold 50 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 4.5; #S1804; Sigma–Aldrich) before administration [75,76]. Non-fasting blood glucose levels were measured, and diabetes was confirmed when levels exceeded 300 mg/dL.
      
      
        4.10. Treatment of Diabetic Mouse Skin with LED
        Mice were placed under general anesthesia using isoflurane (Ifran; Hana Pharm Co., Ltd., Hwa-Sung, Republic of Korea) before wounding and LED treatment. The dorsal hairs were shaved, and the skin surface was cleaned prior to the procedure. Full-thickness skin wounds (10 × 10 mm) were created using sterile scissors and forceps. LED treatment was applied directly to the left-side wound for 20 min daily, whereas the right-side wound served as an untreated control. The LED treatment was administered using the same four-wavelength pulsed mode parameters as described in Section 4.1. Half of the mice were euthanized on day 7 to collect skin samples, and the remaining mice were euthanized on day 14 for further analysis.
      
      
        4.11. Measurement of Wound Closure
        The width and length of the wounds were measured using MATLAB, and wound images were acquired every other day. The first set of images was obtained on day 0 (the day the wound was created). Wound closure was quantified as a percentage of the original wound area using the following equation: Closed area percentage  =  (original wound area—current wound area)/original wound area × 100 [73].
      
      
        4.12. Histological Analysis of Skin Tissues
        Tissue specimens were fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the samples were dehydrated using graded alcohol, cleared with xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded tissues were sectioned into 4 µm-thick slices using a microtome. The sections were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Masson’s trichrome staining, and immunohistochemistry for histological evaluation.
        For H&E staining, specimens were stained for nuclei with hematoxylin for 10 min, washed with running water for 3 min, and subsequently stained with eosin for 1 min and 20 s. Next, the sections were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, cleared with xylene, and mounted. For Masson’s trichrome staining, the specimens were deparaffinized and fixed with Bouin’s Fluid for 60 min, followed by washing under running water for 10 min. The sections were then sequentially stained with Weigert’s iron hematoxylin for 10 min, Biebrich scarlet acid fuchsin solution for 10 min, phosphomolybdic/phosphotungstic acid for 10 min, aniline blue for 10 min, and 1% acetic acid for 5 min.
        For Immunohistochemical staining, unstained sections were pretreated in a microwave, blocked with serum, and incubated with primary antibodies, including F4/80 (CI:A3-1, #NB600-404; Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA), TGF-β1 (TB21, #GTX21279; GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA), alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA; ab5694; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and collagen I (#NB600-408; Novus Biologicals, Centennial, CO, USA). Next, sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature and counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin.
      
      
        4.13. Statistical Analysis
        Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was evaluated using Student’s t-test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with GraphPad Prism version 10 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was set at ns, p > 0.05; * p < 0.05; ** p < 0.01; *** p < 0.001.
      
    
    
      5. Conclusions
      This study demonstrates that pulsed LED photobiomodulation, using a mixed wavelength of red and near-infrared light, significantly accelerates wound healing in both in vitro and in vivo diabetic models. In vitro, photostimulation enhanced the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts cultured on biomimetic polyacrylamide (PAA) substrates with tissue-relevant stiffness. In vivo, LED treatment promoted re-epithelialization, regulated inflammatory responses, and improved extracellular matrix remodeling in STZ-induced diabetic mice, leading to accelerated wound closure and reduced fibrosis. These findings highlight the potential of multi-wavelength, pulsed LED therapy as a noninvasive and tunable strategy for the treatment of chronic wounds. The mechanistic insights gained from this work also support the broader application of photobiomodulation in regenerative medicine and wound care. Future translational studies are warranted to optimize dosing parameters and validate clinical efficacy in human chronic wound settings.

Title: International Consensus Guidelines on the Safe and Evidence-Based Practice of Mesotherapy: A Multidisciplinary Statement

Abstract: Introduction. Mesotherapy is a widely used technique around the world. However, there is currently no internationally recognized, evidence-based standard for its various clinical applications. To address this gap, we have reviewed the current state of the art, critically evaluated its clinical benefits and limitations, and proposed a set of standards including procedural steps, recommended actions, and practical instructions in the form of protocols, guidelines, and expert recommendations. Methods. A team of researchers conducted a comprehensive literature review, selecting studies published between 1976 and 2023. Drawing on the available evidence and the needs expressed by patient associations, 23 clinical questions were developed and presented to a panel of experts. Through multiple rounds of evaluation, evidence-based recommendations were formulated and subsequently submitted for structured evaluation and voting by a broad, multidisciplinary panel of international experts, representing numerous national and international scientific societies. Results. The recommendations outlined in this guideline support the use of mesotherapy across diverse clinical and organizational settings, providing a standardized framework that ensures both efficacy and patient safety in osteoarticular pain, rehabilitation, and dermatological fields. Conclusions. The era of mesotherapy based on personal beliefs now gives way to evidence-based practice. The limitations underscore the need for continued high-quality research and scheduled guideline updates.

Body: 1. Introduction
      In 2025, the Italian Society of Mesotherapy (SIM) celebrates its 50th anniversary. SIM has continuously aimed to understand the advantages and limitations of mesotherapy through critically analyzing the available evidence. Today, mesotherapy represents a therapeutic option capable of achieving clinical effects with low-dose active substances [1].
      Despite numerous publications confirming its efficacy and safety in various clinical conditions, a standardized protocol for its execution has yet to be established [2]. The need for defining a standard may seem restrictive, as it excludes certain applications that do not meet the scientific threshold. However, it is precisely these applications, lacking supporting data, that stand to benefit most from future research. Developing a standard is therefore crucial to mesotherapy being applied as an interesting and futuristic therapeutic tool in patient care. Accordingly, SIM had previously formulated an initial set of evidence-based recommendations to support this objective [3]. Following suggestions from national health authorities, which urge scientific societies to regularly update their guidelines [4], a new and broader systematic review process of the available evidence has been conducted. Although mesotherapy has been used successfully for decades worldwide, there is still a need for standardization in its clinical practice to minimize the risks associated with any infiltrative therapy, underlining the importance of a universally shared guideline. This review is thus pivotal in guiding both future research and current clinical practices, with the aim being to establish an international standard to integrate this technique into treatment and care pathways.
    
    
      2. What Is New in This Recommendation
      The key strength of this document, compared to previous recommendations, lies in its broader representativeness. For its development, international experts from 16 countries, representatives of mesotherapy scientific societies, were involved. In addition, specialists from various disciplines and representatives of 15 national scientific societies participated, contributing to a more multidisciplinary perspective. From the very beginning of the drafting process, representatives from four patient associations were involved. Their participation helped align the guideline with patients’ real needs and ensure it considered different care settings [5]. To eliminate biases stemming from personal beliefs and to facilitate future updates, a standardized procedure was followed in developing this recommendation [6]. The scientific process also considered unanswered questions due to a lack of data, identified debated topics, and pinpointed areas with limited scientific evidence, all aimed at shaping future research directions. The contents of this document therefore represent a starting point for applying mesotherapy and for planning further scientific research.
    
    
      3. Methods
      The Bibliographic Research Committee reviewed all Medline literature using the keyword ‘mesotherapy,’ based on which the Steering Committee selected the most relevant studies and, in consultation with patient and volunteer associations, identified 23 key clinical questions (Table 1). These questions were formulated through a process involving a literature review, patient needs, and the potential applications of mesotherapy in the various areas explored to date. Each question was submitted to a group of experts (Editorial Committee). After several rounds, the responses and related recommendations were collected. The recommendations that reached final approval were then submitted for voting by both national and international experts. The voting process included representatives from mesotherapy scientific societies in other countries (International Scientific Committee) as well as from several national scientific societies (Representatives of National Scientific Associations). The level of evidence for each recommendation was assessed using the methodology proposed by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), based on the types of studies available (Table 2). The recommendations were voted on using a 5-point Likert scale: strongly disagree (1), disagree (2), neutral (3), agree (4), strongly agree (5). The pre-established consensus threshold for a recommendation to be considered approved was set at a minimum of 70% agreement, as determined by the commission to enhance the safety and effectiveness of the methodology. After processing the expert voting results, a final document was drafted and reviewed by four external reviewers (Figure 1). It was then reviewed by four external reviewers using the AGREE quality of reporting checklist [7]. This article presents the final version of the document, as approved by the reviewers.
      
        3.1. Question 1: How Should Mesotherapy Be Defined?
        The first intracutaneous injections described for analgesic purposes date back to the mid-1800s [8].
        The term “mesotherapy” was firstly used in 1958 by Michel Pistor, who later described the method as a subcutaneous therapy useful in various clinical situations [9]. Mesotherapy spread worldwide for the treatment of numerous conditions, but it was practiced in different ways and, in some cases, considered a form of alternative medicine [10]. In 2004, Sergio Maggiori proposed the term “Local Intradermal Therapy” (LIT) to emphasize the role of injecting active ingredients into the superficial layer of the skin [11,12]. However, due to the use of injected products without a scientific rationale, the technique faced criticism, particularly when applied in dermatology [13,14]. Consequently, in 2011, the Italian Society of Mesotherapy initiated an important review process. In a first position paper, the following definition was proposed: “Minimally invasive technique based on microinjections of active ingredients into the surface layer of the skin corresponding to the area to be treated” [1]. In 2014, an international consensus revised this definition as follows: “A technique based on the administration of pharmaceutically active substances in the upper layers of the skin” [15]. In 2021, a new international consensus introduced two new definitions: “The term mesotherapy means the infiltration into the superficial layer of the skin for preventive, curative, or rehabilitative purposes” and “The term local intradermal therapy refers to a series of dermal micro deposits of products that result in their slow diffusion into the underlying tissues.” [3]. This latest position endorses the infiltration of pharmaceutically active substances and includes the now widespread use of medical devices, particularly in dermatology. Nonetheless, the term “mesotherapy” has been retained alongside the more specific term “local intradermal therapy.” In fact, mesotherapy has always been regarded as a localized treatment, and many studies have compared it with systemic therapies, whether oral or parenteral. In contrast, the subcutaneous administration of active substances should be considered a systemic parenteral treatment, commonly used in various clinical areas such as palliative care, oncology, and immunotherapy [16]. Indeed, it has already been noted that during mesotherapy, a portion of the injected drug is absorbed into the bloodstream, producing a systemic effect that adds to the local effect [3]. Future studies will be tasked with determining the roles played by the local and systemic effects resulting from mesotherapy administration [17]. In conclusion, having evaluated previous definitions, the experts strongly recommend the definitions reported in Table 3 (each such table reports the recommendation; the questions (Q) and the related answers from which the recommendations were obtained; the level of the studies considered (according to AHCPR); the mean ± SD of the score obtained from the experts’ vote; and the percentages of agreement, abstentions, and disagreement).
      
      
        3.2. Question 2: How Is Mesotherapy Performed?
        For years, the mesotherapy technique was passed down from one physician to another. Only in 2011 did a consensus of experts propose standardized recommendations for performing mesotherapy [1], suggesting the systematic use of a 4 mm long needle with a 0.4 mm gauge (27 G), or a 13 mm long needle (30 G or 32 G), with angle adjustments depending on the skin area. Each injection should contain no more than 0.1–0.2 mL of product, and microinjections should be spaced 1 to 3 cm apart. Mesotherapy involves a series of microinjections in a specific area of the skin. Injection depth has been a topic of much debate, but the highest level of consensus was reached by defining the standard injection depth as within 2 mm (Figure 2) [12,18]. A 30° angle relative to the skin surface facilitates an injection depth of approximately 2 mm. By increasing or decreasing the angle, different injection depths can be achieved. These recommendations were also intended with the objective to standardize the technique with the objective to facilitate comparisons of clinical data across studies. As a result, the use of multi-injectors is discouraged because they do not allow the physician to achieve a consistent injection depth with each needle or the precise targeting of skin points previously selected by the physician (e.g., trigger points). Furthermore, with multi-injectors it is not possible to avoid nevi or other skin lesions that should not be infiltrated. Moreover, multi-injectors do not allow microinjections to be spaced at variable distances [1]. The recommendation to inject different substances using different syringes and at different inoculation sites [3] has been strongly reaffirmed and validated during this approval process. Adherence to the aseptic technique is a fundamental recommendation to avoid the adverse events reported in the literature [19], often incorrectly attributed to mesotherapy but actually caused by a failure to follow aseptic guidelines (Table 4).
      
      
        3.3. Question 3: What Is the Mechanism of Action of Mesotherapy?
        Preclinical studies have shown that the intradermal injection of NSAIDs, anesthetics, and antibiotics results in higher and more prolonged concentrations in the tissues beneath the injection site (skin, muscles, and joints), compared to intramuscular administration. This supports the hypothesis of a persistent local pharmacological action [1,20,21,22].
        It has also been reported that the analgesic effect of mesotherapy is achieved using lower doses of medication administered at longer intervals compared to systemic (oral and parenteral) routes [23,24,25,26,27,28,29]. This includes the effect of prolonged systemic absorption due to the slow uptake from intradermal drug depots [1,8]. The most commonly used drugs for managing localized pain include anesthetics, muscle relaxants, analgesics, and anti-inflammatory agents. It is therefore possible to hypothesize that interactions with the immune system, the endorphin system [30,31,32], and the network of glial cells abundantly present in the dermis [33,34] and the participation of keratinocytes in nociceptive activity all support the hypothesis of dermal modulation triggered by mesotherapy. Some evidence suggests that the mechanical stimulation caused by multiple needle pricks may also play a role [35]. In fact, when comparing two groups of patients treated with pharmacological mesotherapy or dry needling, both treatments resulted in pain reduction [18,36]. Injection points may also influence outcomes, as some data suggest that mesotherapy applied to trigger points is more effective in reducing localized pain [37]. The local analgesic effect may partly result from tissue stretching and the chemical–physical changes induced by the injected liquid in the dermis. Mesotherapy performed with saline solution reduces pain, albeit to a lesser degree and for a shorter duration compared to mesotherapy with drugs [38,39]. Moreover, saline solution has proven to be less effective than sterile water, suggesting a different intradermal chemical–physical effect [40,41]. In a randomized study, sterile water was found to be more effective than dry needling [42], suggesting that the analgesic effect may be induced by osmotic draw and increased pressure in the tissues, which possibly activates afferent nerve fibers (A-delta and C fibers) and the gate control mechanism [43]. It should also be noted that the delayed systemic action of the injected active ingredient may prolong the effects over time and explain the reduced frequency of mesotherapy sessions (generally weekly). Finally, within such a complex system of hypotheses, a component of placebo effect must also be considered, as in any other analgesic therapy [44,45,46]. In conclusion, the local pharmacological effect, microinjections induced by the needle, the chemical–physical stimulation from the injected liquid volume, stimulation of specific trigger points, and additional neuroimmune-mediated actions all appear to contribute to the clinical response observed after mesotherapy administration. The collection of these hypothesized effects has been termed “mesodermal modulation” (Figure 3, Table 5).
      
      
        3.4. Question 4: What Is the Advantage of the Drug-Sparing Effect of the Intradermal Route in Immunoprophylaxis?
        The drug-sparing effect observed in analgesic applications through intradermal administration has also been reported in the field of immunology. Numerous studies confirm that higher antibody titers can be achieved with lower antigen doses via the intradermal route, compared to deeper administration routes [47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54]. A recent narrative review highlights the pharmacoeconomic benefits of intradermal vaccination for various pathogens, including influenza virus, rabies virus, poliovirus (PV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), diphtheria–tetanus–pertussis (DTP) bacteria, human papillomavirus (HPV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JE), meningococcus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and yellow fever virus [55] (Table 6).
      
      
        3.5. Question 5: Which Substances Are Injected?
        The choice of drugs depends on the diagnosis, and the selected active ingredients must be those approved for managing the specific condition or symptoms being treated. Drugs not authorized for the condition in question should be used only in an experimental setting, and off-label use should be limited to substances for which high-quality clinical studies already exist that demonstrate their tolerability and efficacy (3). Some drugs may not be approved for intradermal or subcutaneous use, and in such cases, the physician must follow the appropriate off-label use protocols. Several studies have been conducted using drug mixtures, showing good tolerability and efficacy. However, due to the heterogeneity of the mixtures and the lack of comparisons between individual components, it is not possible to recommend mixtures as more effective than single-drug administration. Only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) has compared the analgesic effect of mesotherapy using a single drug versus a combination of two drugs in patients with spinal pain. Both the mixture and the single-drug approach resulted in pain reduction, with no significant differences [25] (Table 7). Further studies comparing the efficacy and safety of individual drugs and/or mixtures of different drugs are recommended [17].
      
      
        3.6. Question 6: Can Mesotherapy Be Included in the Management of Patients with Localized Musculoskeletal Pain?
        The intradermal route was initially tested for analgesic purposes, and mesotherapy became widely used for this indication. However, the first review on the use of mesotherapy in treating musculoskeletal pain dates back to 2012 [23]. Some RCTs showed that mesotherapy was superior to a placebo [56] and to laser therapy combined with NSAIDs [57], and non-inferior to systemic ketoprofen plus methylprednisolone [58] for low back pain. Mesotherapy with lidocaine injected into acupuncture points proved to be more effective than lidocaine at trigger points [37], and it was also effective in treating calcific tendinitis of the shoulder using EDTA and procaine [59]. The combination of TENS and mesotherapy improved the analgesic response in cervicobrachial pain [60]. A more recent review analyzed seven studies: two on knee osteoarthritis and five on spinal pain [26]. The authors concluded that mesotherapy is well tolerated and effective in reducing both acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain. However, the treatments involved different drugs, and it was not possible to determine which was the most effective. An additional meta-analysis confirmed that mesotherapy is safe and more effective than systemic therapy for localized pain and functional limitations due to various musculoskeletal conditions [61]. Nonetheless, heterogeneity was observed in the substances used, injection techniques, associated treatments, session frequency, and number of sessions. Regarding the speed of clinical response after mesotherapy, two RCTs highlighted a relatively rapid onset compared to systemic routes. In fact, emergency room patients with low back pain treated with lidocaine, thiocolchicoside, and tenoxicam via mesotherapy showed greater improvement than those who received intravenous dexketoprofen after 15, 30, and 60 minutes and 24 hours [24]. Similarly, patients with acute trauma treated in the emergency department with tenoxicam-based mesotherapy experienced greater pain relief at 10, 30, 60, and 120 minutes compared to those who received intravenous dexketoprofen [27]. A review based on previously published studies defined mesotherapy as a viable option for managing musculoskeletal pain [3]. Two subsequent RCTs investigated its effect on knee pain. One study compared systemic administration to mesotherapy, showing similar pain reduction on the VAS at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, but mesotherapy scored higher on the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and the Persian version of the WOMAC index [62]. A second study compared patients with gonarthrosis treated with mesotherapy using a drug mixture to a group treated with saline solution. Both groups improved, but the drug mixture group exhibited significantly better outcomes at 8 and 16 weeks [63]. An analysis of the available data shows that authors tend to manage localized pain with mesotherapy using primarily NSAIDs, anesthetics, and muscle relaxants, which appear to offer clinical benefit at lower doses than those required for systemic administration. In RCTs, NSAIDs and anesthetics have been used alone or in combination, but combinations have not been directly compared to the individual components. No conclusion can therefore be drawn in favor of combinations over single drugs. For the same reason, conclusions cannot be made regarding the various mixtures used. Some features of mesotherapy that have particularly appealed to patients include the lower drug doses required to achieve therapeutic goals and the reduced frequency of administration (typically weekly). This is supported by findings in several studies (Table 8).
        It should be noted that the intradermal injection of saline solution also leads to pain reduction, albeit to a lesser extent than with drugs [38,39,70], and that sterile water is more effective than isotonic solution [64,71] or needle puncture alone [42]. This suggests that mesotherapy performed with saline solution or sterile water should not be considered a placebo when compared to other treatments. The use of mesotherapy during childbirth deserves specific attention. A systematic review on the use of intradermal or subcutaneous injections for contraction pain and back pain during labor has explored the topic [72]. Seven studies (involving 766 patients) were considered: four used the intradermal route, two the subcutaneous route, and one used both routes. The authors concluded that there is limited conclusive evidence supporting the effectiveness of injectable sterile water for labor pain. However, in a randomized controlled trial involving 168 patients, intradermal injections of sterile water were found to be superior to needle puncture alone in managing severe labor-related back pain at 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after administration. Randomized controlled clinical trials are warranted to evaluate not only the clinical effectiveness but also the economic benefits, as lower doses and reduced frequency of administration are factors that contribute to greater patient satisfaction (Table 9).
      
      
        3.7. Question 7: Can Mesotherapy Be Integrated into the Individual Rehabilitation Plan (IRP)?
        The role of mesotherapy in rehabilitation is closely linked to its ability to reduce pain, whether acute, subacute, or chronic. Given the numerous studies in this area, it is entirely plausible that better pain control facilitates the earlier and more effective implementation of rehabilitation therapy [23]. A review of seven studies (see blue section of Table 8) concluded that “mesotherapy showed a good effect to reduce acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain and, also, it is a well-tolerated treatment” [26]. A 2021 consensus reported that “mesotherapy can be considered in the individual path of rehabilitation” [3]. Following this review, an observational case–control study of 78 patients assessed the efficacy of mesotherapy combined with rehabilitation exercise in patients with fibromyalgia. All patients underwent a rehabilitation program including exercise + TENS + CO2 laser and received mesotherapy either with diclofenac + thiocolchicoside + mepivacaine (treatment group) or saline solution (placebo group). Both groups experienced significant pain reduction, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), although the improvement was more marked in the group treated with active drugs. A significant reduction in the Neck Disability Index (NDI) and improvement in quality of life (measured with SF-12) was also observed in the group treated with mesotherapy using active drugs. The authors state that the treatment “is a safe and effective procedure in the management of neck pain in fibromyalgia patients in the short term, regarding pain reduction, functional recovery, and quality of life” [69]. Mesotherapy has also been proposed as part of an integrated rehabilitation approach for Web Axillary Pain Syndrome [73], and in comparison with TENS, it showed a reduction in analgesic consumption [74] (Table 10).
      
      
        3.8. Question 8: Can Sports Injuries Benefit from Mesotherapy?
        Localized pain, muscle contracture, and reduced joint function are frequent symptoms in sports-related injuries. For this reason, mesotherapy is applied in the fields of exercise and sports medicine as well as in the rehabilitation of athletes. Among the most reported benefits are shortened functional recovery times and pain reduction, achieved with a relatively small number of weekly sessions, which help facilitate rehabilitation and improve athlete compliance (Table 11).
        Over the years, various pharmacological strategies have been used; however, it is important to emphasize that, although mesotherapy relies on the local action of drugs injected through a series of microinjections, systemic absorption, albeit delayed, must also be considered. Some of the substances used in mesotherapy practice are included in the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) list, particularly corticosteroids. WADA provides details on minimum washout periods, which for local injections range from 3 to 10 days [83]. Since no specific studies are available to establish the washout period for corticosteroids administered via mesotherapy, it is necessary to follow the same washout periods as that for intramuscular administration. Considering the evidence supporting pain management and rehabilitation applications, the use of mesotherapy in managing athletes after sports injuries is plausible, although strong evidence and high-quality studies are still lacking (Table 11).
      
      
        3.9. Question 9: Can Mesotherapy Be Included in the Care Pathway for the Signs and Symptoms of Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) and the Prevention of Its Complications (PEFS)?
        The term chronic venous disease (CVD) refers to “morphological and functional abnormalities of the venous system of long duration, manifesting with symptoms and/or signs that require investigation and/or care” [84]. It is classified using the CEAP system (Clinical–Etiology–Anatomy–Pathophysiology) [85], and it refers to pathological hemodynamic alterations in the lower limbs that cause a wide range of symptoms and signs (telangiectasias, reticular veins, varicose veins, skin changes, and chronic venous leg ulcers). Vascular changes in CVD also contribute to the pathophysiology of edematous-fibrosclerotic panniculopathy (PEFS) through the deposition of altered glycosaminoglycans on the capillary walls, resulting in increased capillary–venular permeability and fluid leakage into the dermis. Persistent edema, vascular congestion, and tissue hypoxia promote the thickening and increase in number of interlobular septa in the dermis and adipose tissue, leading to the appearance of depressed skin areas due to disrupted dermal architecture, hallmark signs of PEFS [86]. A linear correlation has been described between venous stasis symptoms and signs in chronic venous disease (CVD) of the lower limbs and those of PEFS (heaviness, pain, cramps, edema, telangiectasias) [87]. Recent guidelines recommend conservative management in symptomatic CVD (C0–C5), and while awaiting eventual surgical intervention [84]. An expert consensus recommends initiating treatment even before clinical signs appear, to slow the progression and improve the quality of life [88]. The rationale for using mesotherapy in CVD and PEFS was clinically tested as early as the 1980s (data on file of SIM regarding 1,041 patients studied in open-label or retrospective studies). More recently, several clinical studies have further explored the role of mesotherapy in treating venous insufficiency of the lower limbs, using active ingredients with antithrombotic, profibrinolytic, and anti-inflammatory properties [89,90]. Additional recent findings have confirmed the utility of intradermal therapy in managing the subjective symptoms and clinical signs of PEFS [91,92]. As proposed in two different consensus statements [1,15], it has thus been suggested that CVD should be managed with standard systemic treatments combined with local mesotherapy, specifically applied to areas affected by microcirculatory alterations, to improve microcirculation and reduce both symptoms and functional limitations. While awaiting further data to assess the medium- and long-term efficacy, the management of CVD and PEFS may potentially benefit from mesotherapy. However, it should be applied based on an algorithm tailored to the clinical and instrumental response of the individual patient (Figure 4).
        Weekly mesotherapy sessions may become biweekly and eventually monthly once results are achieved and documented through objective and instrumental parameters, and a regular weekly follow-up is necessary to evaluate both the efficacy and tolerability of the treatment. Mesotherapy should be considered as an add-on to the systemic treatment of chronic venous insufficiency in the lower limbs (Table 12).
      
      
        3.10. Question 10. Can Mesotherapy Be Considered in Dermatology?
        Mesotherapy is a particularly interesting technique in dermatology because the target organ is directly the skin and the lesion to be treated. Certain skin reactions induced by the mesotherapy technique, collectively referred to as mesodermal modulation, suggest an enhancement of local pharmacological action when a product is deposited in the dermis (e.g., increased primary and secondary immune response, analgesic effects induced by microtrauma, and amplification of the injected drug’s mechanism of action) [8,93,94]. In 2020, after reviewing the various dermatological applications of mesotherapy (Table 13), the authors concluded the following: “The dermis appears to be a target organ for many pathologies and clinical dermatologists will play a crucial role in the development of mesotherapy.” “Mesotherapy applied in dermatology needs more clinical confirmation. Studies are needed to identify the ideal drug concentration, the depth of infiltration, and the patients who benefit most from this technique” [93]. In clinical practice, certain conditions seem to benefit more from mesotherapy, such as hair loss [95], alopecia [96,97], and melasma management [98,99] (Table 14). However, it should be noted that, in some dermatologic conditions, treatment has primarily been intra-lesional, such as in acne [100], keloids [101], warts [102], and others. In dermatology, not all studied agents have been approved by regulatory authorities for the indications under investigation. The off-label use of such products is therefore subject to national regulations in each country.
      
      
        3.11. Question 11: Can Mesotherapy Be Proposed for Managing Skin Aging?
        The term skin aging refers to various alterations resulting from changes in connective tissue and fibroblasts, leading to the loss of elasticity, wrinkles, telangiectasias, and actinic keratosis [103,104]. Some medical devices have been used intradermally with the goal of promoting hydration, proliferation, migration, and cellular reorganization, and to prevent chrono- and photoaging [105]. Some data suggest improvements in skin appearance and quality (reduction in fine wrinkles, increased hydration, turgor, elasticity, and firmness) [106,107,108]. However, due to the lack of histological results, it is not currently possible to draw conclusions about the long-term efficacy and tolerability of these products [109]. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has also provided some positive data [110], but these procedures have not received favorable opinions from some national authorities [111,112]. In esthetic medicine, product mixtures have been used in the belief they would yield better results. However, a recent review has reported that individual products may be more effective than mixtures [113]. Even in the dermo-esthetic field, therapeutic decisions should therefore be based on a risk/benefit assessment according to the clinical diagnosis, considering ethical and clinical research findings free from conflicts of interest [114] (Table 15).
      
      
        3.12. Question 12: How Can Adverse Events Reported in the Literature Be Prevented?
        
          
            Like any other technique, mesotherapy may cause three types of adverse events:
          
          
            Events caused by the microtrauma produced by the needle (e.g., mild pain at the injection site and bruising) [115];
          
          
            Those caused by the product or mixtures injected (e.g., local and systemic reactions) [116,117,118];
          
        
        Those caused by noncompliance with hygiene standards or malpractice (e.g., improper execution, wrong drug selection, lack of sterilization of the environment or skin, and failure to use sterile disposable equipment) [119,120,121].
        Over the years, various substances have been used, including allopathic, homeopathic, herbal products, and medical devices, often in combination, particularly for dermo-esthetic purposes. However, it should be noted that not all products used are approved for such purposes or for intradermal/subcutaneous use, so any adverse event should be recorded and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities, even in the case of treatments performed for esthetic purposes [19] (Table 16).
      
      
        3.13. Question 13: Can Mesotherapy Technique Be Applied to the Oral Mucosa?
        Mesotherapy has also been used for the management of gingival hyperpigmentation [122,123,124,125]. However, due to the profound anatomical and functional differences between skin and oral mucosa, the use of the term “mesotherapy” in dentistry is not straightforward: many of the mechanisms of action hypothesized for mesotherapy on the skin may not function in the same way on oral mucosa. The infiltration technique, when applied to the oral mucosa, appears promising based on currently available data, but only future RCTs will facilitate a better understanding of the role of this infiltration technique in the oral region (Table 17).
      
      
        3.14. Questions 14 and 15: Can Mesotherapy Be Part of a Multimodal Treatment Strategy? What Treatment Algorithm Is Recommended for the Application of Mesotherapy?
        Mesotherapy has been used in combination with TENS, laser therapy, rehabilitation exercises, and various systemic analgesic treatments [23,69,126]. A synergistic effect has also been described in dermatology for the treatment of melasma [98,127], the management of alopecia [95], and acne [128]. The benefit of combining two different therapeutic strategies is enhanced by mesotherapy, since it uses lower drug dosages and reduces recovery times [3,23,26,129]. Mesotherapy may therefore be considered in the therapeutic pathway for one of the most sought-after advantages by practicing physicians: the reduction in potential drug interactions and the use of the minimum effective dose. As a result, the combination of a local treatment like mesotherapy with a systemic treatment, appropriately tailored to the patient’s needs, can represent a recommended strategy, especially in patients at risk of drug interactions (such as the elderly, poly-treated patients, or those with chronic conditions) [130]. In the management of chronic musculoskeletal pain, mesotherapy may be synergistic with other therapeutic strategies, as it not only reduces the systemic dose of analgesics but also improves treatment acceptance. To this end, an algorithm has been proposed to guide the treatment pathway for individual patients, allowing combined treatments with mesotherapy and other therapeutic strategies to be considered (Figure 5). Possible future interactions with other complementary techniques, such as acupuncture, should be studied.
      
      
        3.15. Question 16: When Can Mesotherapy Be Applied in Clinical Practice?
        Mesotherapy is a technique that can be used for preventive, curative, or rehabilitative purposes in an individualized care pathway, in association with other therapies, either pharmacological or non-pharmacological, or on its own when other proven options have failed or cannot be used, or when no other therapeutic options are available. This is particularly applicable to patients who have undergone a medical examination from which there is a rationale for localized treatment [1]. The choice of the product to be injected should be based on its tolerability and efficacy, which justify its use, and should only be administered after obtaining valid informed consent [3] (Table 18).
      
      
        3.16. Question 17: Are There Clinical Conditions That Contraindicate Mesotherapy?
        The intracutaneous administration technique involves a microtrauma induced by the needle. Conditions that cause significant coagulation defects or the use of anticoagulant medications may therefore lead to prolonged bleeding and the formation of hematomas resulting from the needle insertion [1]. The presence of autoimmune diseases, a tendency to develop hypertrophic or keloid scars, active herpes infections, ongoing therapies that can modify cutaneous repair processes, the presence of permanent fillers at the injection sites, and allergic diathesis are contraindications for mesotherapy. These should therefore be investigated in the patient’s medical history to assess the risk/benefit ratio of mesotherapy. The injection of a drug involves systemic absorption, so the contraindications of the injected drugs should also be considered [3]. These and other ethical considerations are listed in Table 19.
      
      
        3.17. Question 18: Is a Specific Informed Consent Required for Mesotherapy?
        Only after being properly informed can the patient knowingly participate in the treatment pathway and more accurately assess the risk/benefit ratio and the results achievable. In the doctor–patient relationship, with the support of informed consent, the patient is encouraged to evaluate the risk/benefit ratio throughout the entire treatment process [131]. As with any other treatment, the patient must also be informed about the various therapeutic options available and the risks of each. The patient must be properly informed, even when using active ingredients not approved for intradermal or subcutaneous routes; off-label use must also be shared with the patient [132]. It is therefore advisable to keep a written record of the consent obtained (Table 19).
      
      
        3.18. Question 19: Is It Necessary to Report the Effects of Mesotherapy in the Patient’s Medical Chart?
        Recording clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic parameters is considered good clinical practice [133]. Completing the medical chart (whether paper or digital) holds ethical and medico-legal value and facilitates the retrospective review of clinical data through audits [134]. For example, in Italy, according to Law No. 38 of 15 March 2010, physicians are required to complete the medical chart, periodically documenting pain levels and results obtained from treatments [1] (Table 19).
      
      
        3.19. Question 20. Can Mesotherapy Be Performed on Minors?
        Many active ingredients have not been approved for use in pediatric patients [135]. Mesotherapy in pediatrics is not routine, and limited data in this age group are available [136,137,138,139]. Additionally, skin thickness in pediatric patients is significantly different from adults [139], making it challenging to apply results obtained in adults to pediatric patients. However, in pediatric patients, the micro-needle-based drug delivery technique has been considered to bypass the oral route for medications that pediatric patients cannot swallow [140,141]. Considering its analgesic effect, needle puncture alone may be a viable option in pediatric patients, depending on the pain it elicits. In fact, some data seem to encourage research on acupuncture in certain clinical situations in pediatrics [142] (Table 19).
      
      
        3.20. Question 21: Who Can Practice Mesotherapy
        Mesotherapy is a medical procedure that must be performed exclusively by qualified and licensed physicians. As it involves the injection of pharmacological agents into the skin, it constitutes a clinical act that requires full medical responsibility, including diagnosis, treatment planning, administration, and follow-up. These responsibilities carry medical, ethical, and legal implications and cannot be delegated to non-medical personnel. Worldwide, the practice of mesotherapy should fall within the professional scope of physicians—both specialists and general practitioners—who have received specific training and demonstrated clinical competence in this technique. Its application in patient care must be conducted under medical supervision to ensure safety, therapeutic effectiveness, and adherence to current scientific evidence and clinical guidelines. General practitioners, particularly those managing pain, dermatological conditions, and chronic diseases, may implement mesotherapy effectively when properly trained. Ongoing education and strict compliance with evidence-based protocols are essential to maintain high standards of care and to minimize the risk of inappropriate use. This statement proposes a universal framework for training and practice, supporting the safe and effective integration of mesotherapy into evidence-based medical care across diverse healthcare systems.
      
      
        3.21. Question 22: What Is the Role of Research?
        The evidence supporting mesotherapy as a route of administration is abundant, as demonstrated by the increase in scientific publications on the topic. However, many aspects remain unclear, and rigorous studies are still needed. Only through this approach will it be possible to complete the transition towards evidence-based mesotherapy [8]. The priority research areas are summarized in Table 20.
        Some preclinical animal studies have confirmed that mesotherapy induces cell-mediated actions in the dermis, which enhance the local pharmacological action [1,143,144]. The dermis may therefore represent the target for new local and systemic therapies [93]. It is currently believed that more superficial inoculation, within a depth of 2 mm, facilitates a slower diffusion of the drug into the underlying tissues. However, further studies are needed to precisely identify the correct inoculation depth. Finally, it is urgent to study the medium- and long-term effects of dermo-esthetic products introduced to the market. In this area of application, the benefit of each product should be compared with placebos, using validated scales. This would facilitate transparent communication with the patient regarding the real possibilities of the injected product. In addition to preclinical and clinical research, it is particularly useful to identify the potential economic benefit of mesotherapy through Health Technology Assessment (HTA) methodologies. Indeed, the economic impact of mesotherapy, when applied according to standard criteria, has been positive [145]. Calibrated audits, based on patient needs, will also help identify the best care pathways (Table 21).
      
      
        3.22. Question 23: What Do Patients Recommend?
        The involvement of patient associations has helped identify several areas of discussion, leading to the development of specific recommendations (Table 22). The time spent to fully align the treatment pathway was considered a fundamental part of the medical consultation and essential to obtaining valid informed consent [131]. It is becoming clear that the doctor’s experience alone is not sufficient to ensure the safety of a particular treatment, and evidence of tolerability and efficacy is necessary. This issue carries significant medico-legal implications, particularly in the context of mesotherapy procedures supported by insufficient or emerging evidence.
      
    
    
      4. Potential Impact of the Guideline on Care Pathways
      Mesotherapy, in some of its applications, meets the criteria of essential care, avoiding enormous costs and improving the management of certain symptoms. In fact, a pharmacoeconomic analysis conducted to evaluate the resource absorption in patients starting treatment with systemic NSAIDs showed a saving for the Healthcare System generated by locoregional infiltrations [145]. If mesotherapy were integrated into LEA, certain populations would benefit from it, for example, patients with chronic pain, elderly patients, and those on polytherapy at high risk for pharmacological interactions. In these patient subgroups, localized treatment could lead to clinical benefits and an improvement in the quality of life, with significant savings in medications. Obviously, the economic impact of mesotherapy, due to its drug-sparing effect, should be measured in each country, where costs and healthcare pathways may differ significantly. For the same clinical effect, patient satisfaction and the reduced time spent by healthcare providers using mesotherapy should also be considered.
    
    
      5. Emerging Recommendations
      It is 50 years since the Italian Society of Mesotherapy was founded, and the first consensus on its fundamental principles has been reached. This document emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between superficial (intradermal) mesotherapy and deeper injection techniques. It excludes procedures such as “scarification” from the definition of mesotherapy and proposes dry needling as a comparator to evaluate the effects of micro-punctures versus micro-injections.
      Key procedural variables—such as needle type, insertion angle, injection depth, the number and spacing of micro-injections, dose per site, and total volume injected—are now recognized as critical to understanding mesotherapy’s mechanisms of action and assessing its clinical benefits. While its primary effect is local and pharmacological, additional immune and systemic interactions contribute to a drug-sparing effect when compared to systemic administration. 
      These insights broaden the clinical relevance of mesotherapy in pain management, rehabilitation, and sports medicine. In the latter, the potential systemic absorption of injected substances raises concerns regarding anti-doping compliance, making drug selection—based on diagnosis, tolerability, efficacy, and regulatory status—critically important. Mesotherapy should never be guided by personal beliefs, but by a sound clinical rationale.
      Mesotherapy represents a valuable therapeutic option, especially for patients requiring reduced drug exposure—such as the elderly, polymedicated individuals, and those at high risk of drug interactions or intolerance to conventional therapies. Whether used alone or as an adjunct, it may improve treatment adherence. In phlebology and dermatology, it is an established adjuvant technique, with procedural choices guided by diagnosis and the characteristics of available products. In esthetic dermatology, its application must be grounded in demonstrated efficacy and safety.
      Crucially, mesotherapy must be preceded by a thorough medical examination to rule out contraindications and establish a clear therapeutic rationale. Strict adherence to aseptic techniques is mandatory, as any deviation may constitute malpractice. As with all infiltrative procedures, mesotherapy requires a careful benefit/risk assessment involving the patient. Ethical and legal responsibilities include comprehensive documentation, obtaining valid informed consent, and ensuring that the procedure is performed exclusively by qualified medical professionals. While these practices may seem self-evident, they are fundamental to guaranteeing safe and appropriate care. Notably, “oral mesotherapy” was the only topic that failed to achieve 70% expert consensus, with 34% of participants abstaining—underscoring the need for further investigation in this area. Nevertheless, preliminary studies suggest that mucosal tissues may also benefit from infiltration using mesotherapy techniques.
      No significant differences emerged between national and international expert opinions, reinforcing the global applicability of the recommendations. Although some may view them as either overly stringent or too general, the rigorous methodology employed (7)—rooted in expert consensus and existing literature—supports the reliability of these evidence-based standards in guiding both clinical and policy decisions. Mesotherapy can now be justifiably integrated into prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation pathways.
    
    
      6. Limitations of This Document
      Despite the number of studies examined, the quality of some of them did not allow us to draw strong conclusions. However, the broad multidisciplinary consensus and methodological rigor have allowed this limitation to be partially overcome.
    
    
      7. Conclusions
      Mesotherapy has the potential to be integrated into routine clinical practice, particularly for selected patient groups—such as older adults, individuals with musculoskeletal pain, chronic venous insufficiency, and certain dermatologic conditions. The failure or low efficacy of traditional therapies prompts the inclusion of complementary techniques in patient care processes, especially in pain medicine. Scientific societies and health authorities are encouraged to address current gaps in evidence and assess the risks linked to the off-label use of mesotherapy products, especially regarding safety and ethical implications. Advancing the field will require high-quality research—particularly randomized controlled trials—that can establish mesotherapy as a standardized evidence-based intervention. This goal could be supported through targeted public and private investment, thus helping to avoid redundant or low-impact studies.

Title: A Recalcitrant Case of Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Successful Combination of Biologic, Antibiotic, and Surgical Therapy

Abstract: AbstractIntroductionHidradenitis suppurativa (HS), or acne inversa, is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that leads to painful nodules, abscesses, and fistulas.Case PresentationThis case describes the treatment of a 49-year-old male patient with progressive and massively inflamed HS for 20 years who also suffered from heart failure (NYHA II–III, EF 35–40%) and hypochromic microcytic anaemia (Hb 7.8 g/dL). Upon presentation, he was suffering from fatigue and severe pain (8–9/10, NRS). Due to prolonged immobility, knee and hip joint contractures with extension deficits were present. At the initial presentation, communicating, and purulent sinus tracts were observed bilaterally from the gluteal to femoral region and perianal area. Hurley score III, HS-PGA score: very severe, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score: 19, ISH4 score: severe (16). Under adalimumab s.c. 40 mg/week combined with clindamycin (300 mg bd), the condition had worsened. The patient was admitted to the hospital for i.v. administration of ertapenem 1 g/day for 14 days in preparation for sinus tract resection. With an Hb level of 7.8 g/dL, the patient received iron carboxymaltose and erythropoietin. After a significant reduction in inflammatory markers (leukocytes 17.11/nL to 7.42/nL), a large excision of the sinus tracts was performed bilaterally in the gluteal region and left femoral area. Following 4 weeks of wound granulation, split-thickness skin grafting was performed. The knee and hip joint contractures improved with intensive physiotherapy. After surgery, the patient received antibiotic therapy with clindamycin, rifampicin, and metronidazole (clindamycin 600 mg, rifampicin 300 mg, metronidazole 500 mg, each p.o. 2×/day). In parallel, anti-inflammatory therapy with secukinumab 300 mg s.c. twice a month was initiated. Over the following 3 months, no progression or recurrence occurred. Quality of life and pain levels improved significantly under the therapy (DLQI from 19 to 10, pain from 8 to 9 to 3/10 NRS).ConclusionIn extensive cases of HS, a combination of surgical and conservative therapy is necessary. We demonstrate that severe cases can be successfully treated with a combination of antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and surgical therapy.

Body: Introduction
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the apocrine glands, mainly affecting axillae, inguinal, and perianal areas. Patients suffer from recurrent inflammatory episodes, leading to the formation of painful nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts, and scars. The disease has a severe impact on the quality of life due to psychosocial distress, pain and mobility restrictions [1, 2].
      This case report shows a male patient battling a severe form of HS for over 20 years with underlying comorbidities. A combination of biologic, antibiotic, and surgical therapy was necessary to treat this recalcitrant case of HS. The aim of this report was to highlight the necessity of a combination of systemic and surgical treatment for advanced HS.
    
    
      Case Report
      In January 2024, a 49-year-old male presented with a 20-year-long history of HS. Over multiple years, his condition had worsened. Upon presentation, he showed extensive fistulas and abscesses in the gluteal, femoral, and perianal regions with emphasis of the left side (Fig. 1a). There were extensive scars in both axillae after previous surgery and sinus tracts in atypical regions: on his abdomen, chest, on his lower right leg and behind both ears. His most recent treatment included 8 months of adalimumab 40 mg s.c. weekly and 3 months of oral clindamycin 300 mg bd and resulted in a further deterioration of his clinical status. Also, his comorbidities including heart failure (NYHA II-III, ejection fraction 35–40%) and hypochromic microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 7.8 g/dL) had not been addressed yet.

      The long-lasting inflammation of the skin had caused limited mobility with a restriction of movement of the left hip and contracture of the left knee: both joints could not be extended fully anymore. Moreover, he suffered from extreme fatigue and significant pain (NRS 8–9/10). His Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score showed a significant deterioration with a result of 19. In total, he presented himself with a case of Hurley stage III HS, an HS-PGA score of very severe disease and an International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4) score of 16.
      The patient showed extensive bilateral gluteal and femoral sinus tracts, with a particularly large sinus tract measuring 40 cm in diameter on his left buttocks. All fistulas were actively purulent and malodorous. His blood work showed elevated inflammatory markers, with leukocytes at 17.11/nL. Considering the failure of past systemic therapies, we implemented a new strategy focused on control of the inflammation, and surgical excision of the permanently damaged tissue.
      After hospitalization, we started an intravenous treatment with ertapenem 1 g daily for 14 days to downregulate the inflammation (Fig. 1a–c). Parallelly, the patient received iron carboxymaltose (500 mg FerApplic i.v.) and erythropoietin (20,000 IU s.c.) to treat his anaemia. After a few days, the clinical signs of inflammation improved and the patient’s inflammatory blood markers had decreased significantly, with leukocytes dropping to 7.42/nL.
      After addressing the overall inflammation and the comorbidities, the patient underwent extensive excision of the sinus tracts and scar tissue of the gluteal region and the left femoral area. The surgery was performed under general anaesthesia in combination with tumescence anaesthesia. Subsequently, the wounds were rinsed daily, and calcium alginate was applied in order to advance secondary intention healing until the granulation tissue was sufficient to be covered by a skin graft (Fig. 2a–c).

      Transfusion of two units of red blood cells, as well as infusion of iron carboxymaltose (500 mg FerApplic i.v.) and erythropoietin (20,000 IU s.c.), was necessary postoperatively in order to treat the coexisting anaemia. Four weeks after the excision of sinus tracts, we performed a split skin graft transplantation. The patients’ immobility caused by knee contractures was improved by daily physiotherapy.
      Following intravenous antibiotic treatment with ertapenem, we applied a combination of oral clindamycin 600 mg, rifampicin 300 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg, twice daily for 4 weeks to prevent the recurrence of inflammation. Within 3 months, the patient showed a significant improvement in pain levels (8–9/10 to 3/10) and in quality of life (DLQI score improved from 19 to 10). Furthermore, the surgical wounds healed successfully. Further surgical treatment was necessary for the atypically located sinus tracts (retroauricular, lower leg, chest). One year after surgery, there were no signs of further progression or recurrence of the disease.
    
    
      Discussion
      Severe cases of HS pose a significant treatment challenge for dermatologists. The goal of this case report was to highlight several important aspects of handling such complex cases.
      Management in this case relied on a multimodal approach, addressing both the inflammation and the irreparable tissue damage following a long-lasting and insufficiently treated course of the disease. The recently published version of the European HS guidelines differentiates between inflammatory cases of HS and non-inflammatory cases: the first should be treated with medical therapy while the latter requires a surgical approach [3]. In cases with both inflammation and irreparable tissue damage, a combination treatment is necessary.
      In our patient’s case, a key part of the therapeutic strategy was the combination of antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and surgical interventions, each targeting a distinct aspect of the disease pathophysiology. Intravenous ertapenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem, was administered to reduce the bacterial load typical of HS lesions, particularly anaerobic and gram-negative organisms. This allowed for better local control of infection before surgical excision. Postoperatively, oral clindamycin and rifampicin were continued due to their synergistic effect in targeting biofilm-associated bacteria. Metronidazole was added to enhance anaerobic coverage and support anti-inflammatory effects.
      In parallel, secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-17, was initiated to suppress the chronic inflammatory pathway central to HS. IL-17 is a key cytokine driving neutrophilic inflammation and tissue destruction in HS. Blocking IL-17 helps reduce inflammatory cell recruitment and contributes to long-term disease control [4, 5].
      Additionally, erythropoietin and intravenous iron carboxymaltose were administered to treat anaemia, which likely impaired wound healing and contributed to fatigue. Finally, radical surgical excision of the sinus tracts removed the chronically inflamed and irreparably damaged tissue and created a foundation for subsequent wound granulation and successful grafting. Healing by secondary intention ensured that residual infection could be adequately managed before definitive closure [3, 6, 7].
      The IL-17 inhibitor secukinumab played a significant role in maintaining the patient’s remission post-surgery. Choosing an appropriate systemic therapy is a crucial factor in achieving and sustaining long-term disease control in patients with refractory HS [8, 9].
    
    
      Conclusion
      HS is a complex chronic inflammatory skin condition that requires an individualized and often multimodal treatment approach. Therapeutic options include topical and systemic antibiotics, hormonal therapy, retinoids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologics such as TNF-α or IL-17 inhibitors. In advanced stages with irreparable tissue damage, surgical intervention becomes necessary to achieve long-term control.
      This case demonstrates that a combination of antibiotic therapy, surgical excision, and anti-inflammatory treatment with IL-17 blockade can successfully induce remission in severe HS. Importantly, biologics such as secukinumab offer a promising long-term treatment option, especially in patients with refractory disease. Their role has become increasingly relevant in the broader therapeutic landscape, as highlighted by recent literature discussing patient management in complex situations, including during COVID-19 vaccination campaigns [6].
      Dermatologists should consider a stepwise, patient-centred strategy that combines available therapies according to disease severity, prior response to treatments, and patient comorbidities [1, 9]. Further research is needed to optimize the sequencing and combination of these therapies to improve long-term outcomes in HS patients.
    
    
      Statement of Ethics

Title: Shame and disgust in patients with inflammatory skin diseases: a systematic review of psychological correlates and psychotherapeutic approaches

Abstract: IntroductionSkin diseases are among the most common diseases worldwide and can cause severe psychological and social impairments. Negative self-directed emotions like shame and disgust may be important in the development and progression of these diseases, and thus, patients may benefit from psychotherapeutic approaches targeting shame and self-disgust. The first aim of this systematic review is to investigate the existing literature regarding shame and disgust as psychological correlates of inflammatory skin diseases. The second aim is to review the existing literature concerning the evidence of the efficacy of mindfulness-based and compassion-based therapy for alleviating shame and self-disgust in the context of skin diseases.MethodsTherefore, we carried out a systematic literature review via the databases PubMed, Web of Science and PSYINDEX.Results46 manuscripts were included in this review. Research shows that acne vulgaris, psoriasis, and atopic eczema are accompanied by a severe psychosocial burden, shame, and self-disgust, often due to highly visible skin lesions in affected patients. The use of mindfulness-based and compassion-based approaches is already being studied to address the experiences of shame and disgust due to these diseases, and initial promising results indicate that they can be considered beneficial in the holistic therapy of skin diseases.DiscussionThis systematic review shows that skin disorders have a significant psychosocial impact, leading to shame and self-disgust, especially due to the manifestation of visible skin lesions in affected patients. Mindfulness- and compassion-based approaches are currently being studied as potential treatments for the psychosocial impacts of skin diseases, and show promising results in addressing affected patients’ psychological burden.

      1 Introduction
      Skin diseases, including fungal skin diseases, other skin and subcutaneous conditions, and acne, ranked among the top ten most common diseases worldwide in 2010 (1). In a study involving 90,880 employees conducted from 2004 to 2009, 3.9% had acne vulgaris, 2% had psoriasis, and 1.3% had atopic eczema (2), making these inflammatory dermatological conditions three of the most prevalent skin diseases. A British report revealed that 14% of surveyed dermatological patients reported that their skin conditions were exacerbated by psychological factors, while 85% noted that the interference with their social relationships was the most distressing aspect of their illness (3). Importantly, the study highlighted a notably higher suicide rate among patients with inflammatory skin diseases, surpassing that in the general population (4). 17% of surveyed dermatological patients required psychotherapeutic treatment (3).
      
        1.1 The emotional consequences of skin diseases: disgust and shame
        Rook and Wilkinson (5) already argued in the late 1970s that “[.] the role of emotional factors on diseases of the skin is of such significance that, if they are ignored, the effective management of at least 40% of the patients attending departments of dermatology is impossible” (6). From an evolutionary standpoint, Kellett and Gilbert (7) center their focus on self-related negative emotions like shame and disgust. Their bio-psycho-social model, as depicted in Figure 1, serves as the foundation for this systematic review. They argue that acne’s development and progression stem from a combination of genetic factors and the stressors of puberty. The authors propose that when acne symptoms become prominent, individuals experience negative thoughts and emotions, especially related to the self, along with social challenges. These internal struggles and interpersonal issues adversely affect mood, behavior, and immune system function, further impacting stress levels, acne symptoms, and the emergence of additional psychological problems. The bio-psycho-social model of acne (Figure 1) can also be applied to the clinical presentation of psoriasis and atopic eczema, as all three conditions involve inflammatory skin issues that can negatively impact social life, emotional and psychological wellbeing. The connection of stress, social factors, and negative emotions with skin diseases is supported by evidence (6, 8), while a systematic review on shame and self-disgust in skin diseases is lacking.

        The basic human emotion of disgust is described as a form of rejection that arises from the need to distance oneself from a contaminated stimulus and is characterized by feelings of nausea and revulsion (9). Disgust is considered to be an adaptive emotion, which is an evolved response to objects in the environment that pose a (perceived) threat in terms of contagion through infectious diseases (10). Self-disgust describes feelings of reluctance and repulsion directed against specific aspects of one’s own person (11), whereas (general) shame is believed to be an incapacitating emotion that is accompanied by the feeling of being small, inferior, and of “shrinking,” whereby the self, as a whole, is devalued and considered to be inadequate, incompetent, and worthless (12). Shame is viewed from a more differentiated perspective, and a distinction is made between external and internal shame. External shame refers to the experience of the self as existing negatively in the minds of others, and thus as having visible deficits, failures, or mistakes (13). Internal shame, by contrast, is linked to the inner dynamics of the self and one’s judgements and evaluations (13). The distinction between shame and embarrassment is debated, with researchers suggesting distinctions in terms of intensity of affect, severity of transgression or patterns of attribution to the presented (embarrassment) vs. the core (shame) self (14). However, despite empirical evidence for their distinctness (15, 16), shame and embarrassment are not always distinguished unequivocally, and, as a result, when many researchers speak of embarrassment, it is more accurate to think of shame (17).
        Shame in the context of skin disease may arise from the experience of stigma (18). Stigma refers both to social reactions to attributes seen as degrading or devaluating (e.g., blemished skin), and to the internalization of such devaluation, termed self-stigma (19). Self-stigma and shame are thus closely related, both involving the devaluation of self, and are sometimes used interchangeably (20, 21). The impacts of stigma in skin diseases have been reviewed elsewhere (18, 22), whereas shame and self-stigma have not been investigated separately in skin diseases.
        Kellett and Gilbert (7) also explore the impact of social difficulties and the importance of attractiveness on body shame reactions. In the context of body shame reactions, Gilbert (13) defines it as shame related to one’s own body, particularly concerning skin. In society, clear skin is idealized as a feature of “desirable individuals” (p. 10), and blemished or diseased skin can be perceived as a sign of poor overall health. Consequently, those affected may fear eliciting negative emotions like fear, anger, or disgust in others, potentially diminishing their desirability in various aspects, notably sexually.
        Despite the importance of shame and self-disgust for the connections between social challenges, wellbeing, and symptom exacerbation posited in the bio-psycho-social model, the influence of these emotions on the wellbeing and treatment of individuals with skin disorders has received limited attention. Thus, this paper’s primary goal is to review existing literature, specifically focusing on the evidence supporting shame and self-disgust as psychological consequences and potential enhancers of inflammatory skin diseases. Reviewing the evidence will help identify gaps in the literature and guide further research into the psychological burdens and treatment of patients with skin diseases.
      
      
        1.2 Psychotherapy for dermatological diseases
        In various studies with patients suffering from atopic eczema or psoriasis vulgaris, the beneficial effects of combined dermatological and psychosocial interventions on the improvement of the skin condition, reduction of scratching frequency, and psychosocial parameters have been demonstrated (23). Good results are also obtained in approaches like relaxation, breathing, and art therapy, or psychodynamic catathymic image perception (24). Cognitive therapies focus on the dysfunctional appraisal of stressful events (25). Most approaches, however, lack a focus on challenging emotions such as shame and self-disgust (23). Modern psychotherapy has increasingly embraced mindfulness techniques, derived from Buddhism, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based therapies (MBT). These approaches adapt mindfulness from Buddhism to promote acceptance of current situations, reduce mental distress, and enhance overall psychological wellbeing. Stress-related skin conditions can benefit from these mindfulness practices, as they help reduce the mental noise and foster wisdom, ultimately increasing tolerance to stress and improving skin health (26). Additionally, self-compassion, a key concept in compassion-focused therapy (CFT), involves viewing oneself kindly and empathetically during challenging times, recognizing the universality of suffering, and mindfully accepting it (27). Unlike shame, which entails self-devaluation and a harsh self-critical relationship, self-compassion nurtures a loving, understanding, and forgiving self-relationship (28). By promoting better self-regulation and motives to alleviate suffering, mindfulness and self-compassion interventions can effectively address pathological shame and self-disgust in the context of skin diseases. As such, the second objective of this study is to review existing literature on the scientific evidence for using compassion-based or mindfulness-based therapies to address self-disgust and shame in individuals with skin diseases.
      
    
    
      2 Materials and methods
      We chose a methodological approach based on the PRISMA statement (29) for study selection, systematic search and data synthesis. Ethics approval is not required for this type of research at our institution.
      
        2.1 Study selection
        Studies were selected using the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined prior to the literature search. Inclusion criterion 1 included studies investigating emotions of shame (or self-stigmatization or embarrassment) or self-disgust or experience of disgust in the context of (psycho-)dermatological diseases (psoriasis, acne, atopic eczema). Criterion 2 included studies investigating mindfulness-based or compassion-focused-therapy regarding the emotions shame or self-disgust in patients with dermatological diseases (psoriasis, acne, atopic eczema). We did not define any excluding design parameters and only included studies focusing on adult populations (≥ 18 year).
        Furthermore, we excluded pharmaceutical studies, quality assessments of clinical instruments or questionnaires, studies linking other types of emotions (e.g., nausea or anxiety) to skin diseases, and studies focusing on other types of dermatological diseases (e.g., sexually infectious diseases or skin picking). Additionally, as the effects of mindfulness interventions for improving quality of life (30) and experience of stigma in patients with skin diseases (18, 22) have recently been reviewed, studies with a primary focus on quality of life or stigmatization (without differentiating aspects of stigma) in the context of dermatological diseases were excluded. Studies examining mindfulness or self-compassion as traits or variables in therapy research were also excluded, a comprehensive review for the context of dermatological diseases was recently published (31). Studies examining compassion or mindfulness strategies outside of the context of dermatological diseases, or emotions of shame or disgust, were also excluded.
      
      
        2.2 Search strategy
        Based on our criteria, search terms were defined and combined logically to build a search operator. We used wildcards to include multiple concrete forms of the same word-stems: [(skin disease) OR (skin condition*) OR (disease risk) OR (dermatolog*) OR (acne) OR (eczema) OR (psoriasis)] AND {(shame) OR (disgust) OR (mindfulness) OR (compassion) OR (self-compassion) OR (bodily suffering) OR [(emotion*) AND (psycho*) AND (psychotherap*)] OR [(emotion*) AND (psycho*) AND (dermatolog*)]}. PubMed provides an option to add a NOT-operator. This was added for the following terms: NOT sexual abuse[Title/Abstract] NOT childhood[Title/Abstract] NOT dement*[Title/Abstract] NOT HIV/AIDS[Title/Abstract] NOT HIV[Title/Abstract] NOT breast cancer[Title]. The search results were combined using reference management software.
        The systematic search was conducted in January 2022 via the databases PubMed, Web of Science and PSYINDEX and yielded N = 6,505 studies (n = 2,097 Doublettes). One study [(32), retrieved via Google Scholar] was published later in 2022 and was subsequently added to the search results. One relevant study (32) was excluded by our search operator because it contained the word “childhood” in the abstract.
      
      
        2.3 Data synthesis
        The screening of the results was conducted between January and September 2022 (see Figure 2 for the PRISMA flow chart). A random selection of 496 studies was screened independently by all three reviewers based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined above. The remaining studies were split equally and randomly between the three reviewers and screened accordingly. The set of randomly selected studies was used to estimate the inter-rater reliability. Although all three reviewers agreed concerning a binary decision (in-/exclusion) for 96.6% of the studies, the inter-rater reliability of the study selection was weak (kfleiss = 0.359). Disagreements regarding the selection existed in the case of n = 17 studies and were discussed by all co-authors. Further inspection showed that two studies with relation to the quality of life also contained aspects of the emotion of embarrassment (33, 34) and were thus considered relevant. Furthermore, the inclusion and exclusion criteria related to social anxiety [included; (35, 36)], feelings of stigma [included; (35, 37, 38)], and skin picking [excluded; (39)] were interpreted differently by the reviewers. After discussing and resolving the disagreements, the agreement of study selection was 97.5% with substantial inter-rater reliability (kfleiss = 0.659). One study (40) was falsely excluded in the screening and included in the review process thanks to one reviewer’s comment. All studies for which reviewers were not able to resolve their disagreements were included in the next step of retrieving the full manuscripts.

        The full manuscripts of the remaining studies were subsequently retrieved. Studies were excluded if the full text was not available (n = 11), not written in English or German (n = 3), had a focus on skin disease or emotion that did not fit the inclusion criteria (n = 36), did not include an adult sample (n = 2), or investigated mindfulness and self-compassion as traits or not in relation to disgust or shame (n = 21). The main results across each group of studies were then summarized for a synthesis of the main outcomes.
      
      
        2.4 Risk of bias assessment
        The risk of bias was assessed independently using the NHLBI quality assessment tool (41). The tool consists of a catalog of questions that ask key questions about the internal validity of the respective study. There is a separate, suitable list of questions for each study type (controlled intervention studies, systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses, Observational Cohort, Case-Control Studies, etc.). Each point is queried with yes/no questions (unsuitable or non-answerable questions are answered with NA or “not reported”) and categorized as “good,” “fair” or “poor” (no quantification) according to predefined rules. Five independent reviewers rated the studies according to the applicable criteria. The detailed results of the risk of bias assessment can be found in the Supplementary Table 1. Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses often exhibited poor quality, raising concerns about the reliability of their findings. Controlled Intervention Studies, on the other hand, presented a heterogeneous picture ranging from poor to good quality, indicating the need for more standardized methodologies. Most studies fell within the category of Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. These studies demonstrated varying degrees of quality, generally falling within the fair to good range. Additionally, a selection of qualitative studies was also included in the analysis contributing to the diversity of the evidence base. Based on the COREQ-Assessment (42) they showed fair to good quality.
      
    
    
      3 Results
      
        3.1 Shame, embarrassment, and self-stigma in dermatological diseases
        Most of the literature that has examined shame, embarrassment, and self-stigma in dermatological conditions and that was included in the review comprised studies that examined patients with psoriasis. A total of 33 out of 46 included studies (72%) focussed exclusively or i.a., on psoriasis, while fewer studies focussing on acne (9 studies, 19%) or atopic eczema (4 studies 8.7%) were found.
        Several questionnaire studies show that people with skin diseases displayed high levels of shame (17, 43–46), albeit not general shame (47) [see review by (48)]; skin shame (48); social shame (49). In a cross-sectional study with 166 psoriasis patients, Jankowiak et al. (50) showed that higher levels of shame were especially found in cases with visible skin lesions [see review by (51)] and that older patients reported less shame.
        In addition, questionnaire studies found high levels of embarrassment (17, 33, 43, 45, 46, 52–55) associated with high self-consciousness about the skin disease (17, 56, 57), as well as high levels of self-stigma (17, 34, 58) in people with skin diseases. Again, visible lesions (e.g., scars) were associated with more embarrassment (59), and in psoriasis patients, this was even more acute than in people suffering from atopic eczema (60). Additionally, in a meta-analysis of ten qualitative studies of people with various dermatological conditions, emotional experience with embarrassment and shame emerged as one of the main themes (61). In one study, shame experience was also highlighted as the unifying factor between psoriasis and acne inversa patients in particular (62).
        Lahousen et al. (32) found that patients with psoriasis reported significantly higher levels of skin-related shame and disgust than healthy controls, as well as more negative appraisals of self-touching and parental touching. Interestingly, severity of skin condition was unrelated to shame and disgust. A qualitative study also found that people suffering from skin diseases had an impaired self-image and low self-esteem (17, 63, 64). In a study on sexual problems in psoriasis, the majority of men reported feeling embarrassed and less attractive due to skin lesions, and at least occasionally ashamed with sexual partners (65). Psoriasis patients often cited feelings of being stared at, and others’ erroneous beliefs that the disease was contagious, as stressors (65, 66). These feelings may cause avoidant behavior, thus perpetuating social exclusion and explaining the link between shame, stigmatization, and depression as well as lower quality of life (67).
        The study by Ginsburg and Link (37) showed that the fear of social exclusion harbored by psoriasis patients is not completely unjustified: 19% of patients experienced episodes of gross rejection as a result of their psoriasis. These experiences were accompanied by feelings of stigmatization. Magin et al. (68) also found embarrassment and low self-esteem as a result of teasing and bullying in people with dermatological conditions while Schielein et al. (69) showed that the main reason affected patients avoided sexual activity was shame and fear of rejection [see also (70)]. Since these feelings are fundamentally associated with social withdrawal and depression, Vladut and Kállay (71) call for multidisciplinary treatment in their review.
        In connection with psoriasis, Ginsburg and Link (38) worked out six dimensions of self-stigma via a questionnaire study: the anticipation of rejection, a feeling of being flawed, sensitivity to others’ attitudes, guilt and shame, secretiveness, and positive attitudes. The authors suggested that a high experience of stigma might be associated with increased non-compliance with treatment and thus symptom exacerbation.
        In a study by George et al. (72), what patients found helpful in dealing with the fear of social exclusion was active listening, shared decision-making, and communication of hope.
      
      
        3.2 Self-disgust and experience of disgust in dermatological diseases
        The state of research on disgust in dermatological diseases is considerably less comprehensive than that on shame and embarrassment. Mento et al. (73) also came to this conclusion in a literature review, according to which anger and disgust are neglected in studies. In a qualitative study, Wahl et al. (74) show that patients with psoriasis describe their bodies (especially in the case of visible skin rashes) as “offensive” and regard themselves as “unclean, infectious, disgusting, leprous, ugly, unattractive, strange, big, or different.” [see also (67)]. In an ethnographic qualitative study in different countries, dermatological patients described themselves with disgust and self-loathing (75).
        In a questionnaire study, over 60% of patients with psoriasis reported experiencing strong self-disgust (76), and the findings showed that sex, age, depression, and perceived stigmatization were predictors of self-disgust whereby the relationship between stigmatization and depression was mediated by self-disgust. Moreover, there is evidence that dermatological patients experience disgust in others differently from skin-healthy people. In an approach-avoidance task, patients with psoriasis and their significant others more strongly avoided faces displaying disgust, but not other emotions, compared to controls (40). In an fMRI study by Kleyn et al. (77), psoriasis patients showed a reduced ability to recall faces with disgust reactions compared to controls. The authors concluded that this related to learned coping mechanisms to protect themselves from the reaction of disgust in others.
      
      
        3.3 Psychotherapy for dermatological diseases: compassion-based-therapeutic approaches
        Although few studies to date have examined the effects of compassion-focused therapy on shame or disgust in skin conditions, empirical evidence supports the potential of CFT for reducing shame and enhancing treatment for patients with skin diseases. In a two-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) on 75 patients with facial acne who experienced skin-related distress and varying levels of depression, Kelly et al. (78) found that two compassion-focused interventions significantly reduced shame, as well as skin discomfort and depression, in comparison to a passive control. More mixed results were found in a four-week compassion focused self-help program (79). In this single-arm feasibility study with a small sample, two patients with initially high levels of shame and self-criticism reported significant reductions of shame and self-criticism at the end of the program, while two patients with relatively lower baseline levels experienced significantly increased levels of shame following the intervention (79). Thus, the limited evidence mostly supports the potential of CFT as an approach for individuals with skin diseases, particularly in reducing shame, self-criticism, and psychological distress.
      
      
        3.4 Psychotherapy for dermatological diseases: mindfulness-based therapeutic approaches
        For the effects of mindfulness-based approaches on shame and disgust in the context of skin disease, our search yielded only one study comparing MBT against CFT. In a feasibility RCT, Muftin et al. (80) tested a mindfulness self-help online program against a CFT program in 130 patients with psoriasis. Results showed that both four-week programs were acceptable and helpful in reducing shame and improving quality of life, suggesting that MBT may have comparable potential to CFT in alleviating shame and distress in patients with skin conditions.
      
    
    
      4 Discussion
      The primary goal of this systematic review was to search for evidence supporting that shame and self-disgust are psychological correlates of inflammatory skin diseases. The results provide strong evidence for shame, embarrassment, and self-stigma as significant aspects in dermatological conditions, particularly in individuals with psoriasis. In this line, patients often suffer from high emotional stress and social exclusion. Visible skin lesions increase the experience of shame, although older patients are often less affected. Shame and self-stigmatization do not necessarily correlate with the severity of the disease, but rather with the awareness of the skin problems and the social reactions to them. Patients report bullying, social exclusion, and misunderstandings about the degree of infection of the disease, which leads to social withdrawal and increased emotional distress. Sexual problems are also common and are associated with reduced self-esteem and shame. Results indicate that shame may contribute to symptom exacerbation via withdrawal and treatment non-compliance, though causal evidence is lacking.
      The evidence found on disgust as a concomitant of dermatological diseases is less extensive than on shame. The results indicate, however, that self-disgust is an emotional response associated with dermatologic diseases, particularly in relation to visible skin rashes.
      The second objective of the systematic review was to investigate the evidence for using compassion-based or mindfulness-based therapies to address self-disgust and shame in individuals with skin diseases. However, only three studies were found in total. The results on the effect of CFT-based therapy on shame and disgust in skin diseases are limited, but somewhat promising. At least there are already two RCT-studies that show that these interventions can reduce shame and skin discomfort in people with skin diseases.
      The results show that further exploration of self-disgust and perceived disgust in dermatology is needed to better understand its impact on the psychological wellbeing of patients and to develop effective interventions to address this aspect of the patient experience. The relation of shame and self-disgust with fear and experience of social rejection, and the link with treatment non-compliance, support the assumption of the bio-psycho-social model that negative self-directed emotions increase stress and, as a result, skin disease symptoms. Additionally, a mediating role of shame and disgust in the links between skin disease and depression or lower quality of life indicates that negative emotions increase patients’ psychological burdens and may be associated with less effective coping. Longitudinal studies are necessary to test the causal role of shame and disgust in disease progression. Further studies should also focus strongly on the initial promising effects of CFT and MBT on shame and disgust in skin conditions.
      While this systematic review provides valuable insights, several limitations should be considered. First, the overall quality of the included studies was moderate, with a particularly high risk of bias in many of the controlled intervention studies. Second, comparability across studies was limited due to substantial heterogeneity in both measurement instruments and the use of core constructs. As shown in Table 1, similar constructs such as “stigma,” “self-stigma,” and “self-disgust” were operationalized using more than 19 different instruments, reflecting inconsistent conceptualization across studies. Third, the number of intervention studies, especially randomized controlled trials, was low, which restricts the strength of conclusions regarding treatment effectiveness. Lastly, the wide publication span of the included studies (1982–2022) may have introduced cohort effects, potentially contributing to variability in findings.

      In conclusion, the findings of this review align with the adapted biopsychosocial model of skin disease progression. Patients with the three included inflammatory skin diseases are burdened by shame and self-disgust —central emotional responses to negative self-appraisal and social rejection—which are often related to experiences and fear of social rejection. These processes mirror the model’s pathways from skin conditions to negative self-related emotions, social difficulties, and increased arousal, though causal evidence is lacking. Mindfulness- and compassion-based approaches appear promising in addressing these shame and self-disgust and improving patient outcomes.

Title: Dysprosium, cerium, indium, yttrium, and lutetium as emerging contributors to oxidative stress in polycystic ovary syndrome

Abstract: To investigate the role of Dysprosium (Dy), Cerium (Ce), Indium (In), Yttrium (Y), and Lutetium (Lu) in relation to oxidative stress (OS) and their potential alterations in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) females. This case-control study included two groups: Healthy controls (50) and PCOS cases (56). Serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu were quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). OS was evaluated by measuring serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation was performed to investigate the correlation between rare earth elements (REEs) and OS markers and differences in correlation strength between the PCOS and control groups were assessed using Fisher’s z-test. PCOS subjects exhibited markedly higher concentrations of Dy, Ce, In, and Y than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The analysis of OS biomarkers revealed elevated MDA levels in the PCOS group, indicating enhanced lipid peroxidation, alongside significantly reduced antioxidant capacity (GSH and SOD) (P < 0.001). Pearson’s correlation demonstrated significant positive associations between higher Dy, Ce, and Y levels and increased MDA levels (P < 0.05). Additionally, a significant negative correlation was observed between In and Y and the antioxidant markers GSH and SOD (P < 0.05), with Ce also showing an inverse association with SOD (P < 0.05). Fisher’s z-test further confirmed significant differences in correlation strength between the PCOS and control groups for Dy-MDA (z = 2.01, P = 0.031), Ce-MDA (z = 1.78, P = 0.037), In-GSH (z = − 2.24, P = 0.025), and In-SOD (z = − 2.39, P = 0.017). Moreover, significant correlations were found between Dy and Y (r = 0.41, P = 0.003), Ce and In (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), Ce and Y (r = 0.53, P < 0.001), and In and Y (r = 0.70, P < 0.001), suggesting interconnected roles of Dy, Ce, In, and Y in PCOS. These findings point to a potential link between OS and REE exposure in the development of PCOS. They suggest that metal-induced oxidative damage could be a key contributor to its pathophysiology. The study underscores the need for deeper investigation into environmental factors affecting reproductive health and for identifying strategies to mitigate these risks in women with PCOS.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-10468-2.

Body: Introduction
      With the surge in technological and industrial progress, women’s health faces unprecedented challenges. The extensive use of metallic compounds in agriculture and domestic spheres has intensified exposure to various elements, raising significant concerns about their impact, especially on reproductive health. Rare earth elements (REEs), often known as ‘technology elements,’ are vital to the advancement of numerous high-tech fields, including consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones and computers) and sustainable energy technologies1–3. Although their distinctive chemical characteristics render them critical for such applications, growing environmental accumulation of REEs has raised concerns regarding their potential effects on human health, particularly in relation to reproductive disorders like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Environmentally, growing extraction, use, and disposal of these elements have led to their accumulation, with human activities contributing to their buildup in soil and water systems4–7. Human exposure to REEs is elevated due to their high mobility and ion-emitting properties, which allow them to easily enter ecosystems, accumulate in the food chain, and increase environmental exposure. As “emerging pollutants,” these elements remain largely unregulated, with limited monitoring and insufficient understanding of their toxic effects. Concerns about the health impacts of REEs are growing, particularly regarding their effects on reproductive health, including fertility and pregnancy outcomes8–11. Although studies on its reproductive toxicity are limited, evidence from animal models indicates that elevated doses may disrupt ovarian function and lead to embryotoxic effects. The adverse effects of REEs on reproductive function have been investigated in sea urchins, where exposure was shown to impair fertilization, disrupt redox balance, interfere with embryonic development, and alter the regulation of genes involved in embryogenesis12. Notably, some human studies have documented an increased risk of preeclampsia, neural tube defects, adverse IVF outcomes, spontaneous abortion, and premature membrane rupture with higher maternal REE levels13–16. More recently, an increased risk of pregnancy loss has been reported in women with miscarriage owing to increase in serum REE9–11. Metals like Dysprosium (Dy), Cerium (Ce), Indium (In), and yttrium (Y) and Lutetium (Lu), may pose a significant risk to reproductive health, due to their widespread use in modern technologies and potential toxicity1,17–19. A recent case–control study reported higher heavy metals in women with PCOS compared to controls, linking these alterations to metabolic dysfunction and environmental exposures19.
      PCOS is a complex endocrine disorder and a major cause of infertility in women globally17. The condition presents with irregular ovulation, excess androgens, and polycystic ovaries, though its underlying causes remain poorly understood20–22. While the etiology of PCOS is multifactorial, recent evidence suggests that environmental factors, including exposure to heavy metals and REEs, may contribute to its development23–25, however, underlying etiologies remain unclear. Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu are REEs that may have potential impacts on reproductive health. Presumably, they could induce oxidative stress (OS), and alter redox balance, potentially exacerbating conditions associated with PCOS13,26–28. Increased levels of these REEs can interfere with hormonal balance, affect ovarian function, and impair fertility. Oxidative damage resulting from REE exposure may alter reproductive processes like oocyte maturation and impair follicle development in the case of PCOS. While the full extent of their impact on human reproductive health remains under investigation, emerging research suggests that exposure to these REEs may contribute to reproductive toxicity and conditions such as infertility and PCOS. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to examine serum levels of selected rare earth elements - Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu in patients with PCOS. It seeks to explore the correlation between these elements and markers of OS, comparing PCOS patients with fertile controls. The reprotoxic effects of these five REEs are scarcely documented in pregnancy-related research involving humans, making them the subject of our study. By shedding light on these relationships, this research aims to provide new insights into how REEs may contribute to the development and progression of PCOS. The findings could have far-reaching implications for developing diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies, offering a deeper understanding of how environmental pollutants influence reproductive health and paving the way for targeted interventions. The study thus aims to estimate the serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu in women with PCOS and to assess the correlation between these REE levels and oxidative stress markers in PCOS patients compared to fertile controls.
    
    
      Result
      
        Participant characteristics
        This study revealed notable differences between women with PCOS and controls across clinical, and biochemical parameters. Among the participants, 52.8% were women with PCOS, while 47.1% served as controls. Sociodemographic characteristics showed no statistically significant variation across the study groups, as demonstrated by data from our prior study29. However, clinical features such as irregular menses (56%) and acne (60%) were significantly more prevalent among women with PCOS (P < 0.01).
      
      
        Biochemical profile and OS markers
        Biochemical assessments showed that fasting blood sugar (FBS) and HbA1c levels were markedly higher in the PCOS group than in controls (P < 0.001). Similarly, PCOS group exhibited significantly higher luteinizing hormone (LH) levels accompanied by increased triglyceride (TG) concentrations at P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 respectively (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). PCOS group exhibited a notable increase in MDA levels, a marker of lipid peroxidation, compared to controls (P < 0.001). Conversely, antioxidant markers such as GSH and SOD were significantly reduced in women with PCOS (P < 0.001).
      
      
         Rare Earth element levels
        REE levels differed significantly across the groups analyzed. Serum levels of Dy, was significantly higher in the PCOS group than in controls (P < 0.001), along with elevated levels of Ce, In, and Y, which were significant at P < 0.05. However, the levels of Lu remain insignificant between the two groups (Table 1).
      
      
        Correlation analysis between REEs and OS markers
        To assess the link between elevated REE levels and OS markers, Pearson’s correlation analysis was carried out (Table 2). In the control group, no significant associations were detected between REEs and OS markers. However, distinct patterns emerged in the PCOS group: (a) for MDA, positive correlations were observed with Dy (r = 0.29, p = 0.04), Ce (r = 0.30, P = 0.03), and Y (r = 0.33, P = 0.02) in PCOS subjects, while correlations in controls were weaker and nonsignificant. Fisher’s z-test indicated significant differences between groups for Dy (z = 2.01, P = 0.031), Ce (z = 1.78, P = 0.037), and Y (z = 1.90, P = 0.049) and (b) antioxidant Status: In and Y exhibited negative correlations with antioxidant markers-GSH and SOD (P < 0.05). GSH correlated negatively with In (r = − 0.30, P = 0.034), with a significant between-group difference (z = − 2.24, P = 0.025). SOD showed significant negative correlations with Ce (r = − 0.33, P = 0.02) and In (r = − 0.31, p = 0.02), with Fisher’s z-tests confirming significant between-group differences (z = − 1.90, P = 0.049; z = − 2.39, P = 0.017, respectively). These findings suggest altered associations between REEs and OS markers in PCOS compared to controls. In multiple testing correction, the raw P-values for markers (MDA, SOD, GSH, Dy) ranged from 0.000013 to 0.00042, indicating significant differences between PCOS cases and controls. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, markers with P-values < 0.00013 remained statistically significant. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction/False Discovery Rate (FDR) identified additional significant markers with P-values up to 0.045 (Supplementary Table 3). MDA and Dy remained significant after both Bonferroni and FDR corrections, showing strong associations. SOD and GSH were significant after FDR but only partially after Bonferroni correction. Lu was not significant by either method. Ce, In, and Y were significant only after FDR correction. This indicates that FDR correction might be better suited for detecting relevant findings in this exploratory study. The correlations that remain significant after multiple testing correction—especially after FDR adjustment can be considered statistically meaningful within the exploratory context of the study. Correlation plots for these relationships in PCOS cases are provided in Figs. 1, 2 and 3.

        Inter-Element relationships
        Table 3 displays the inter-element correlation analysis of REEs in the PCOS group. Y exhibited strong significant positive correlations with Ce (r = 0.53, P < 0.001), and In (r = 0.70, P < 0.001). Additionally, Y demonstrated a moderate positive correlation with Dy (r = 0.41, P = 0.003). Further, a strong positive correlation was observed between In and Ce (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), suggesting a notable relationship between these elements. Lu showed no significant correlations with other elements in the study, indicating weaker relationships in comparison to other pairs. In summary, significant positive correlations were primarily observed between Yttrium (Y), Indium (In), and Cerium (Ce), while the other element combinations showed weak or no significant relationships.

      Discussion
      The findings of this study uncover a critical link between REEs and PCOS, highlighting their potential role in disrupting redox balance and contributing to OS. Women with PCOS exhibited significantly elevated serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, and Y compared to healthy controls, alongside reduced antioxidant defenses and a shift toward oxidative dominance. These results emphasize the impact of environmental exposure to REEs on reproductive health and suggest OS-induced metal toxicity as a key factor in the pathophysiology of PCOS.
      This study provides a new perspective on the environmental and biochemical influences underlying PCOS. REEs, commonly used in various industrial applications have garnered attention for their potential health impacts. However, the toxicity and biological effects of REEs on human reproductive health have been poorly studied, particularly in conditions such as PCOS. This study suggests that environmental exposure to REEs may exacerbate OS, contributing to the reproductive challenges observed in PCOS. Among the REE-Lutetium (Lu), dysprosium (Dy), cerium (Ce), indium (In), and yttrium (Y) play essential roles in modern technologies. Lutetium is primarily used in high-performance catalysts for petroleum refining and nuclear medicine for cancer treatment30. Dysprosium is crucial in the production of high-performance permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and electronics, and also finds applications in lasers and nuclear reactors31. Cerium, being the most abundant REE, is used in catalytic converters for automobiles to reduce emissions, in glass polishing, and the manufacturing of batteries and fuel cells32. Indium, typically extracted from zinc ores, is widely used in the production of thin-film photovoltaic cells, LCDs, and semiconductors, as well as in solders and alloys33. Yttrium, though relatively abundant among REEs, is essential in producing phosphors for displays, superconductors, lasers, and cancer treatments. These elements are extracted from minerals like bastnasite and monazite and have become critical components in technologies such as electronics, renewable energy systems, and environmental applications34. The growing use of REEs has resulted in their accumulation in soil and water, raising concerns about environmental and health risks, particularly regarding their effects on reproduction and pregnancy35,36. High doses of In have been shown to impair ovarian function and exhibit embryotoxic effects in animal studies37. Yttrium has also been reported to accumulate in reproductive tissues, which may interfere with normal reproductive processes; however, its human health impact remains uncertain38. Elevated serum REE levels have also been linked to adverse reproductive outcomes, including poor in vitro fertilization success, spontaneous abortion, and premature membrane rupture39. These effects highlight the distinct cytotoxic profiles of individual REEs across species and underscore the variability in their toxicological impacts.
      This study expands on previous research by examining REEs in women with PCOS and their potential links to OS. Notably, serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, and Y were significantly elevated in the PCOS cases relative to controls at P < 0.05. These elevated REE levels were positively associated with increased lipid peroxidation, as indicated by higher MDA levels (P < 0.05), and negatively correlated with reduced antioxidant markers, including SOD and GSH (P < 0.05). The findings of the current study are consistent with previous studies22,40,41. Significant positive correlations between REEs (Dy, Ce, Y) and MDA, along with negative correlations with antioxidants (GSH, SOD), were observed only in PCOS patients. These associations differed significantly from controls, indicating that REEs may specifically contribute to OS in PCOS. This highlights a potential role of REE exposure in the disease’s oxidative pathophysiology. The significant correlations between REEs in the PCOS group: Dy and Y (r = 0.41, P = 0.003), Ce and In (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), Ce and Y (r = 0.53, P = 0.0006), and In and Y (r = 0.70, P = 0.0001, further suggests interconnected roles of Dy, Ce, In, and Y in PCOS. Our findings demonstrate significant alterations in OS markers in PCOS cases compared to controls. The use of multiple testing corrections ensured that the reported associations are unlikely to be false positives. The Bonferroni correction, while conservative, confirmed the strongest associations (MDA, Dy), whereas the Benjamini-Hochberg method allowed for the detection of additional markers (Ce, In, Y) that may be biologically relevant. Overall, correcting for multiple testing ensured the reliability of the findings, with both conservative and liberal approaches highlighting key differences in oxidative and elemental profiles of PCOS patients versus controls.
      Despite decades of research, the precise pathogenesis of PCOS remains elusive. While its underlying causes are still being investigated, emerging evidence highlights OS as a critical factor in its development. The augmented OS in PCOS can be traced back to several sources. This study postulates that exposure to REEs such as Dy, Ce, In, and Y may contribute to the onset or progression of PCOS through OS-mediated mechanisms. REEs are known to induce OS by disrupting the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant defense systems42. Elevated OS has been documented in the follicular fluid and serum of women with PCOS, highlighting their significant contribution to the pathophysiology of the condition23. Among these biomarkers, malondialdehyde (MDA), a stable end-product of lipid peroxidation has proven to be a reliable indicator of oxidative damage. Studies have reported a 47% increase in circulating MDA levels in women with PCOS compared to controls, underscoring the role of lipid peroxidation in the metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions characteristic of the disorder43,44.
      Cells defend against free radical damage using antioxidant systems, including enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. Of prime importance, Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a key enzyme that neutralizes ROS by converting superoxide anions (O₂⁻) into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). There is conflicting evidence regarding SOD levels in PCOS, with some studies reporting elevated levels, while others have found decreased activity in serum and follicular fluid45,46. Increased SOD activity protects against OS-induced damage, while decreased activity can lead to apoptosis and corpus luteum regression41. These interactions emphasize the importance of SOD in ovarian function and reproductive health. Imbalances between antioxidants and ROS in follicular fluid can impair oocyte quality, potentially causing abnormal ovulation and infertility, as observed in PCOS patients42. Another key molecule in defending against OS is Glutathione (GSH), a major non-enzymatic antioxidant crucial for neutralizing oxidants and maintaining cellular redox balance. In PCOS, GSH depletion is likely due to elevated oxidants47,48. Presumably, heavy metals exacerbate this depletion by binding to GSH’s sulfhydryl (-SH) groups, forming organo-metallic complexes that disrupt their antioxidant function and further impair cellular defense mechanisms49,50. The OS in PCOS cases observed in the current study aligns with previous evidences. REE exposure in sea urchins led to a marked increase in OS, along with impaired fertilization outcomes and increased developmental defects in offspring as reviewed by Martino et al..,202212. Likewise, studies on algae, including common cyanobacteria, have revealed that Yttrium exposure impairs the antioxidant defense system, leading to increased OS51. More recently, elevated levels of similar elements and impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms in PCOS patients have also been reported18,19,50. Together, these studies highlight the role of REEs in amplifying OS, potentially influencing reproductive health outcomes like those observed in PCOS.
      As reported in previous studies, elevated OS significantly compromises oocyte quality by inducing lipid peroxidation, which impairs maturation and increases the prevalence of immature oocyte25. Moreover, OS disrupts granulosa cell function, which is critical for follicular growth and steroid hormone production, resulting in anovulation, a hallmark of infertility in PCOS43. These disruptions not only impair follicle maturation but also alter the endometrial environment, further intensifying reproductive challenges in women with PCOS. In summary, REEs may worsen PCOS by triggering OS, disturbing endocrine function, and hindering follicle development, all of which contribute to the onset or exacerbation of the condition. To better understand the mechanistic role of REEs in PCOS pathophysiology, future studies should focus on both in vitro and in vivo models. Cellular experiments using ovarian granulosa cells or theca cells could investigate how exposure to elevated REEs affects oxidative stress pathways, mitochondrial function, and steroidogenesis, key processes altered in PCOS. Assessing changes in ROS generation, antioxidant enzyme activity, and expression of genes regulating inflammation and hormone synthesis would clarify direct cellular effects. Animal models of PCOS could be used to evaluate systemic impacts of REE exposure on reproductive and metabolic phenotypes, including hormonal profiles, follicular development, and insulin resistance. Additionally, exploring potential REE-induced epigenetic modifications might uncover long-term regulatory changes contributing to PCOS progression. Human studies incorporating longitudinal designs could assess whether environmental or dietary REE exposure correlates with PCOS onset or severity. Integrating multi-omics approaches, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, may reveal downstream molecular networks perturbed by REEs. Together, these approaches would provide comprehensive insight into how REEs influence PCOS development and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
    
    
      Conclusion
      This study highlights the potential role of REE-induced oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of PCOS. The observed trends point to the need for greater awareness of environmental pollutants in reproductive health. These preliminary findings open new avenues for exploring environmental contributors to PCOS and underscore oxidative stress as a potential therapeutic target.
      
        Limitations of the study:
        While this study is among the first to assess associations between REEs and oxidative stress in PCOS, it did not account for environmental or lifestyle confounders (e.g., diet, pollution, occupational or cosmetic exposure) that may influence REE levels and oxidative stress. The Bonferroni correction, while conservative, confirmed the strongest associations (MDA, Dy), whereas the FDR method allowed the detection of additional markers (Ce, In, Y) that may be biologically relevant but require validation. Future studies should explore the clinical implications of these markers and validate the borderline findings.
      
    
    
      Method
      
        Study design and participants
        This case-controlled study involved women aged 19 to 35 years, divided into two groups: Group I, comprising 50 healthy controls, and Group II, consisting of 56 women diagnosed with PCOS. The study recruited participants from the Section of Obstetrics and Gynecology at King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, located in Riyadh. Ethical clearance was granted by the hospital’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), under approval number E-18-3536. All procedures followed the ethical standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to participation, each individual provided written informed consent.
      
      
        Inclusion and exclusion criteria
        
          PCOS Group:
          Women who met at least two of the following criteria were included in the PCOS group: (a) hyperandrogenism, (b) polycystic ovarian morphology, or (c) experiencing oligo- or amenorrhea, characterized by less than 8 menstrual cycles within a 12-month period. These cases were screened based on the Rotterdam criteria52.
        
        
          Control group:
          Healthy females without any symptoms of hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, infertility, or ultrasound findings suggestive of PCOS.
        
        
          Exclusion criteria:
          Patients on lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications, pregnant women, and those with diabetes, anemia, cancer, infections, thromboembolism, stroke, or ischemic heart disease were excluded.
        
      
      
        Sample collection and baseline characteristics
        Approximately 5 mL of blood was collected from each participant after obtaining written informed consent. The blood was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm to isolate the serum, which was then stored at −80 °C until further analysis to preserve its integrity. Baseline characteristics were assessed using an autoanalyzer, with the Mediserv 3700/Cell Dyne (STA Compact) and Roche Elecsys 2010 (Modular Analytics E170-Cobas e 411) for relevant tests.
      
      
        Detection of oxidative stress
        
          Lipid peroxidation (Malondialdehyde- MDA assay):
          MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were quantified using the MDA Assay Kit (ab118970; Abcam). A standard curve was created with MDA concentrations ranging from 4 to 20 nmol/well or 20–100 µM. The assay measures the formation of MDA-TBA adducts at 532 nm, with a sensitivity of > 0.1 nmol/well. MDA levels were reported in nmol/ml.
        
        
          Antioxidant markers (GSH and SOD):
          Glutathione (GSH) levels and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity were assessed using the Glutathione Assay Kit (CS0260; Sigma) and the SOD Assay Kit- Water-Soluble Tetrazolium salt; WST (19160; Sigma), respectively. In the GSH assay, the formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB), resulting from the reduction of 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), is monitored by measuring its absorbance at 412 nm, with GSH levels expressed in mg/ml. For SOD activity, absorbance at 450 nm was measured after incubating the samples with Water-Soluble Tetrazolium salt (WST) and enzyme working solutions at 37 °C for 20 min. SOD activity was reported in IU/ml.
        
      
      
        Quantification of REE
        Once thawed, serum samples were centrifuged to remove cells, resulting in clear serum. A volume of one milliliter of sera was diluted with a solution of 0.5% nitric acid and 0.01% Triton X-100 to ensure the elements remained dissolved and stable. Subsequently, levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu were measured using the Perkin Elmer NexION 2000G ICP-MS. Certified reference materials (CRMs) with a concentration of 1000 ppm were employed for calibration, and serum metal levels were quantified in parts per billion (ppb). A calibration curve was established with working standards covering 0.025 to 100 ppb. Each standard concentration was measured three times, and a multi-point linear regression was used to correlate signal intensity with concentration. To enhance measurement accuracy and reduce matrix effects, a constant amount of germanium (Ge) was added as an internal standard to all serum samples. The resulting calibration curve exhibited excellent linearity, with a coefficient of determination (R²) exceeding 0.999. LOD values for each element were calculated by assessing the distinction between blank sample signals and background interference, with detection limits as low as 0.025 ppb, reflecting the high sensitivity of the ICP-MS instrument. The method demonstrated strong reliability, with measurement accuracy ranging from 0.3 to 22.8% and precision between 0.8% and 11.8%.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Data analysis was conducted using Sigma Plot version 12. About 56 PCOS cases and 50 healthy controls were initially recruited; statistical analyses were conducted on 50 participants in each group. Six PCOS samples were excluded due to poor sample quality or missing data, resulting in a final sample size of 100 (50 per group) for all comparisons and correlation analyses. The exact number of data points used in each analysis was consistent. The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed the normality of paired differences, allowing the use of paired t-tests for comparison of measured variables. Pearson’s correlation was performed to examine associations between REEs and OS markers. Differences between correlation coefficients in the PCOS and control groups were assessed using Fisher’s z-transformation followed by a two-tailed z-test. To account for the issue of multiple hypothesis testing, P-values were adjusted using both the Bonferroni correction and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (FDR). For Bonferroni correction, the significance threshold was set at P < 0.003. For the FDR, adjusted P-values were evaluated at a significant level of 0.05. Scatter plots were used to visualize correlations between REEs, MDA, GSH, and SOD.

Title: The PCOS Phenotypes in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study: participant clinical features and data harmonization on analysis of individual participant data

Abstract: BackgroundPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifaceted condition with diagnostic challenges and clinical heterogeneity across populations. Research priorities include enhanced accuracy in defining cut-offs for diagnostic features. Here, we aim to describe participant clinical features and data harmonization in the international PCOS Phenotype in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study.MethodsWe searched EMBASE and Medline (Ovid) from 1990 to October 2, 2020, in population-based, medically unbiased study cohorts. Included studies had ≥ 300 participants, directly assessed PCOS-related features, and provided Individual Participant Data (IPD). Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS tool. Data integrity was ensured via cross-referencing, identifying outliers/implausible data, and variable harmonization. Reporting follows PRISMA-IPD guidelines, summarizing findings with frequencies and proportions.ResultsThe study included 9979 reproductive-age women from 12 studies across eight countries (China, Iran, Italy, Nigeria, Russia, South Korea, Turkey, and the USA), representing 11 ethnicities. Ovulatory dysfunction was variably recorded, from mean menstrual cycle length, minimum or maximum cycle length, number of cycles per year, or urinary progesterone measurements. Clinical hyperandrogenism was assessed via modified Ferriman–Gallwey (mFG) scores, with a few also including acne and alopecia. Biochemical hyperandrogenism thresholds varied (95th, 97.5th, or 98th percentile of healthy controls). Polycystic ovary morphology was assessed via transvaginal, transabdominal, or transrectal approaches. Harmonization adhered to International PCOS Guidelines for ovulatory dysfunction, ethnicity-specific cut-offs for hirsutism (via k-means clustering), and 95th percentile thresholds for biochemical hyperandrogenism. PCOS prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 19.8% in the original studies and was 11.0% overall after harmonization.ConclusionsThe P-PUP study offers an unprecedented, ethnically diverse, medically unbiased population-based cohort, an extraordinarily valuable tool to enhance knowledge and research in PCOS. However, variability in data collection methods and definitions of PCOS diagnostic features across studies limited the ability to fully integrate data for analysis. Despite these limitations, we optimized harmonization in this IPD, and the findings provided valuable insights into the challenges of data harmonization and established a foundation for future collaborative research. Future research should focus on standardizing data collection, establishing normative cut-offs based on true natural groupings, and linking diagnostic clusters to outcomes in diverse populations.Protocol registrationCRD42021267847.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12916-025-04221-9.

Body: Background
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrinopathy with significant long-term reproductive, metabolic, dermatological, and psychological health impacts [1]. According to the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines criteria, diagnosis in adults is based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: (1) oligo-/anovulation (OA); (2) clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA); and (3) either polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound or elevated serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels [2–5]. In adolescents, the diagnosis requires both OA and HA [2–5]. It is estimated that 10–13% of women worldwide are affected by PCOS, and the global incidence is reportedly increasing, making PCOS a major public health concern [2–6]. PCOS and its associated health implications generate substantive health [7, 8] and economic burdens for individuals, societies, and governments [9–12].

      Despite increasing research and publications on PCOS [13], the pathogenesis remains unclear and there are significant persisting challenges in diagnosis. This is attributable to its multifaceted and heterogeneous clinical presentation, the lack of gold-standard diagnostic tests, ethnic variation, and the fact that most studies are carried out in medically biased (clinically based) populations [14–19]. It is also due to the multiple components of the diagnostic criteria, which are all continuous variables [20–22], the paucity of data on normative cut-off thresholds for each diagnostic component within unselected, diverse populations [23, 24], and the use of arbitrary diagnostic cut-offs across studies [25–31]. This contributes to delayed or inaccurate diagnosis of PCOS, hindering timely and appropriate interventions to limit complications and treat the condition [12, 32–35].
      These challenges underscore the importance of consolidating data from diverse populations for a more comprehensive understanding of the condition [16]. While traditional systematic reviews and meta-analyses represent an improvement over single-center studies, they are limited by aggregated data from original studies with varying methodologies, sample sizes, and study populations. Conversely, the PCOS Phenotype in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study, is a large-scale, international individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis designed to address identified challenges, allowing harmonization of raw data from individual studies, standardization of cut-offs and analyses across studies and examination of individual-level variables to advance knowledge on PCOS etiology, diagnosis and clinical features in unselected community-based populations [36].
      This report on the P-PUP study aims to (a) outline the selection criteria and study identification process for the study, (b) describe the clinical features of the populations included, and (c) detail the data harmonization process for PCOS diagnostic criteria and features within the study.
    
    
      Methods
      
        Protocol and registration
        The protocol for the P-PUP study was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021267847) and published previously [36]. This study was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of Individual Participant Data guideline [37].
      
      
        Selection of studies
        The methodology for the selection and identification of research groups and collaborators has been described previously [36]. In summary, a systematic search of the EMBASE and Medline (Ovid) databases, along with a manual Google search, was conducted from 1990 to October 2, 2020, to identify eligible unselected population-based cohort studies. Key search terms included PCOS, ovulatory dysfunction (OD), hirsutism, polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM), and unselected populations, among others. A full search strategy for Medline (Ovid) is in Additional file 1: Table S1. The PCOS research community (RA and HJT) was consulted to identify any potentially ongoing or unpublished studies.
        Cross-sectional or longitudinal cohort studies were considered eligible if they were published after 1990 (after a change in diagnostic criteria), included a sample size of 300 or more unselected women of any age, ethnicity, or weight, and directly assessed features related to PCOS [36]. These features of PCOS included measurement of ovulatory dysfunction, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. No language restrictions were imposed. Studies that relied on self-reported or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for PCOS status without the assessment of PCOS features were excluded. Exclusion criteria at the participant level included pregnant and lactating women, women with natural/surgical menopause, ovarian pathology, and women meeting the criteria for exclusion of other conditions in the diagnosis of PCOS. Additionally, women receiving contraceptive hormonal treatment within 3 months of assessment were excluded from the androgen analysis.
        Titles and abstracts were initially screened by a single reviewer (SK), and then full-text articles were retrieved and assessed in duplicate (SK and ADB) with any discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer (HJT). The corresponding and/or lead authors of the identified studies were contacted and requested to contribute to deidentified IPD for integration and analysis. For authors who did not respond, two reminder emails were sent.
      
      
        Data collection processes
        Data and relevant dictionaries were transferred to the ISO 27001-certified Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) [38] which restricts access and control to the authorized data custodian and researchers. The key variables collected aligned with the PCOS core outcomes set [39] and included sociodemographic factors (age and race/ethnicity); generic outcomes (weight, height, body mass index (BMI)), metabolic outcomes (waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profiles, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose (FBG)); dermatological (hirsutism as measured by modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG score) and reproductive outcomes (androgen assays, menstrual cycle length, number of menstrual cycles per year, age of menarche, and PCOM features including antral follicle count (AFC) and ovarian volume (OV)). Any data discrepancies or concerns were discussed and resolved with the original study investigators.
      
      
        Risk of bias assessment
        We evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies providing IPD using the AXIS appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies [40]. The appraisal was conducted by two independent reviewers (ADB and RRD), and any discrepancies were resolved through consensus. This tool consists of 20 items that assess various aspects such as the study’s aim, design, sample size, outcome variable measurement, statistical methods, response rate, result consistency, discussion and conclusion, limitations, and ethical approval, with responses categorized as “yes,” “no,” or “don’t know” [41]. Overall quality was rated as low (score 1-7), medium (score 8-14), or high (score 15-20) [41].
      
      
        Data harmonization and analysis
        Data synthesis involved rigorous procedures to ensure data integrity and harmonization across diverse datasets. All laboratory measurements were standardized to the International System of Units (SI) for consistency. Outliers were identified using scatter plots and box plots, applying a criterion where values exceeding > 5 or > 10 standard deviations were flagged [42]. Invalid or implausible data points, such as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) surpassing systolic blood pressure (SBP), and height < 120 cm were identified, based on consensus clinical judgment and predefined criteria. Definitions of outliers, invalid data points, and rules for variable harmonization were documented and collaboratively discussed with original study investigators to achieve consensus on data handling (Additional File 1: Table S4).
        For the harmonized definition of PCOS, we adhered to the International PCOS Guideline criteria, requiring two of three key features: OD, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. The specific criteria for each feature were defined as follows:◦ OD: Menstrual cycles numbering fewer than eight or exceeding 17 per year, and/or cycle lengths shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days.◦ Clinical hyperandrogenism: Defined by hirsutism quantified through the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) scoring system. We analyzed ethnic distribution patterns of mFG scores using descriptive statistics of means and medians. Subsequently, we standardized the data (mean = 0, SD = 1) and performed a k-means cluster analysis (k = 2), with cluster determination guided by the average silhouette method, following our previously published methodology [43].◦ Biochemical hyperandrogenism: Defined using study-specific 95th percentile cut-offs for first-line androgen tests (TT, FT, cFT, and FAI), supplemented by secondary markers (A4 and DHEAS) when first-line tests yielded negative results. This approach accounts for variations in assay methods and reference ranges across studies.◦ Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM): Given the considerable heterogeneity in imaging modalities, ultrasound approaches, and absence of individual participant data (IPD), harmonization of PCOM data proved unfeasible; thus, we relied on each study's original definitions and categorizations for this criterion.
        This study undertook a one-stage approach for analysis and only included women of reproductive age between 18 and 45 years. Continuous variables were reported as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), as appropriate for the distribution of data. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and proportions. Available case analysis was employed, and we did not opt to undertake multiple imputations for any missing data because they could not be random. Stata 18 software was used for data management and analysis.

        Study characteristics and risk of bias
        The literature search identified 6507 publications, from which 1437 duplicates were removed. After screening the titles and abstracts, 342 studies underwent full-text review of which 313 studies were excluded (Additional File 1: Table S2). Finally, 29 studies met the eligibility criteria and their authors were contacted. Of these, the authors of 19 studies, encompassing 31,580 participants, did not respond. Of the 10 authors who responded, seven expressed willingness to collaborate and completed the data-sharing process, whereas three studies involving a combined total of 17,439 participants were unable to do so [44–46]. Additionally, two ongoing studies were identified through other researchers, and two authors contributed more than one study from different populations. The entire P-PUP study dataset encompassed 12 population-based medically unbiased representative cohorts [26, 31, 47–56] and 12,513 participants drawn from PCOS research groups spanning eight countries internationally (Fig. 1). A detailed assessment of the included studies’ methodological quality appraisal is presented in Additional File 1: Table S3. All of the included studies had a low risk of bias (high quality) [26, 31, 47–56].Fig. 1PRISMA IPD flow diagram for P-PUP study selection
        Table 1 presents the characteristics of the final included studies. The entire P-PUP study dataset included studies from China (n = 2; 4645 women) [48, 52], Iran (n = 3; 2517 women) [49, 53, 54], Italy (n = 1; 519 women) [50], Russia (n = 1; 2695 women), South Korea (n = 1; 499 women) [26], Turkey (n = 1; 392 women) [51], the USA (n = 2; 806 women) [55, 56], and Nigeria (n = 1; 440 women) [47]. All studies were cross-sectional in design with sample sizes ranging from 392 to 3000.

        Participant selection after data harmonization
        Of the total 12,513 participants in the P-PUP study, 2046 were excluded due to missing data on age (n = 6), age < 18 years (n = 609), age > 45 (n = 1178), natural/surgical menopause (n = 81), current pregnancy/lactation (n = 40), and ovarian pathology (n = 48). Additionally, 488 participants were excluded due to abnormal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH > 25 IU/L), prolactin (> 67.2 µg/L), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP > 30 nmol/L), or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH > 5 µU/mL) (Fig. 2, Additional File 1: Table S4). A total number of 9979 participants was included in the final analysis following data harmonization. The predominant ethnicities represented in reproductive-age women were 40.1% Asian Han Chinese, 23.8% White Iranians, and 9.5% White Russians (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Flow chart for study participant selection. Note: TSH, prolactin, and 17-OHP were not consistently collected across the total populations in the studies, as some studies collect the data on women suspected of having PCOSFig. 3Ethnicity distribution of the study participants
      
      
        Assessment of ovulatory dysfunction
        All studies collected information on ovulatory dysfunction (OD) through the assessment of menstrual cycles, but the data collection methods were heterogeneous. Four studies collected data about OD in categorical form [48, 52, 55, 56], with differing cut-offs: fewer than 21 days, 21–35 days, or greater than 35 days [52]; 35 days or less or greater than 35 days [56]; less than 26 days and greater than 35 days [55]; and another reported it as a binary with regular (21–35 days) or irregular (fewer than 21 days, greater than 35 days or irregular bleeding) [48]. Six studies collected actual menstrual cycle length [26, 31, 47, 49, 53, 54], seven studies collected the number of menstrual cycles per year [31, 47, 49–51, 53, 54], and one study recorded the minimum and maximum menstrual cycle lengths, in addition to the overall menstrual cycle length [31]. One study also reported minimum and maximum cycle lengths and cycle numbers per year in addition to the categorical menstrual cycle status, with nearly 60% missing data [48]. Except for one study [31] which had 4% (62/1550) missing data, the remaining studies provided complete data on OD (Additional file 1: Table S5).
        The definitions of OD varied across studies and are summarized in Table 1. Most studies defined OD based on menstrual cycle length or the number of menstrual cycles per year, with some including progesterone levels to further assess ovulation status. OD was most commonly defined by using an upper limit of menstrual cycle length greater than 35 days [31, 47–49, 52–56], with another study using a threshold of greater than 34 days [51]. The lower limit for menstrual cycle length also varied, with three studies using less than 21 days [31, 48, 49, 53], one study using less than 24 days [51], one using less than 26 days [55], and another one using less than 25 days [47]. For the number of menstrual cycles per year, four studies defined OD as less than eight menstrual cycles per year [26, 31, 47, 52], while two studies used the cut-off of fewer than nine cycles per year [55, 56]. Additionally, three studies incorporated a lack of menses for three consecutive months as part of their OD definition [26, 49–51, 54, 55]. Mid-luteal progesterone level was utilized by three studies as part of their assessment of OD [51, 54, 55]. The reported prevalence of OD in the included studies ranged from 9.2 to 31.9%, with an overall aggregated prevalence of 18.2%. For data harmonization, we defined OD as fewer than eight or more than 17 menstrual cycles per year and/or a menstrual cycle length of less than 21 days or greater than 35 days, in alignment with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines [2–5]. Based on this definition, the prevalence of OD across the included studies ranged from 3.7 to 31.9%, with an overall prevalence of 15.3% (Table 2).

        Assessment of clinical hyperandrogenism
        All included studies assessed clinical hyperandrogenism, using hirsutism as a primary criterion [26, 31, 47–56]. Hirsutism was assessed directly by a health professional, including gynecologists, midwives, physicians, nurses, endocrinologists, and general practitioners using the mFG score. Hirsutism was defined by an mFG score of 6 or higher in six studies [26, 47, 48, 51, 55, 56], 8 or higher in five studies [49, 50, 52–54], and 5 or higher in one study [31].
        All studies reported acne [26, 31, 47–56], with nine providing IPD [26, 47, 49, 50, 52–56], and three incorporating acne into their definition of clinical hyperandrogenism [48, 52, 54]. One study employed the Burke-Cunliffe acne grading method, assessed by a physician [50]; six studies employed the standard acne lesion assessment of the face, back, and chest, assessed by gynecologists, midwives, physicians, and general practitioners [31, 47, 49, 52–54]; two studies mentioned that no specific acne scoring system was used, with assessments conducted by nurses [55, 56], while another two studies did not provide details on the acne scoring tools used, with assessments conducted by physicians [48, 51]. One study used self-reported acne without a specific scoring system [26]. Among studies that included acne in their clinical hyperandrogenism definition, a score of two or higher was used in one study [52], six or higher in another [54], and the cut-off was not specified in one study [48].
        Six studies reported on the presence of female pattern hair loss (FPHL) [31, 47, 50, 52, 54, 55], with four providing IPD [47, 50, 54, 55], and two incorporated FPHL into their definition of clinical hyperandrogenism [50, 54]. The presence of FPHL was assessed by gynecologists, physicians, nurses, and general practitioners using the Ludwig scale in three studies [31, 50, 52], while three other studies provided no details on the FPHL assessment tool used [47, 54, 55]. FPHL was reported in a categorized form in two studies with no cut-offs provided [50, 54].
        For data harmonization, we defined clinical hyperandrogenism using hirsutism only in alignment with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines which highlights hirsutism as the strongest predictor of hyperandrogenism. We used ethnicity-specific mFG score cut-offs derived from k-means (k = 2) cluster analysis in our recent publication [43]. The thresholds were set at mFG score ≥ 8 for Iranians, ≥ 7 for White Italians and Black Africans, ≥ 5 for Asian Han Chinese, White Russians, Turkish, and Black Americans, and ≥ 4 for White Americans, Asian Koreans, Asian Russians, and Mixed Russians [43]. Based on these cut-offs, the prevalence of clinical hyperandrogenism ranged from 8.1 to 34.2% in individual included studies, with an overall aggregate prevalence of 14.2% (Table 3).

        Assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism
        Biochemical hyperandrogenism was assessed in all included studies except for one study done in Nigeria [47]. Seven studies assessed all participants [31, 48–51, 53, 56], three studies [26, 54, 55] assessed selective subgroups, and the remaining one study collected blood samples from a random half of the population [52]. Among the studies that assessed androgen levels in selective subgroups, Tehrani et al. assessed only participants with either hirsutism (mFG score ≥ 8) or menstrual disorder (26% of the sample, 260/1000) [54]; Azziz et al. assessed only participants with menstrual dysfunction (48.7% of the sample, 189/388) [55]; and Kim et al. assessed participants who consented to provide blood samples (32.1% of the sample, 160/499) [26].
        Of the included studies, 11 reported total testosterone (TT) [26, 31, 48–54, 56], seven reported calculated free androgen index (FAI) [26, 31, 49, 51–54], eight reported androstenedione (A4) [49–56], and nine reported dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) [26, 31, 49–51, 53–56]. The assay method used included enzyme immunoassay (EIA) [49, 53, 54], liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) [31, 50], chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) [31, 51, 52], radioimmunoassay (RIA) after extraction [55, 56], and RIA [26, 48, 51, 55, 56] (Table 1). Three studies reported free testosterone (FT) [48, 55, 56]: two reported calculated FT (cFT), derived from TT measured by an in-house RIA after serum extraction and SHBG binding activity by equilibrium dialysis using Sephadex G-25 and [3H]T as the ligand, and approximations for binding to albumin [55, 56], while one study reported directly measured FT utilizing RIA [48].
        Biochemical hyperandrogenism was defined using the selected control subgroups as above 95th percentile in eight studies [26, 49, 51–56], above 97.5th percentile in one study [50], above 97.7th percentile (equivalent to 2 standard deviations above the mean in normally distributed data) in another study [48], and above 98th percentile in one study [31] (Table 1). The prevalence of biochemical hyperandrogenism varied widely across studies, ranging from 5.6 to 30.0%, with an overall prevalence of 17.4%. In this study, we adapted the 95th percentile cut-off specific to each study for harmonization to account for variations in assay methods and reference ranges across studies. We used first-line tests (TT, FT, cFT, and FAI) and second-line tests (A4 and DHEAS) when first-line tests were negative, as per the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines. This approach revealed a biochemical hyperandrogenism prevalence ranging from 11.0 to 30.3%, with an overall prevalence of 20.4%. The overall prevalence remained nearly the same at 20.2% when studies assessing selective subgroups of populations were excluded (Table 4).

The reported laboratory values were converted to the SI unit using the following conversion factors: for A4 3.49 from ng/mL to nmol/L and 0.00349 from pg/mL to nmol/L; for TT 3.47 from ng/mL to nmol/L and 0.0347 from ng/dL to nmol/L; for FT 0.003467 from pg/mL to nmol/L and 0.03467 from ng/dL to nmol/L; for DHEAS 0.00271 ng/mL to µmol/L and 0.0271 µg/dL to µmol/L. For data harmonization, we utilized the 95th percentile cut-off specific to each individual study population, applying first-line tests (TT, FT, and FAI) and incorporating A4 and DHEAS when first-line tests were negative, in accordance with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines
      
      
        Assessment of polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM)
        Eight included studies assessed all participants for PCOM. One study provided PCOM as a binary variable [49], OV data was provided by six studies [26, 31, 47, 48, 51, 52], while AFC was provided by seven studies [26, 31, 47, 48, 51–53]. The imaging modalities used included transvaginal ultrasound with a band frequency ranging from 5 to 13 MHz, and transabdominal ultrasound with a band frequency ranging from 1 to 9 MHz. Additionally, transrectal ultrasound was utilized in two studies [26, 52]. Unfortunately, the IPD in the included studies did not specify the ultrasound approach, either transvaginal, transabdominal, or transrectal.
        Except for Makwe et al. which defined PCOM as having an AFC count of ≥ 20 and/or OV ≥ 10cm3 [47], all other included studies used older criteria, defining PCOM as having an AFC count of ≥ 12 and/or OV ≥ 10cm3 [26, 31, 48, 49, 51–53]. The reported prevalence of PCOM varied widely across studies, ranging from 6.6 to 39.9%, with an overall prevalence of 19.2% (Table 5). Due to the heterogeneity in imaging modalities, ultrasound approaches, and lack of IPD, data harmonization for PCOM was not feasible, and thus we relied on each study’s original definitions and categorization.

        Prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
        Of the included study, eight defined PCOS using the Rotterdam criteria [26, 31, 47–49, 51–53], while the remaining four used the National Institutes of Health (NIH 1990) criteria and did not include ultrasound data for PCOM [50, 54–56]. The reported prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 19.8%, with an overall prevalence of 11.7% using each study’s original definition. For data harmonization, we defined PCOS by applying the International PCOS Guidelines criteria, requiring two out of three key features: OD, hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. We defined OD as fewer than eight or more than 17 menstrual cycles per year and/or a menstrual cycle length of less than 21 days or greater than 35 days; we defined hyperandrogenism as either clinical (limited to ethnicity-specific hirsutism scores) or biochemical (using study-specific 95th percentile cut-offs for first-line androgen tests, supplemented by secondary markers when first-line tests were negative), in accordance with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines recommendations. Post harmonization, the prevalence of PCOS ranged from 3.3 to 18.3%, with an overall prevalence of 11.0% (Table 6).

      Discussion
      The P-PUP study represents the first international IPD-based meta-analysis involving unselected (medically unbiased) women from the general population, assessed for PCOS features, offering a unique and diverse cohort to explore PCOS characteristics across heterogeneous populations. This comprehensive dataset includes a large sample size of 9979 women aged 18–45 years from 11 primary ethnicities, eight countries and four continents. Our analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in data collection methods and the definitions used for PCOS diagnostic features, particularly in the assessment of ovulatory dysfunction. This variability contributed to a wide range of reported prevalence of PCOS across original studies, from 3.3 to 19.8% (11.7% overall). After data harmonization, the PCOS prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 18.3%, with an overall prevalence of 11.0%.
      Ovulatory dysfunction (OD) is a key component in the International Guidelines PCOS diagnostic criteria, focused on menstrual cyclicity, and irregular cycle length and number per year. The International PCOS Guidelines [2–6], defined irregular cycles as > 90 days for any one cycle in women 1-year post menarche, < 21 or > 45 days in women one to less than 3 years post menarche, < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year in women 3 years post-menarche to perimenopause, while acknowledging the need for further research [57]. We identified significant variations in menstrual cycle data collection, especially prior to the International PCOS Guidelines. Categorical and continuous data was collected, including average cycle length in days, average cycle number per year, minimum and maximum cycle length and cycle number per year. OD cut-offs were variable across studies. Here, we harmonized OD data aligned with Guideline recommendations, reporting a prevalence of 3.7% to 31.9% or 15.5% overall. Future studies should collect standardized continuous data on cycle length (in days) and cycle number per year, with clear explanations of cycle length as the number of days from the first day of one period to the first day of the next, to limit confusion with the duration of menstrual bleeding. While acknowledging the inherent variability of cycles in PCOS and limitations of self-reported data for large-scale epidemiology studies, standardized data collection and definitions would substantially minimize error while ensuring consistency and comparability across studies. The International PCOS Guideline’s OD cut-offs were derived from the 95th percentile of menstrual cycle duration, based on variable control populations which likely included women with PCOS [58]. Using this percentile as a diagnostic cut-off, particularly when it is not linked with clinical outcomes, including anthropometric outcomes (weight, waist-hip circumference, BMI), reproductive outcomes (androgens, ovulation frequency, pregnancy complications), and cardiometabolic (insulin resistance, lipid profiles, blood pressure, fasting glucose), represents a crude and overly simplistic approach [58]. Moving forward, applying advanced analytics including cluster analysis to define cut-offs based on well-defined unselected populations and clinical correlates such as association with other PCOS features or with long-term outcomes is a research priority captured in the International PCOS Research Road Map [59].
      Hyperandrogenism is an essential PCOS diagnostic feature and manifests clinically as hirsutism, acne and androgenic alopecia. Acne and androgenic alopecia are relatively nonspecific markers of hyperandrogenism, particularly in PCOS [2–5, 16]. While validated scoring systems exist for acne and androgenic alopecia, these are not universally agreed upon for PCOS due to limited research in PCOS populations, ethnic variations, and clinical contexts. In included original studies, acne and alopecia were inconsistently reported, with variable tools and definitions. In contrast, hirsutism is strongly correlated with biochemical hyperandrogenism and is the most reliable clinical sign of hyperandrogenism in PCOS [60, 61]. The modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) visual scale is Guideline recommended [62] and was used in all included original studies. Historically, a cut-off mFG score of ≥ 8 defined hirsutism in PCOS, based on a misinterpretation of original Ferriman and Gallwey data at the 95th percentile of a predominantly white population [63, 64]. In P-PUP IPD we established ethnicity-specific mFG cut-offs via k-means cluster analysis, with cut-offs ranging between 4–6 for the majority of populations [43]. This aligns with the International PCOS Guidelines recommendations for an mFG score of 4–6 to diagnose hirsutism [2–5]. Clinical hyperandrogenism ranged from 6.8 to 28.4% (13.7% overall) in original studies with variable mFG cut-offs and use of acne and alopecia. With cluster analysis cut-offs and data harmonization, we report a prevalence of 8.1% to 34.2% (14.2% overall) and aligned to Guidelines, cluster-defined mFG cut-offs are recommended.
      Biochemical hyperandrogenism in PCOS focuses on elevated free testosterone, which may be measured directly or calculated primarily through FAI and cFT. Our recent systematic review and meta-analysis informed the International PCOS Guidelines recommendation to use TT and FT as a first-line laboratory test for biochemical hyperandrogenism [65] using LC–MS/MS methods with the best accuracy [66, 67]. In the P-PUP study, only two original studies used LC–MS/MS [31, 50], all others relied on less specific and sensitive immunoassay. Cut-offs for biochemical hyperandrogenism varied, with arbitrary thresholds at the 95th, 97.5th, or 98th percentile of healthy controls. In P-PUP we adapted the 95th percentile cut-off for androgens specific to each study to harmonize data reporting a prevalence from 11.0 to 30.3% in original studies, with an overall prevalence of 20.4%. Further cluster analyses are underway to refine definitions and address persisting limitations.
      PCOM is evaluated using pelvic ultrasonography and is characterized by either ovarian enlargement, measured as increased OV, and/or an excess of small antral follicles, either within the entire ovary (FNPO) or a single cross-sectional image (FNPS) [68]. Cut-offs for OV and FNPO vary by ultrasound technology and approach. The 2023 International PCOS Guidelines recommend the transvaginal ultrasound approach, FNPO ≥ 20 in at least one ovary or OV ≥ 10 ml to define PCOM in adults. If older ultrasound technology is used, the AFC count is ≥ 12 in at least one ovary. PCOM is not recommended in adolescents as it lacks specificity [2–5]. In the present analysis, only one study adhered to these recommendations and transabdominal and transrectal ultrasound approaches were also used, with no validated PCOM cut-offs, limiting harmonization and resulting in the retention of original study definitions. Guidelines now clearly recommend a transvaginal ultrasound, and cut-offs for FNPO and OV which need to be applied, along with the inclusion of AMH measurements.
      
        Strengths and limitations
        This study has several strengths. Firstly, this IPD is unique and includes a large diverse, international IPD set, with generalizability to those with PCOS. Unselected participants also minimize selection bias, as seen in clinic-based cohorts. Also, the IPD analysis allowed standardization of definitions and cut-offs across studies and aligned with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines to minimize heterogeneity and enhance comparability. Limitations include heterogeneity in data collection methods, particularly for ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. Some original data could not be harmonized, affecting the comparability of results across populations. Most original studies relied on immunoassays for androgen measurement, which are less accurate than LC-MS/MS. Most studies also used older ultrasound technology and variable approaches and lacked sufficient methodological detail, with reliance on original study PCOM definitions. Although serum AMH is now recommended as an alternative marker for PCOM, this data was not available. Lastly, although the study included participants from four continents and eight countries, including participants from diverse ethnic backgrounds enhanced generalizability, notable geographic and cultural gaps in representation persist, underscoring the need for more globally comprehensive PCOS research.
      
    
    
      Conclusions
      The P-PUP study brings together an unprecedented cohort of ethnically diverse, unselected population-level data to enable research and advance knowledge in PCOS. In integrating this IPD we have shown a lack of standardized data collection methods across original studies. Cut-offs for PCOS diagnostic features also vary, jeopardizing diagnostic accuracy and consistency and impacting data harmonization. This work directly addresses the high research priorities identified in the PCOS Guidelines research roadmap, which emphasizes creating international data repositories and standardizing research approaches [59]. Future research efforts should prioritize the standardization of data collection methods that align with the International PCOS Guidelines and PCOS core outcome sets [39], while simultaneously refining definitions and establishing accurate normative cut-offs for individual PCOS diagnostic features. These diagnostic thresholds should be based on cluster analysis and natural groupings, identifying diagnostic clusters that are linked to short and long-term outcomes in medically unbiased, unselected, and diverse populations. This dual approach to standardization would facilitate big data integration and the development of machine learning–driven models for precision medicine in PCOS.

Title: Dupilumab treatment for prurigo nodularis: a retrospective study of 76 patients

Abstract: IntroductionPrurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic pruritic and inflammatory skin disorder and dupilumab is currently the only biologic agent approved in China for the treatment.AimTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in managing moderate to severe PN through a retrospective study of 76 patients.Material and methodsA retrospective analysis was conducted of clinical and laboratory data from PN patients who received regular dupilumab treatment for 52 weeks at the Dermatology Department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between March 2021 and June 2023. Assessments were made at baseline (week 0), and at weeks 4, 8, 16, 26, and 52 using prurigo nodule counts, Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) scores, Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores to evaluate clinical symptoms and pruritus. Adverse events occurring post-treatment were also recorded to assess the drug’s safety and efficacy.ResultsA total of 76 patients with moderate to severe PN were included in this study. By week 52, there were significant reductions in prurigo nodule counts, IGA scores, NRS scores, and DLQI scores. Prurigo nodule counts decreased from a baseline of 74.64 ±33.45 to 2.3 ±0.9, IGA scores from 3.53 ±0.54 to 0.54 ±0.33, NRS scores from 7.65 ±2.27 to 1.01 ±0.65, and DLQI scores from 18.46 ±4.53 to 1.55 ±0.68, with all differences being statistically significant (p < 0.05). Seven patients experienced injection site reactions, and 2 patients developed facial erythema, which resolved either spontaneously or with symptomatic treatment. No other adverse events were reported.ConclusionsDupilumab effectively reduces the number of PN, improves IGA scores, alleviates pruritus, and enhances quality of life in patients with moderate to severe PN, with a high safety profile.

Body: Introduction
      Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic pruritic and inflammatory skin disorder characterized by symmetrically distributed, often on the extremities and occasionally on the trunk, keratotic papules and nodules accompanied by intense and unbearable itching [1]. The aetiology of PN remains unclear; however, it can be triggered by various factors including skin diseases, systemic conditions, and neuropsychological factors, with their interactions exacerbating the skin lesions [2]. Type 2 inflammatory responses are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease [3].
      The treatment options for PN are diverse, and there is no consensus on the standard treatment regimen. Therapeutic approaches include both systemic and non-systemic treatments [4]. Non-systemic therapies, considered first-line, encompass topical corticosteroids (TCS), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI), and intralesional corticosteroid injections. However, the prolonged use of TCS may lead to adverse effects such as skin atrophy, telangiectasia, acne, and folliculitis [5]. Systemic treatments include gabapentinoids, antidepressants, immunosuppressants, and biological agents such as dupilumab and nemolizumab [6]. Methotrexate [7] and thalidomide [8] have also been reported to effectively alleviate inflammation and pruritus, but their long-term use is limited by adverse effects. Dupilumab received FDA approval for PN in September 2022 and has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing pruritus and skin lesions with rare associated side effects [9]. A phase 3 clinical trial suggested that nemolizumab had good efficacy in the treatment of PN [10], and it was approved by the FDA for the treatment of PN in August 2024. However, nemolizumab has yet to obtain the approval for marketing in China.
      Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the alpha subunit of the IL-4/13 receptor. By blocking the biological activities of IL-4 and IL-13, dupilumab inhibits type 2 inflammatory responses [11]. Since IL-4 and IL-13 are implicated in the pruritic mechanisms associated with PN, dupilumab may offer therapeutic benefits for this condition. Dupilumab has been approved in China for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in patients aged 6 years and older.
    
    
      Aim
      This study retrospectively evaluates the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in managing moderate to severe PN, and the results are summarized as follows.
    
    
      Material and methods
      
        Study population
        A total of 76 patients diagnosed with moderate to severe PN and treated with dupilumab at the Dermatology Outpatient Clinic of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from March 2021 to June 2023 were included in the study. Diagnostic criteria: (1) presence of refractory nodular skin lesions; (2) pruritus duration of ≥ 6 weeks; and (3) history and/or signs of repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing. Inclusion criteria: (1) meeting the above diagnostic criteria and confirmed PN diagnosis; (2) disease severity assessed as moderate to severe by the same primary dermatologist, with Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) ≥ 3 and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) ≥ 4; (3) age ≥ 18 years at the time of initial treatment; (4) history of inadequate response to traditional PN treatments; and (5) signed informed consent for dupilumab treatment and good compliance, with all patients completing the 52-week treatment. Exclusion criteria: (1) pregnant and lactating patients; (2) patients with active systemic infections such as parasitic infections, hepatitis, tuberculosis, syphilis, or HIV; (3) patients with progressive malignant tumours; (4) patients with other severe underlying diseases that could interfere with efficacy evaluation; (5) differential diagnoses such as nodular pemphigoid, skin tumours, or scabies; and (6) patients who had received systemic phototherapy, other biological agents, immunosuppressants, or small molecule drugs within 6 months before or during the treatment period.
      
      
        Treatment protocol
        Patients enrolled in the study received subcutaneous injections of dupilumab administered by trained professionals. The initial dose was 600 mg, given as two subcutaneous injections. Thereafter, 300 mg was injected every 2 weeks. After 16 weeks of treatment, the maintenance dose was adjusted based on the patient’s condition by the clinician, either continuing with 300 mg every 2 weeks or extending to 300 mg every 3–4 weeks, administered regularly. Dupilumab injection solution (Dupilumab), brand name: Dupixent®, manufactured by Sanofi, was provided in pre-filled syringes at a dosage of 300 mg (2.0 ml) per syringe, with two syringes per box.
        During the course of dupilumab treatment, patients were allowed to concurrently use oral antihistamines, topical moisturizers, TCS, and TCI.
      
      
        Study methods
        The retrospective study collected general patient information from outpatient medical records. During and after the dupilumab treatment period, follow-up phone interviews were conducted by dedicated personnel. Data on the number of nodules, IGA, NRS, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores were recorded at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 16, 26, and 52 of treatment [12]. Adverse events post-treatment were also documented.
        
          General information
          Basic information included patient name, age, gender, and visit date. Medical history data encompassed age at initial onset, duration of the disease, diagnosis and treatment history, atopic history, past medical history, and drug allergy history.
        
        
          Efficacy evaluation criteria
          IGA Score: Severity was graded based on the number of prurigo nodules: Grade 0 (no lesions, 0 nodules), Grade 1 (almost clear, 1–5 nodules), Grade 2 (mild, 6–19 nodules), Grade 3 (moderate, 20–100 nodules), and Grade 4 (severe, more than 100 nodules).
          NRS Score: Patients self-rated the intensity of the most severe itch experienced in the past 24 h on a scale of 0 to 10. A score of 0 indicated no itching, 1–3 indicated mild itching (not affecting sleep), 4–6 indicated moderate itching, 7–9 indicated severe itching (disturbing sleep), and 10 represented the worst imaginable itching.
          DLQI Score: The DLQI was used to assess the impact of the skin disease on the patient’s quality of life over the past week. It included 10 items covering symptoms such as itching, soreness, pain, stinging, embarrassment, impact on shopping and housework, choice of clothing, social and leisure activities, sports, work or study, relationships, sexual activity, and the burden of treatment. Each item was scored from 0 to 3, with a total score range of 0–30. Higher scores indicated a greater impact on quality of life: 0–1 (no effect), 2–5 (mild effect), 6–10 (moderate effect), 11–20 (large effect), and 21–30 (extremely large effect).
        
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 29.0 software. Categorical data were expressed as percentages (%). The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the normality of continuous data. Normally distributed data were analysed using paired t-tests, while non-normally distributed data were analysed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Data were described as mean ± standard deviation (SD), with a significance level set at p < 0.05.

      Efficacy analysis
      All patients completed the 52-week treatment. Dupilumab has shown significant clinical efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe PN. During the initial 16 weeks, patients received a regular dosage of 300 mg every 2 weeks. After completing the 16-week treatment, patients with severe conditions continued with bi-weekly injections, while those with marked improvement extended the injection interval to every 3–4 weeks. There were significant reductions in the number of nodules, IGA scores, NRS scores, and DLQI scores at weeks 4, 8, 16, 26, and 52 of treatment (Table 2). These differences were statistically significant (Figure 1).

      This study meticulously documented the safety of dupilumab in treating moderate to severe PN. The primary adverse reactions observed during treatment included injection site reactions and facial erythema (Table 3). These reactions were mild in severity; injection site reactions resolved spontaneously and did not impact subsequent treatments after changing the injection site. Facial erythema was transient and improved with symptomatic treatment. Throughout the 52-week treatment period, no patients experienced serious adverse events requiring discontinuation of therapy.

      Discussion
      PN is often associated with severe pruritus and is resistant to conventional treatments. The intense itching compels patients to self-mutilate through scratching, resulting in disfigurement, depression, and significant impairment of quality of life. Patients with PN experience considerable deterioration in quality of life, with the vast majority (97.2%) trapped in an itch-scratch cycle, leading to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depressive states due to the severe and unrelenting pruritus. Multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that PN is associated with Th2 inflammatory immune responses [13, 14]. Various inflammatory cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of PN, with increased expression of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-31 detectable in prurigo lesions [3, 15]. It is also related to neurogenic inflammation triggered by repeated scratching of the lesions. Studies have shown strong expression of p75NTR in the lesional skin of PN, indicating specific neuropathic involvement in PN. Additionally, cortistatin (CST) and substance P (SP) have been detected in the epidermis. The SP/MRGPRs pathway plays a significant role in the immune response and pruritus associated with PN [16]. There is also evidence suggesting that immune processes involving Th1, Th17, and Th22 pathways play a role in its development [2, 17]. Current evidence indicates that the JAK-STAT pathway is also involved in the pathogenesis of PN [18].
      Traditional systemic therapies for PN such as thalidomide, glucocorticoids, and immunosuppressants like cyclosporine have shown limited clinical efficacy and significant potential toxic effects. These treatments may also impose a greater health burden on elderly patients with comorbid conditions [19–22]. With the emergence of new increased expression of mRNAs for IL-4, IL-17, IL-22 and IL-31 in skin lesions of subacute and chronic forms of prurigo therapeutic targets in recent years, novel therapies have gradually been developed. These include biologics such as dupilumab, nemolizumab, tralokinumab, and lebrikizumab, as well as various small molecule agents like neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, Janus kinase inhibitors, and µ-opioid receptor antagonists/m-antagonists/k-agonists. These therapies have shown promising efficacy [23, 24]. However, except dupilumab and nemolizumab, the sample sizes for these treatments remain relatively small, and they have not yet been approved for the treatment of PN.
      Since its approval for atopic dermatitis (AD), dupilumab has been widely utilized, demonstrating clear efficacy and safety [14, 25]. PN shares certain clinical and pathophysiological features with AD, which is considered one of the most relevant disease factors for PN. This shared pathophysiology likely underlies the effectiveness of dupilumab in treating PN [3, 26, 27]. Dupilumab functions by inhibiting IL-4 signalling through binding to type I and type II receptors and IL-13 signalling through binding to type II receptors, thus blocking Th2 cell-mediated inflammatory responses. This mechanism disrupts the distinctive itch-scratch cycle in PN, leading to clinical remission [28]. Therefore, we selected dupilumab for the treatment of moderate to severe PN and aimed to evaluate its efficacy and safety in this patient population.
      We present real-world data from a 52-week follow-up study of 76 patients with PN who were treated with dupilumab at the Suzhou Hospital, China. The data indicate that dupilumab significantly improved both the clinical signs and manifestations of PN. The average age of onset for PN in our cohort was 50 years, with no significant gender differences noted, and the majority of patients had comorbid conditions.
      Our findings demonstrate a reduction in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores from a baseline of 7.65 to 6.24 at the 4-week follow-up and further to 0.54 at the 52-week follow-up. DLQI scores decreased from a baseline of 18.46 to 13.35 at the 4-week follow-up and to 1.55 at the 52-week follow-up. These results confirm the substantial efficacy of dupilumab in improving both pruritus and quality of life for PN patients.
      The NRS and DLQI scores showed more pronounced improvements in the early follow-up periods (4 weeks and 8 weeks), with subsequent, albeit less dramatic, improvements observed at the 52-week follow-up. This indicates that dupilumab has a notable impact on alleviating pruritus and enhancing quality of life in the initial treatment phase. Conversely, the IGA scores and nodule counts did not exhibit significant reduction during the first 16 weeks but demonstrated more pronounced improvement in later follow-up periods (16 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks). This suggests that dupilumab is more effective in reducing disease severity and nodule count with prolonged treatment. Thus, dupilumab is not only effective in the early stages of treatment but also maintains its therapeutic efficacy over the long term.
      Beck et al. [29] reported in 2018 on 3 cases in the United States, demonstrating that within 12 weeks of treatment with dupilumab, there was a notable reduction in pruritus symptoms, a decrease in the overall size and number of prurigo lesions, and a marked improvement in quality of life. In a retrospective study conducted in Italy by Chiricozzi et al. [30] in 2020, significant improvement in skin lesions was first observed at 4 weeks, with further amelioration in pruritus and PN lesions evident by 36 weeks. Clinical improvement was assessed via the IGA, and both pruritus and insomnia, as measured by the NRS, showed substantial reductions.
      A long-term retrospective study by Georgakopoulos et al. [31] in Canada in 2021 found that 78.9% of patients reported a subjective improvement in pruritus by 16 weeks, with 41.17% of patients demonstrating clinical symptom improvement by 52 weeks. In a 2023 real-world observational study conducted in China, Fang and Lian [32] observed that pruritus symptoms in PN patients exhibited rapid relief within 2 weeks of initiating treatment, with significant improvement in skin lesions noted at both 4 and 8 weeks. Additionally, Cao et al. [25] in a 2023 systematic review concluded that dupilumab treatment led to a significant reduction in NRS scores at weeks 4, 12, 16 and beyond 16 weeks, with at least 87.5% of PN patients achieving clinical remission. These findings are congruent with our prior clinical trial results.
      Conversely, Cunha et al. [33] reported in 2022 from Portugal that a patient exhibited a decrease in NRS scores and a reduction in nodule count only after 3 months of dupilumab treatment. This suggests that adult patients with severe, treatment-resistant chronic PN, may require an extended period to achieve therapeutic response when treated with dupilumab.
      Comparing the data from dupilumab treatment for atopic dermatitis [34–36] with for PN patients, it appears that dupilumab may require a longer duration of treatment to achieve its full therapeutic effects in PN. Unlike AD patients, those with PN experience a slower reduction in pruritus and a more gradual resolution of skin lesions.
      In a comparison of our findings with a phase III open-label extension study by Blauvelt et al. [37], it is evident that the reduction in IGA scores was significantly greater in AD patients (1.5 points) compared to PN patients (0.19 points) at the 4-week mark. In terms of VAS scores, AD patients exhibited a more substantial decrease in pruritus, reaching 5.0, whereas PN patients had a lesser initial reduction of 1.41 points. Additionally, DLQI scores indicated that AD patients experienced a more significant improvement in quality of life (4.9 points) during the early treatment phase compared to PN patients (5.11 points).
      However, in the later stages of treatment (16 weeks to 52 weeks), PN patients showed a more pronounced decrease in VAS scores, indicating more substantial relief from pruritus. Furthermore, the DLQI scores for PN patients decreased significantly in the later stages, reflecting a notable improvement in quality of life, while the improvement in AD patients was relatively gradual.
      These differences in response times may be attributable to the distinct pathological characteristics and therapeutic response mechanisms of the diseases. AD patients may exhibit a more rapid initial response to dupilumab, but as treatment progresses, the rate of improvement may plateau. In contrast, PN patients may have a slower initial response, but with continued treatment, the therapeutic effects become more evident, demonstrating more significant long-term improvements, particularly in pruritus relief and quality of life enhancement.
      In this research, adverse effects were generally mild and self-limiting, resolving either spontaneously or with symptomatic treatment. Notably, no cases of conjunctivitis – a commonly reported adverse reaction – were observed, and no patients discontinued therapy due to adverse effects, underscoring the favourable tolerability profile of dupilumab. Further investigation is warranted to characterize the nature of injection site reactions and determine their relationship with drug dosage or administration frequency. Additionally, the occurrence of facial erythema might be attributed to either local drug effects or individual skin sensitivity, necessitating further exploration of its underlying mechanisms.
      In this research, limitations are conspicuous. We adopted the method of open design with no control and a pre-post self-comparison protocol was implemented. The enrolled patients had a history of poor response to conventional PN treatments. Since we hypothesized that the probability of clinical improvement without dupilumab was relatively low based on existing evidence and clinical experience, this self-comparison approach was selected. PN is a chronic, stubborn skin disease with patients suffering from severe itching and few treatment options. For patients open to biological agents, a placebo control might lead to early treatment dropout due to lack of expected results, causing ethical and practical issues. The study was in an outpatient setting. Patient communication about condition changes made a single-blind condition unfeasible. So, an open-label retrospective study was done. Despite its limitations like inability to confirm causal links as in a randomized trial and weaker evidence, it allows data collection for future in-depth studies, and provides valuable insights for future research under better conditions.
      We allowed patients to use antihistamines and TCS, which might lead to potential biases in the final outcomes. Given that dupilumab takes time to exert its effects and there is no contraindication for concomitant medications, we did not compel patients to discontinue the use of antihistamines and TCS with less-than-ideal efficacy until the skin rashes and itching were truly alleviated.
      While the infrequent and mild nature of adverse events supports the overall safety of dupilumab, the study’s limitations include a relatively small sample size and the potential overlap between atopic dermatitis and PN. Such overlap could impact treatment efficacy as patients with AD might exhibit a more pronounced initial response to dupilumab, potentially skewing the observed rates of clinical symptom relief. Future research should address these limitations by incorporating larger sample sizes and accounting for the effects of disease overlap on treatment outcomes.
      The rates of observed clinical symptom relief may be affected by baseline patient traits, including disease duration, severity, and comorbid conditions. Thorough analyses of such baseline factors are crucial for pinpointing variables that notably influence treatment effectiveness. Moreover, patient compliance is crucial for assessing the long-term consequences of dupilumab treatment as it facilitates understanding the sustained efficacy of the drug in treating PN and ensures persistent adherence to the prescribed treatment protocol. These further analyses will provide a more comprehensive assessment of dupilumab’s efficacy, safety, and clinical relevance in the management of PN, thereby offering more robust evidence for its use in clinical practice.
    
    
      Conclusions
      Our data indicate that dupilumab is a highly effective and safe treatment option for PN. Dupilumab has shown significant benefits in reducing the number of prurigo nodules, improving IGA scores, alleviating pruritus, and enhancing the DLQI scores in patients with moderate to severe PN, while maintaining a favourable safety profile.
      Compared to atopic dermatitis, patients with PN may require a longer duration of treatment with dupilumab to achieve comparable therapeutic effects. Although the emergence of various small-molecule drugs has expanded the treatment options for PN, these alternatives often present with greater limitations or side effects.
      Currently, dupilumab stands out as a leading option for the treatment of PN due to its efficacy and safety. Future research should focus on conducting rigorous randomized controlled trials to further validate these findings. Such studies will facilitate the optimization of treatment regimens and the development of personalized therapeutic strategies tailored to individual patient profiles, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life for PN patients.

Title: Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Association with Ulcerative Proctitis: Surgical Management in a Refractory Case to Topical and Systemic Treatment

Abstract: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), a challenging dermatological condition, can be described as a chronic, painful, follicular, occlusive disease that is characterized by painful nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts generally located in the intertriginous skin areas. This disorder places a considerable burden on affected individuals and often leads to significant impairment in quality of life for those grappling with its persistent and recurrent nature. We present the case of a 20-year-old male patient known to have ulcerative proctitis and diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2020, for which he underwent various topical and systemic treatments, with periods of remission and recurrent flares without managing to obtain complete remission of HS. In our dermatology service, the patient underwent two surgical unroofing procedures combined with punch debridement, with the wounds being allowed to heal by secondary intention. This choice of treatment delivered great results with favorable outcomes, without recurrence of the lesions, proving to be an effective method for managing HS. By presenting this case, we underline the role of surgical procedures in managing HS, and our desire is to emphasize the importance of comprehensive understanding of this enigmatic and complex condition for more effective management strategies in patients with refractory disease.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Hidradenitis suppurativa, also known as acne inversa [1], stands as a dermatological enigma characterized by the chronic and debilitating nature of its inflammatory skin lesions. HS is a chronic follicular occlusive disease affecting the follicular portion of the folliculopilosebaceous units (FPSUs), characterized by the development of painful nodules, abscesses, and sinus tracts, that places a considerable burden on affected individuals [2]. This disorder primarily affects the intertriginous areas, such as the axillae, groin, and buttocks, and often leads to significant impairment in quality of life for those grappling with its persistent and recurrent nature [3].
      The epidemiology of HS is a dynamic landscape, with estimates suggesting a prevalence of approximately 1% in the general population [4]. However, this prevalence might be underestimated due to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis, underscoring the need for heightened clinical awareness. HS typically emerges in early adulthood, presenting a peak onset in the second and third decades of life. The gender predilection is notable, with a higher prevalence in females, although the disease’s severity may be more pronounced in males [5].
      The pathogenesis of HS involves a multifaceted interplay of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors. Current evidence suggests a polygenic inheritance, with mutations in genes associated with inflammation, innate immunity, and the follicular epithelium contributing to disease susceptibility. Dysregulation of the immune response, particularly involving the interleukin pathway, plays a pivotal role in the inflammatory cascades observed in HS [6].
      The probable instigating factor for the initial formation of HS lesions is follicular occlusion, which stems from the proliferation of ductal keratinocytes, resulting in follicular hyperkeratosis and blockage. It is suggested that associated factors within this process are the hormones and nicotine, which have a negative impact on the follicular epithelium. The resulting anoxia within the follicular duct, induced by follicular epithelial hyperplasia, contributes to the disturbance of the usual terminal differentiation of follicular keratinocytes, obstructing the follicular passage and subsequent follicular rupture [7]. 
      The occlusion of hair follicles, subsequent inflammation, and bacterial colonization contribute to the formation of abscesses and sinus tracts characteristic of HS lesions. Skin tunnels that have been firmly established ultimately emerge onto the surface of the skin, undergoing persistent inflammation. Lifestyle factors such as smoking, obesity, and poor diet further exacerbate the disease, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive understanding of the disease’s pathophysiology [8]. Furthermore, several studies indicate a correlation between HS and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [9], both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) [10], as they exhibit some similarities to HS regarding clinical manifestations, genetic predisposition, and immunological characteristics.
      Regarding its clinical manifestation, hidradenitis suppurativa unfolds with painful, inflamed nodules that may progress to abscesses and sinus tracts. These lesions predominantly manifest in intertriginous areas, including the axillae (most common site), inguinal area, inframammary, and perianal regions. The formation of skin tunnels, clusters of exposed comedones (referred to as tombstone comedones), and scarring are outcomes observed in cases of recurring or persistent disease. The disease course is generally marked by recurrent flares and remission periods, which contribute to its chronic nature [11]. 
      Disease onset typically occurs post-puberty, often in the second and third decades of life, and there is a correlation between the earlier onset of HS and a more extensive and widespread disease [12]. Furthermore, diagnosis of the condition is often delayed, especially in cases categorized as ‘mild’ and intermittent, the primary inflammatory nodules being commonly misdiagnosed as furuncles [13]. On top of that, the lack of a specific diagnostic test demands a meticulous clinical assessment for the diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa. The diagnosis relies on the presence of typical lesions, typical topography, and chronicity and recurrences [2]. Diagnostic criteria, including the Hurley staging system and the International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4), aid in categorizing disease severity and guiding treatment decisions. 
      The Hurley clinical staging system is commonly employed to categorize patients with HS into three levels of disease severity: Stage I: formation of abscesses (single or multiple) without skin tunnels or cicatrization/scarring; Stage II: recurrent abscesses accompanied by skin tunnels and scarring, with single or multiple lesions widely separated; and Stage III: widespread or nearly widespread involvement, or the presence of multiple interconnected skin tunnels and abscesses across the entire affected area [14]. The majority of HS patients typically fall under stage I disease [15].
      IHS4 represents a validated instrument for dynamically evaluating the severity of hidradenitis suppurativa. IHS4 is determined by tallying the number of nodules (multiplied by 1), abscesses (multiplied by 2), and draining tunnels (multiplied by 4). A cumulative score of 3 or below indicates mild disease, 4–10 denotes moderate severity, and 11 or higher indicates severe HS [16]. By incorporating these criteria, IHS4 offers clinicians a standardized framework for assessing and monitoring HS severity, facilitating improved treatment decisions and patient management strategies.
      Managing hidradenitis suppurativa necessitates a nuanced, multimodal approach, reflecting the chronic and relapsing nature of the disease. Lifestyle modifications, encompassing weight loss and smoking cessation, emerge as foundational pillars of disease management [17]. The severity of the disease has a significant impact on the approach to treatment. 
      In milder cases (Hurley stage I), therapy aims to reduce the burden of the disease (i.e., to limit the development of lesions and inhibit the progression of the disease) and to improve acute, symptomatic lesions. The treatment consists of topical and systemic antibiotics that target bacterial colonization, mitigating inflammation [18]. Although the initial therapy in these cases consists generally of oral tetracyclines, topical clindamycin is occasionally considered and might serve as a viable initial approach for individuals with mild disease. Oral antiandrogenic medications and metformin represent supplementary treatment choices that can be employed independently or in combination with antibiotics. Further measures for managing symptomatic inflamed nodules encompass intralesional corticosteroid injections, punch debridement (partial unroofing), and the application of topical resorcinol [19].
      A spectrum of interventions comes into play for moderate to severe disease (Hurley stage II or III). Oral antibiotic therapy, intralesional corticosteroid injections, systemic immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies—the latter targeting specific inflammatory pathways—showcase efficacy in controlling disease progression. Furthermore, surgical options, including drainage of abscesses, surgical unroofing, and excision of involved tissue, prove beneficial in refractory cases, although necessitating carefully weighing risks and benefits [20].
      In this case report we present the case of a 20-year-old male known to have ulcerative proctitis and diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2020, for which he underwent two surgical interventions of incision and drainage in another service, various topical treatments (clindamycin 1% solution, resorcinol 15% cream and topical antiseptic washes), and systemic treatments (oral doxycycline), with periods of remission, recurrent flares and persistent worsening of symptoms in recent months. This case report will outline the surgical treatment options chosen, the decisions made, and the subsequent outcome for our patient. By presenting this case, our intention is to underscore the significance of possessing a thorough understanding of this intricate condition. Such understanding is pivotal in devising more effective management strategies, especially for patients grappling with refractory disease.
    
    
      2. Detailed Case Description
      We present a case involving a 20-year-old male, a non-smoker with a normal BMI known with ulcerative proctitis and diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurativa in 2020, who sought clinical evaluation and specialized treatment in our clinic. 
      In 2015, the patient received a diagnosis of mild ulcerative proctitis and underwent a four-week treatment regimen of topical mesalamine at a daily dose of 1 g, leading to subsequent remission of the disease. Since then, there has been a single episode of disease relapse, effectively managed with topical mesalamine without the necessity for ongoing maintenance therapy.
      The onset of HS symptoms occurred three years before. Since then, the patient has undergone a range of treatments: two surgical interventions of incision and drainage in another service, various topical treatments (clindamycin 1% solution, one application per day, resorcinol 15% cream, one application per day, and topical antiseptic washes) and systemic treatments (oral doxycycline 50 mg once daily for three months), with periods of remission and recurrent flares, without managing to obtain the complete remission of the disease.
      At the current presentation, the dermatological clinical exam reveals typical lesions of HS located in both of the patient’s axillae. In the left axilla, we observed two skin tunnels, one inflammatory nodule, and a thick, linear, rope-like band of scarring (Figure 1a). On the other hand, in the right axilla, we described one solitary skin tunnel and two deep-seated inflamed nodules with minimal scarring (Figure 1b). Following the extent and severity of lesions, the patient was classified as having Hurley stage II disease and an IHS4 score of 15. 
      In instances where the prevention of new lesions proves unsuccessful and medical therapy for established and growing lesions is ineffective, surgery becomes the acknowledged approach for managing hidradenitis suppurativa. Considering this, in the current context of our patient’s presentation, we opted for the surgical management of the axillary lesions.
      Initially, we conducted the surgical treatment of lesions localized in the left axilla under localized anesthesia using lidocaine 1% (Figure 2a). We performed the surgical unroofing of two skin tunnels (Figure 2b) and the punch debridement of one inflammatory nodule (Figure 2c). The punch debridement procedure utilized a 5 mm circular punch instrument to excise the isolated inflammatory nodule, along with a minimal amount of surrounding tissue. 
      In the context of the surgical unroofing technique, the procedure commenced with the delineation of the affected area followed by local anesthesia administration (adrenaline was utilized to prolong the duration of action). Due to the absence of a discernible sinus tract opening, a surgical entry point was established through the overlying skin. A guiding probe was introduced through the surgical entry point and meticulously navigated along the entire length of the sinus tract. Subsequently, an incision was made along the probe’s trajectory, resulting in the detachment of the upper portion of the sinus tract. The entire roof of each tract was meticulously excised, and both the base and margins were explored for concealed entrances to other tunnels. Cellular debris at the base of the tract was debrided, along with any superficial scar tissue and granulation tissue, thereby aiding in the elimination of the biofilm lining the tunnel. Superficial curettage resulted in a uniform, bleeding lesion bed at the subcutaneous level.
      After the procedures, the wounds were allowed to heal by secondary intention (Figure 2d), using just some dressing pads with a silicone wound contact layer. Following the intervention, the patient was prescribed a course of antibiotic therapy consisting of Cefuroxime 500 mg, taken twice daily for a duration of 5 days. The patient was given detailed instructions regarding the wound care regimen to be followed at home, which involved gently cleansing the area with an antiseptic solution, followed by the application of a moist dressing containing a neutral ointment, and sealing with a superabsorbent silicon-lined dressing. The patient diligently followed this home care protocol for 2 weeks. After the follow-up assessment, we advised the patient to apply another ointment with antibacterial and scar-reducing properties, containing silver sulfadiazine. 
      The patient attended follow-up appointments at two weeks (Figure 3a) and four weeks (Figure 3b) post operation, demonstrating a favorable progression of the lesions with no indication of inflammation or infection.
      Subsequently, we performed the surgical management of the lesions localized in the right axilla, performing the surgical unroofing of one skin tunnel and the punch debridement of two inflammatory nodules (Figure 4a), leaving the wounds to heal by secondary intention (Figure 4b). The patient attended follow-up appointments at two weeks (Figure 4c) and four weeks (Figure 4d) post-operation, also showing a favorable evolution. Six months post intervention, the patient is in total remission without any new HS lesions in the axillary region or any other areas. 
    
    
      3. Discussion
      Several risk factors have been statistically established as contributing to the development of hidradenitis suppurativa. Factors such as genetic susceptibility, mechanical stresses on the skin, obesity, smoking, dietary habits, and hormonal influences are frequently mentioned as potential contributors linked to the onset or worsening of HS. Our case diverges, as the patient lacked any of these factors mentioned. He was a non-smoker with a normal BMI, maintained a healthy dietary habit, and had no familial history of genetic susceptibility to the condition.
      Most notably, our patient was known to have mild ulcerative proctitis, diagnosed in 2015 and, at presentation, in clinical remission after the treatment with topical mesalamine. Several studies indicate a correlation between hidradenitis suppurativa and inflammatory bowel disease [9]. Earlier research suggested that the association between HS and IBD was present only in Crohn’s disease [21], with no apparent link to hidradenitis suppurativa in ulcerative colitis [22]. However, this notion has since been disproved, as subsequent studies are increasingly revealing a correlation between HS and ulcerative colitis as well. The most recent study is that of Bingzhou Bao et al., in 2023; theirs was a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study proving a robust causal relationship between IBD of both subtypes (CD and UC) and HS [23]. Concerning the pathophysiological aspect, there is some evidence indicating that IBD and HS share common clinical manifestations [24], genetic predisposition, and immunological profiles [22]; however, further research is needed to elucidate the pathophysiology of the causal connection between IBD and HS.
      As far as treatment is concerned, our patient underwent a variety of interventions to manage the disease. He reported having undergone two surgical procedures involving incision and drainage in another service but experienced a swift recurrence of the lesions. Currently, it has been demonstrated that the customary practice of incision and drainage (I&D) for individual nodules is deemed ineffective and unsuitable for managing hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) [25]. I&D offers only temporary relief, and as it fails to address the actively growing tissue, lesions treated in this manner often experience recurrence [26].
      Our patient was classified as having Hurley stage II disease. In this stage of HS, the primary therapeutic strategy to reduce the disease burden involves using oral antibiotics, typically oral tetracyclines or a combination of oral clindamycin and rifampin [27]. Our patient had previously undergone a three-month course of oral doxycycline at a daily dosage of 50 mg, yielding no substantial improvement in the lesions. Typically, doxycycline is prescribed at a recommended dosage of 100 mg, administered once to twice daily [28]. The suboptimal response to the treatment observed in our patient could be attributed to the lower dosage employed during the course. 
      On the other hand, for the treatment of acute, symptomatic lesions, additional interventions are necessary that may consist of intralesional corticosteroid injections [29], punch debridement, unroofing [30], and topical resorcinol [31]. For our patient, intermittent use of topical resorcinol 15% cream was employed to address newly inflamed nodules, resulting in temporary alleviation of pain; however, unfortunately, upon discontinuation of the medication there was a rapid recurrence of symptoms. In our case, the various topical and systemic treatments resulted in periods of remission and recurrent flares without obtaining a complete remission of the disease. In this instance, there are alternative medical treatment options to consider, including biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors like adalimumab [32] and infliximab [33], the interleukin (IL) 17A inhibitor secukinumab [34], and oral acitretin (for patients not of childbearing potential) [27]. However, these treatments were not deemed necessary in our case as the lesions were localized, and the patient was considered suitable for surgical management of the disease.
      A diverse array of surgical techniques are employed in the treatment of patients with hidradenitis suppurativa. These methods can be customized based on factors such as disease stage, defect size, bacterial contamination level, anatomical location, and the consideration of scar placement and potential for revision. The most-used surgical techniques are punch debridement with a 5 to 7 mm punch biopsy instrument and surgical unroofing, which involves removal of the superficial portion of the lesion [35] followed by closure by secondary intention [36]; these techniques were also used in our case. For more severe cases, extensive excision may be necessary to address a region affected by chronic or widespread hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage III) when conservative medical and surgical interventions prove ineffective [37]. 
      In our case, the surgical intervention yielded outstanding results. At the moment, more than six months post surgical treatment, the patient remains free of any recurrence of lesions. This affirms the effectiveness of surgical methods as an impactful approach for managing moderate-stage hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage II). This strategy proves particularly advantageous for patients with inflammatory nodules and skin tunnels that do not respond to traditional topical or systemic therapies.
    
    
      4. Conclusions
      Based on a thorough case analysis, the patient under consideration exhibited no apparent common risk factors for developing HS, with the only noteworthy association being the diagnosis of ulcerative proctitis. This correlation underscores the complexity of the disease and highlights the interplay of genetic, immunological, and environmental factors in the development of this disorder. Despite being unresponsive to initial topical and systemic therapy, the patient responded remarkably well to the surgical management of the disease. The present case underlines the importance of surgical procedures in managing moderate-stage hidradenitis suppurativa (Hurley stage II). This comprehensive exploration, spanning the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, staging, diagnosis, and most of all the surgical treatment of HS, underscores the importance of thoroughly understanding this complex condition for a more effective management strategy, especially in patients with refractory disease. As we navigate the intricacies of HS, a better patient-centered approach emerges, promising improved outcomes and enhanced quality of life for those grappling with this enigmatic condition.

Title: Late bedtime was associated with increased androgen and reduced lean mass in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a cross-sectional study

Abstract: BackgroundWhile the specific effects of bedtime on androgen levels and lean muscle mass remain understudied, circadian misalignment and sleep disturbances have been well-established as risk factors for various metabolic disorders. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between bedtime, androgen-associated traits, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)-based lean mass (LM) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).MethodsThis cross-sectional study recruited 899 reproductive-aged women with PCOS from the PCOS subspecialty clinic at Shanghai Tenth People’s Hospital, and finally, 636 women were included in the study. Anthropometric, metabolic, sex and reproductive hormonal characteristics, and body fat and lean composition measured by DEXA were collected. The information on bedtime was adapted from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and bedtime was categorized into three aspects: early bedtime (≤ 23:00), intermediate bedtime (> 23:00 to 24:00), and late bedtime (> 24:00) according to the time of falling asleep.ResultsThe study included 636 women with PCOS (mean age 27.50 ± 4.93 years; mean body mass index [BMI] 25.00 ± 5.46 kg/m²), with 24.4% having early bedtime (≤ 23:00), 36.8% intermediate bedtime (> 23:00 to 24:00), and 38.8% late bedtime (> 24:00). After adjusting for age in covariance analysis, the late bedtime group had fewer annual menstrual cycles and higher total testosterone (TT), and the intermediate bedtime group had higher anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) than the early bedtime group. Compared with the early and intermediate bedtime groups, those with late bedtime had higher androstenedione (AD) levels. After controlling possible confounding factors (age, BMI, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, alanine aminotransferase, triglyceride, and serum uric acid), multiple liner regression analysis found that compared with early bedtime, late bedtime was independently associated with higher levels of TT and AD, meanwhile, intermediate bedtime was independently associated with higher levels of AMH. Following further adjustment for the above confounders and TT, late bedtime was independently correlated to reduced muscle mass index and appendicular muscle mass index compared with early bedtime.ConclusionThis study provided novel insight that late bedtime (after 24:00) was independently related to elevated androgenic hormones and reduced LM in individuals with PCOS.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s13048-025-01730-2.

Body: Introduction
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multidimensional endocrine and metabolic disorder impacting 11–13% of women in reproductive years [1]. Hyperandrogenism is one of the critical features of PCOS and induces steroid secretion defects, obesity, hirsutism, acne, androgenetic alopecia, and thus great psychological stress [2].
      In addition to hormonal imbalance and metabolic disorders, the role of sleep should be highlighted in PCOS. Women with PCOS are at elevated risk of sleep problems and related clinical comorbidities [3]. Bedtime, as a symbol of the congruence of circadian rhythm and sleep, is significantly related to a range of metabolic abnormalities [4]. Staying up late (SUL) is characterized as an occurrence in which the average time to fall asleep occurs after 23:00 throughout the 6 months before admission [5]. Previous studies showed that SUL was more prevalent in women with PCOS than in control groups [6]. Since the endocrine system activity is crucial in maintaining sleep-wake cycles, and metabolic disturbances are prominent in PCOS, it is conceivable that PCOS disrupts sleep or that there are more intricate interrelationships.
      Though excess adipose tissue has primarily been emphasized, the quantity of lean mass (LM) is a critical factor in the regulation of insulin-dependent glucose uptake and may be linked to cardiometabolic dysregulation (e.g., insulin resistance [IR] and type 2 diabetes) in PCOS [7]. LM represents a clinically significant body composition parameter in PCOS. Current evidence has yielded contradictory results regarding the status of LM in PCOS versus controls [8–10]. Studies have elucidated that sleep-related factors are associated with variations in sex hormones and skeletal muscle mass in the general population [11–13]. However, to our knowledge, there are no epidemiological studies that have specifically examined the relationship between sleep and LM in women with PCOS.
      In this cross-sectional study, we examined sleep behaviors assessed by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and specific bedtime characteristics while investigating the compromised effects of various bedtimes on the level of androgenic hormones and variability of LM in women with PCOS to better delineate any need for targeted interventions that effectively prevent or postpone the onset of hyperandrogenism and muscle loss in this clinical population.
    
    
      Methods
      
        Participants and study design
        This cross-sectional study was conducted on 899 women with PCOS who were admitted to the PCOS subspecialty clinic at Shanghai Tenth People’s Hospital. The diagnosis of PCOS was based on the 2003 Rotterdam criteria [14], and two senior consultant-level physicians reviewed all patients to ensure they met the Rotterdam criteria. We excluded participants who were < 18 or > 45 years old (n = 47); those without information about bedtime data (n = 102); those without dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) data (n = 75); and those without covariate data (n = 37). Finally, 636 participants with PCOS were included. The data presented includes participants from our observational study (NCT05063383). Upon approval of the study protocol by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Tenth People’s Hospital (approval number: SHSY-IEC-4.1/21–227/01), all participants in this study signed the informed consent form.
      
      
        Clinical and biochemical assessment
        A well-trained researcher collected information on anthropometric measurements. Face-to-face interviews were conducted for each subject to gather socio-demographic and sleep information. The Ferriman-Gallwey score and menstrual condition were recorded. Participants underwent measurements of weight, height, waist circumference (WC), and hip circumference (HC) by using a calibrated scale after removing their shoes and heavy clothing. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight (kg) divided by height2 (m2). The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was calculated as WC divided by HC. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured after resting for at least 15 minutes. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) were assessed by trained operators using transient elastography (FibroScan 502, Echosens, Paris, France). Following the manufacturer’s protocols, all participants underwent at least 10 valid measurements after a minimun of 3 hours of fasting.
        Fasting blood samples were collected by trained nurses following standardized protocols, with subsequent biochemical analyses performed by certified laboratory technicians using automated analyzers under strict quality control measures. Venous blood was drawn in the morning following at least 10 hours of overnight fasting. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS), glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), creatinine (CR), serum uric acid (SUA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) levels were assessed by using a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, with evaluations conducted at 2 hours post-ingestion. Sex and reproductive hormones, including luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), androstenedione (AD), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), were also measured. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was computed using the following equation: [FPG (mmol/L) × FINS (mU/L)]/22.5 [15].
        Renal (CR, BUN, SUA) and hepatic (ALT, AST, CAP, LSM) parameters were included to evaluate metabolic comorbidities in PCOS, such as renal dysfunction, hyperuricemia, liver injury, and liver fibrosis progression, all of which may be relevant to bedtime or muscle metabolism.
      
      
        Subjective sleep information
        Sleep behaviors were determined using the PSQI. The PSQI is a self-reported questionnaire that assesses seven components of sleep, including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. A global PSQI score greater than 5 indicates poor sleep quality [16, 17]. Bedtime refers specifically to the self-reported time of falling asleep each night and it was calculated by using the questions “During the past month, what time have you usually gone to bed at night?” and “During the past month, how long (in minutes) has it usually take you to fall asleep each night?”, which were adapted from the PSQI [16], and has been validated in previous studies [18–21]. As SUL is defined as a consistent bedtime after 23:00 for at least 6 months [5], and combined with the average time to fall asleep in our study, we divided bedtime into three levels: ≤23:00, > 23:00 to 24:00, > 24:00 and they are marked as early bedtime, intermediate bedtime, and late bedtime, respectively.
      
      
        DEXA analysis
        Body fat and lean-related composition were determined using DEXA (APEX 4.5.0.2, Hologic, USA). The fat measures used in this study were total body fat percentage, total fat mass (FM), trunk FM, and appendicular FM. The LM measurement used in this analysis encompassed the following: total LM, trunk LM, muscle mass index (LM/height2), and appendicular muscle mass index (appLM/height2) [22]. Appendicular LM was defined as the sum of the LM of the bilateral upper and lower limbs. The latter were indices based on the total LM or appendicular LM, not on the body weight, and were standardized by height that can be calculated with the software provided by the manufacturer.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        The results were displayed for each normally distributed continuous variable as the mean with the standard deviation. Continuous variables in three-group comparisons were performed by using analysis of covariance, with age as the covariate, followed by post hoc pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni method. The multiple linear regression analysis of the association between bedtime and reproductive hormones or regional body LM was performed by using three adjustment models: model 1 adjusted for age and BMI; model 2 additionally adjusted for HOMA-IR, ALT and TG; model 3 further adjusted for SUA and TT. We included these potential covariates with p < 0.20 in univariate analysis [23], as well as clinically plausible factors, but excluded similar variables to avoid multicollinearity. All statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS version 25.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
      
    
    
      Results
      
        Anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of patients with PCOS stratified by the bedtime category
        In the study, 636 subjects with PCOS were eligible for the inclusion criteria with available bedtime and DEXA data (Fig. 1). Approximately 24.4% (155/636) of women with PCOS had early bedtime (≤ 23:00), 36.8% (234/636) had intermediate bedtime (> 23:00 to 24:00), and 38.8% (247/636) had late bedtime (> 24:00). Anthropometric and metabolic parameters of patients with PCOS categorized by the bedtime were given in Table 1. Women in the late bedtime group had fewer annual menstrual cycles than those in the early bedtime group. There were no significant differences in WHR, Ferriman-Gallwey score, blood pressure, glucose and insulin metabolism, lipid profiles, and hepatic and renal characteristics after adjustment for age among the three groups.

        The results of sex and reproductive hormonal characteristics among the three groups were shown in Fig. 2, using the violin plot. Compared with participants in the early bedtime category, those in the late bedtime category showed significantly higher levels of TT, while individuals with intermediate bedtime had greater values for AMH. Meanwhile, compared with women in the early bedtime and intermediate bedtime groups, women in the late bedtime group had higher levels of AD. Levels of LH, FSH, FT, DHEA, and SHBG were comparable after adjustment for age among the three groups.

        PSQI components of patients with PCOS stratified by the bedtime category
        Our analysis of sleep quality patterns in women with PCOS revealed clinically significant variations across the bedtime category. Using the PSQI global score > 5 cutoff, 68% of participants exhibited poor sleep quality (data not shown). The comparative analysis demonstrated that participants with late bedtime (> 24:00) showed consistently impaired sleep profiles relative to those with early bedtime (≤ 23:00) and intermediate bedtime (> 23:00 to 24:00), manifesting in: (1) markedly worse subjective sleep quality (1.45 ± 0.97 vs. 1.05 ± 0.79, 1.45 ± 0.97 vs. 1.10 ± 0.67, respectively; p < 0.001), (2) significantly prolonged sleep latency (1.37 ± 1.03 vs. 0.95 ± 0.89, 1.37 ± 1.03 vs. 1.09 ± 0.89, respectively; p < 0.001), (3) significantly short sleep duration (0.71 ± 0.72 vs. 0.42 ± 0.68, 0.71 ± 0.72 vs. 0.51 ± 0.62, respectively; p < 0.001), (4) more pronounced sleep disturbances (1.33 ± 1.45 vs. 1.08 ± 0.56, p = 0.038), and (5) more pronounced daytime dysfunction (1.91 ± 0.96 vs. 1.49 ± 0.99, 1.91 ± 0.96 vs. 1.65 ± 0.90, respectively; p < 0.001). Notably, the late bedtime (> 24:00) group displayed the highest mean PSQI score (7.18 ± 3.52), substantially exceeding the threshold for poor sleep quality. While habitual sleep efficiency (p = 0.880) and use of sleep medication (p = 0.245) showed no significant difference, all other PSQI components exhibited statistically significant variations among the groups (all p < 0.05), indicating that bedtime may systematically influence multiple dimensions of sleep health in the PCOS population (Table 2).

        Anthropometric, metabolic, sex and reproductive hormonal characteristics, body composition, and sleep quality components of patients with PCOS stratified by BMI
        According to the Asian BMI classification [24], underweight was < 18.5 kg/m2, normal weight was 18.5 to < 23 kg/m2, overweight was 23 to < 25 kg/m2, and obesity was ≥ 25 kg/m2. The data were presented as subgroups regarding the underweight group (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), the normal weight group (18.5 ≤ BMI < 23 kg/m2), and the overweight/ obese group (BMI ≥ 23 kg/m2) in the Supplementary Table 1. After adjusting for age, participants in the overweight/obese group had lower levels of menstrual cycles, LH, SHBG, and higher levels of SBP, DBP, FPG, PPG, FINS, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, TG, LDL-c, SUA, ALT, CAP, FT than those in the underweight and normal weight group. The overweight/obese group showed significantly lower levels of HDL-c and AMH, and higher levels of AST, LSM, and TT than the normal weight group. No significant differences in the mean Ferriman-Gallwey score, TC, CR, BUN, AD, and DHEA were observed among the three groups. The characteristics of body composition were significantly different in different BMI subgroups. There were no significant differences in the score of PSQI components (except for use of sleeping medication) among the three groups.
      
      
        Association between bedtime and reproductive hormones or regional LM in PCOS
        To investigate the influence of bedtime on reproductive hormones or regional LM variability in PCOS, we performed the multiple linear regression analysis with adjustments for different potential confounding factors (Table 3). With adjustment for age and BMI (model 1), late bedtime was significantly associated with higher TT (β = 0.206, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.052 to 0.359, p = 0.009) and AD (β = 0.807, 95% CI: 0.242 to 1.372, p = 0.005) when compared with early bedtime, and both intermediate and late bedtime was significantly associated with higher AMH (β = 1.180, 95% CI: 0.133 to 2.227, p = 0.027; β = 1.043, 95% CI: 0.032 to 2.054, p = 0.043, respectively) when compared with early bedtime. Immediately after, in model 3 with adjustment for age, BMI, HOMA-IR, ALT, TG, and SUA, late bedtime was independently associated with higher TT (β = 0.197, 95% CI: 0.019 to 0.375, p = 0.030) and AD (β = 0.908, 95% CI: 0.263 to 1.552, p = 0.006), and intermediate bedtime was independently associated with higher AMH (β = 1.380, 95% CI: 0.243 to 2.518, p = 0.018) when compared with early bedtime. Concerning regional LM, in model 1, late bedtime was significantly correlated to reduced LM/height2 and appLM/height2 as compared with early bedtime (β=-0.634, 95% CI: -1.051 to -0.218, p = 0.003; β=-0.186, 95% CI: -0.358 to -0.014, p = 0.034, respectively). After adjustment for all potential covariates (age, BMI, HOMA-IR, ALT, TG, SUA, and TT) (model 3), these robust correlations were still independently existent (β=-0.535, 95% CI: -0.885 to -0.186, p = 0.003, for LM/height2; β=-0.214, 95% CI: -0.399 to -0.029, p = 0.024, for appLM/height2). However, the relationships between all bedtimes and total LM / trunk LM were not statistically significant in models 1–3.

      Discussion
      This study examined the association between bedtime, androgen metabolites, and body LM detected by DEXA in the PCOS population. Our data demonstrated that late bedtime (> 24:00) was significantly associated with elevated serum concentrations of TT and AD, as well as reduced levels of LM/height2 and appLM/height2 in women with PCOS. There have been studies reported that androgen status is independently associated with sleep disorder risks in PCOS [25] and sleep debt will favor the loss of muscle mass [26], but no literature to date has reported the link between sleep and body LM in women with PCOS, highlighting a significant gap in current research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to clarify that late bedtime (> 24:00) has a significant adverse impact on LM in PCOS.
      Sleep issues are an important global public health concern and have a substantial impact on cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, anxiety, and depression [27–29]. Women with PCOS have been found to experience circadian rhythm and sleep disturbances due to some pathophysiological and psychosocial implications [6, 30, 31]. We herein focus on bedtime, which could increase adverse long-term cardiometabolic health risks in PCOS [32], and for its minimal financial investment and technical proficiency while simultaneously providing opportunities for immediate clinical intervention. Compared to 94.25% reported in other literature [32], we found that 75.6% of the participants with PCOS had the habit of SUL. Simon et al. showed that poor sleep behaviors were related to metabolic disturbances and more metabolic syndrome symptoms in adolescents with PCOS and obesity [33]. This differs from the findings presented here that there were no differences observed in metabolic dysfunctions, including blood pressure, glucose and insulin metabolism, lipid profiles, and hepatic and renal characteristics among the early, intermediate, and late bedtime groups. A possible explanation for this might be age and racial differences.
      Women with PCOS commonly suffer from menstrual disorders. Disrupted circadian rhythmicity may impair the secretion of reproductive hormones, thereby leading to menstrual irregularity [34]. Our findings were in accordance with recent studies [35, 36] indicating that SUL resulted in decreased annual menstrual cycles. It was suggested that biological clock disruption contributed to androgen excess in PCOS [37]. Specifically, our results showed that women with PCOS with late bedtime (> 24:00) had higher TT and AD concentration when compared with those with early bedtime (≤ 23:00). Additionally, late bedtime was independently associated with increased TT and AD concentration. Although the effects of bedtime on androgen levels in PCOS or other populations have not been reported, our findings were similar to those of a previous study by Nagata et al., who demonstrated that undesirable sleep-related factors were associated with higher levels of TT in premenopausal women [13]. Simon et al. theorized that adolescent girls with PCOS exhibited modified melatonin secretion and circadian dysregulation, which were positively linked with serum testosterone concentration [38]. Furthermore, our data observed that the intermediate bedtime exhibited significantly higher AMH than the early bedtime, and the intermediate bedtime was independently related to higher AMH. This finding was contrary to a previous study, which indicated that poor sleep quality, as evaluated by the PSQI, was associated with decreased levels of AMH in general reproductive women [18]. The exact reason is unclear, but it may be related to the fact that all participants had PCOS status in our study, and further studies with more focus on the relationship between bedtime and AMH in PCOS are therefore needed. In contrast to earlier findings [18, 25, 39], no differences in LH, FSH, FT, DHEA, and SHBG were detected among all bedtime groups. Taken together, our findings were generally in line with earlier research indicating that sleep problems were increasingly recognized as risk factors for women’s reproductive health [40–42] and the underly mechanisms may be genetics, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and insulin resistance [43].
      In our study, body fat-based analysis showed no statistically significant differences in total body fat percentage, total FM, trunk FM, and appendicular FM among all bedtime groups. This outcome was contrary to that of Thomas et al., who found that later sleep timing was related to a higher body fat percentage in people with overweight/obesity [44], and Xu et al., who found that short sleep duration was independently related to the increased regional body fat in general adults [45]. Further research involving larger patient samples and biological underpinnings is required to shed light on the relationship between sleep and body fat distribution in PCOS.
      
Increasing evidence has shown that subjective sleep quality assessments are independently associated with changes in muscle mass in older adults [11, 46, 47]. Given that LM relates directly to IR [48] and testosterone [49] in PCOS, it is essential to examine the potential relationship between bedtime and LM within this population. Existing literature reports an inseparable association between sleep and muscle [50, 51]. Although similar levels of total LM, trunk LM, LM/height2, and appLM/height2 after adjusting for age in participants stratified by bedtime category were observed, we further demonstrated that late bedtime (> 24:00) was associated with reduced levels of LM/height2 and appLM/height2 by conducting the multiple linear regression. Despite no epidemiologic data on the association between bedtime and LM in PCOS or other populations so far, several studies have examined relationships between other sleep metrics and muscle in the general population. Song et al. discovered that appLM/height2 decreased as the sleep quality deteriorated [52]. In a study involving the 20-59-year-old population, it was found that poor sleep quality was associated with an increased risk of pre-sarcopenia [53], a condition characterized by low skeletal muscle mass but normal muscle function [54]. Furthermore, a meta-analysis has shown that abnormal sleep duration is associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia, featured by skeletal muscle mass loss and decline in muscular function [54, 55]. Sleep problems may contribute to diminished LM through potential mechanisms based on prior studies. People with late sleep timing are often accompanied by changed circadian rhythm and thus disruptions in melatonin secretion, which may generate reactive oxygen species and damage proteins, lipids, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the human skeletal muscle, potentially contributing to muscle strength loss [56–58]. Furthermore, sleep problems may disrupt key hormonal pathways (e.g., insulin-like growth factor 1, insulin, growth hormone, testosterone, and cortisol) that modulate muscle fiber repair, strength, and function by suppressing anabolism while promoting catabolism in skeletal muscle [59].
      The main advantages of this study are that the present study is the first to describe the association between bedtime, androgenic hormones, and LM in women with PCOS and uses a gold standard DEXA for measuring lean muscle mass. However, our study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reported bedtime data preclude the ability to make causal inferences. Further longitudinal studies incorporating objective sleep measurements are needed to confirm these associations and elucidate underlying mechanisms. Second, the current study only collected information on DEXA-based LM and did not deal with muscular function, indicating the need for additional research on this topic. Third, self-reported bedtime is prone to bias and may therefore yield inaccurate results. Finally, the absence of a non-PCOS group constrains the interpretation of the data from the PCOS cohort.
    
    
      Conclusion
      In conclusion, our cross-sectional study suggested that late bedtime (> 24:00) was independently associated with increased androgenic hormones and decreased lean muscle mass in the population with PCOS. These noteworthy findings corroborated the relationship between bedtime, androgen, and LM in reproductive-aged women with PCOS to underscore the significance of early sleep timing as a precaution against worsening hyperandrogenism and muscle mass loss.

Title: The Role of Microbiota in the Pathogenesis of Bullous Pemphigoid and Pemphigus Vulgaris: Evidence, Controversies, and Perspectives

Abstract: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) represent the most prevalent conditions among autoimmune bullous skin diseases, considered a major cause of severe morbidity and, in certain cases, mortality. The hallmark of the two diseases is the presence of autoantibodies directed against proteins located in the basement membrane of the skin, which determines the formation of blisters. In recent years, interest in the role of microbiota in relation to health-disease status has progressively increased. In particular, based on the gut–skin axis, accumulating evidence has emerged on the potential association between the composition and diversity of microbial communities in the gut, skin, and even in the oral cavity and the risk of developing BP and PV. Dysbiosis, characterized by a generally higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and a depletion of probiotics/beneficial species, might contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases. Despite the still limited number of studies and the need for further large-scale multicenter studies, the knowledge gathered so far is suggestive of a novel modifiable risk factor representing a potential target for adjuvant treatments of these disabling and life-threatening conditions.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Autoimmune bullous skin diseases, a major cause of severe morbidity and, in certain conditions, high mortality, embrace a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by an autoimmune response associated with loss of tolerance to skin adhesion molecules, leading to the formation of blisters and erosions in the skin and/or mucous membranes [1,2,3]. These skin disorders are classified into “pemphigoid diseases” and “pemphigus diseases” based on the level of blistering [2,3].
      Pemphigoid diseases present with subepidermal blisters and erosions resulting from the reaction of autoantibodies directed against hemidesmosomal antigens. Among pemphigoid variants, bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common form and the most frequent autoimmune blistering disease [3,4,5]. BP is a highly debilitating skin disorder that typically affects the elderly and is characterized by a distinctive eosinophilic infiltration and the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) and IgE autoantibodies to BP180 (collagen XVII) and BP230 (dystonin) [3,6,7,8,9,10]. The incidence of BP appears to be increasing over time, and estimates may greatly vary across populations, likely due to differences in underlying risk factors for BP (e.g., neurological conditions such as dementia, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, and stroke) and life expectancy [3,9,11]. Indeed, a meta-analysis published in 2022 reported a cumulative incidence of BP of 8.2 per million people and an incidence rate of 34.2 million person–years, with Europe as the largest contributor (10.3 per million people) [9]. BP negatively impacts the quality of life and has been associated with a three-fold increased risk of death within two years from diagnosis compared with matched disease-free controls [9,12]. Primary treatment of BP includes topical or systemic corticosteroids, depending on the extension of disease, combined with immunosuppressants or non-immunosuppressive agents, although other more specific immunomodulatory drugs (i.e., dimethyl fumarate) and new biological therapies are currently under investigation [13].
      Pemphigus vulgaris (PV), pemphigus foliaceous, and paraneoplastic pemphigus are considered the main forms of pemphigus diseases. A pivotal role in their pathogenesis is represented by the development of IgG autoantibodies directed against desmosomal cadherins desmoglein (Dsg)1 and Dsg3, glycoproteins involved in the cohesion between skin keratinocytes. Autoantibodies against Dsg1 and Dsg3 induce acantholysis, i.e., loss of keratinocyte cell adhesion, which determines the formation of intraepithelial flaccid blisters [2,14,15,16,17]. In addition to being considered the most serious clinical form of pemphigus, PV is also the most widespread type, accounting for approximately 70% of cases overall [14]. Despite its development at any age, with a higher frequency recorded in children and the elderly, the onset of PV generally occurs between the ages of 40 and 60 [18]. A recent meta-analysis estimated an incidence rate of 2.83 per million person–years for PV, with no significant differences by sex, and Southern Asia showed the highest rate among the subcontinents (4.94 per million person–years) [19]. While the advent of corticosteroids in the 1950s and the subsequent increasing use of adjuvant immunosuppressants have substantially reduced mortality in PV to less than 5% [15], PV remains a life-threatening disease due to complications of therapy (severe infections, cardiovascular disease, pneumonia, septicemia, malignancies) with mortality among patients that is approximately 3 times higher than that of the general population [16,19,20]. In this context, the introduction of rituximab, the monoclonal antibody targeting the CD20 antigen of B lymphocytes, represents a promising therapeutic option for the treatment of PV and is currently recommended as the first line for new-onset moderate to severe forms [13].
      Human skin represents the largest epithelial surface that can act primarily as a mechanical and microbial barrier against environmental microorganisms and harmful substances, preventing potential infections and diseases [21,22,23]. Meanwhile, with an average total mucosal surface of approximately 32 m2, the adult human gastrointestinal tract hosts the highest number of microorganisms, whose abundance has been estimated from 107 in the stomach up to 1014 microbial cells per gram of content in the large intestine (vs. 1012 microbial cells located in the skin) [22,24,25]. A huge number of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and viruses, collectively known as the microbiota (microbiome instead defines the total amount of microbial genomes), inhabit the human body, and the gut microbiota, composed of over 1000 species of bacteria, exerts the most relevant functions, namely nutrient extraction, metabolic regulation, immunity, and vitamin production [26,27]. The “gut–skin axis” is a new concept referring to the dual relationship between gut microbiota and skin health [28]. Therefore, the status of intestinal dysbiosis (the disruption of the balance in terms of the diversity and composition of the intestinal microbial community, which causes the “leaky gut syndrome” and the consequent deterioration of the relationship between the microbiota and the immune system) is associated with an increased risk of irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel diseases, obesity, cardiovascular disease, central nervous system disorders, cancer, and various autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type 1 diabetes, celiac disease, and autoimmune thyroid disease [17,29,30,31,32]. In addition, gut dysbiosis has been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune dermatoses, including alopecia areata, acne vulgaris, atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, psoriasis, rosacea, and vitiligo [17,23,30,33]. Several immune disorders have been linked to changes in the abundance of commensal bacteria and levels of microbiota-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) [34]. Indeed, while under physiological conditions, SCFAs communicate with the immune system and ensure immune homeostasis, perturbations of commensal gut bacteria resulting from the disruption of the integrity of the intestinal barrier, which normally functions against pathogens and segregates microbes from host cells, increase susceptibility to infections, reduces SCFA level, lead to dysregulation of immune responses, and ultimately lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance [35]. Over time, chronic intestinal dysbiosis can cause bacteria and their metabolites to cross the mucosal barrier and invade other organs, increasing the risk of various disorders [35].
      On the other hand, skin dysbiosis, resulting from the invasion of bacteria and other pathogens into the deeper skin layers or even into the systemic circulation, may lead to inflammation [32]. Importantly, the microbiota is also located in three other body districts (nasal and oral cavity, vagina), of which the oral cavity represents its second largest habitat and, as such, one of the most relevant interaction windows with the external environment [36,37]. Although the study of the oral microbiota is in its infancy, increasing evidence supports the influence of oral microbes on the development of systemic diseases by promoting an inflammatory response through oral infections or the colonization of microorganisms from the oral cavity into other organs or tissues (blood, brain, gut, heart, placenta, tumors) [37].
      Recently, based on the concept of the gut–skin axis, some observational studies have explored the potential association of gut, skin, and oral microbiota with BP and PV, speculating that they may act as additional risk factors and possible targets of new treatments for these autoimmune skin diseases (e.g., [17,38,39]). Therefore, in this comprehensive literature review, we summarized the up-to-date evidence on the relationship between microbiota and the onset of both BP and PV, discussing both promising and conflicting findings and plausible underlying biological mechanisms, thus paving the way for possible frontiers of future research.
    
    
      2. The Gut Microbiota: General Features
      The human gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic entity composed of approximately 100 trillion microorganisms, collectively weighing between 1 and 2 kg and encoding over 3 million genes, which are about 150 times the number of genes in the entire host genome [27,40,41]. Until a few decades ago, the properties and functions of the gut microbiota, as well as the host–microbiota interactions, were largely unknown due to limitations in examining non-cultivable microorganisms; however, recent advances in novel technologies such as 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing have provided an effective alternative method to microbial cultures to taxonomically characterize bacterial communities and identify the composition of the gut microbiota [42,43]. Indeed, the 16S rRNA gene encodes a highly conserved region among bacteria, which allows binding to universal primers, in addition to containing interspersed hypervariable regions that are unique to each bacterial species and thus allow their classification and characterization [40]. By targeting the 16S rRNA gene, third-generation full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing technology has enabled the identification of clusters known as Operational Taxonomic Units or Amplicon Sequence Variants, whose analysis provides information on the community diversity, richness, and evenness, as well as the degree of divergence between different sample types [44,45]. In contrast to 16S rRNA sequencing, which is a cost-effective method widely employed for characterizing the profile of complex microbial communities down to the genus level, metagenomic sequencing collects information on both the taxonomic composition and functional genes of ecosystems by sequencing the genomes of all species isolated from the entire microbial community [46,47].
      It has been estimated that up to 90% of the gut microbiota is represented by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, with the Firmicutes phylum being the most abundant, comprising more than 200 different genera and composed mainly of gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium, Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Enterococcus, and Ruminococcus), while Bacteroidetes are gram-negative bacteria primarily consisting of Bacteroides and Prevotella [48,49]. On the other hand, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia represent most of the residual portion of the intestinal microbial composition [49]. It is worth noting that the composition of the intestinal microbiota changes taxonomically not only throughout the gastrointestinal tract but also with gestational age, mode of delivery, feeding methods, and antibiotic treatment [48]. Additionally, the gut microbiota profile remains relatively stable throughout adulthood, although it may be subject to variations depending on age (people over 70 years of age can be affected by problems with digestion and nutrient absorption), lifestyle (medications, smoking, physical exercise, mental health), diseases (intestinal and extra-intestinal disorders), and, mainly, diet (both habitual diet and short-term dietary changes determine variations in the composition of the gut microbiota) [41,49,50]. Conversely, variations in the gut microbiota between individuals can be attributed to differences in enterotypes (individual-specific clusters of bacteria), ethnicity, body mass index, frequency of exercise, and dietary and cultural habits [48].
      The intestinal microbiota has multiple properties, e.g., protection, metabolic activities, and regulation and development of the immune system, as described below (see also Figure 1), through which it establishes close crosstalk with the intestine, influencing the health–disease status and the subsequent functioning of all organ systems (reviewed in [27,30,51,52]).
      
        2.1. The Crosstalk Between the Gut Microbiota and Intestinal Epithelial Cells
        The gut microbiota interacts with the intestinal epithelium, which consists of different populations with specific functions: columnar cells, which participate in the digestion process; Goblet cells, producing mucus and, by presenting antigens to dendritic cells located in the lamina propria, contribute to the formation of immune tolerance; Tuft cells, which participate in the removal of parasites from the intestinal lumen by producing interleukin (IL)-25; Paneth cells that regulate microbial diversity in the intestine through the secretion of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and growth factors; enteroendocrine cells producing peptides and hormones that stimulate peristaltic movements; microfold cells, which stimulate the immune system by binding antigens that are subsequently transported to dendritic cells; dendritic cells, which can promote an antigen-specific immune response by interacting with T cells; and B cells, which regulate the gut microbiota through IgA secretion [27,53].
        Overall, intestinal epithelium cells (IECs) form a cytoskeleton structure composed of tight and adherence junctions and desmosomes located along the lateral membrane, which confers mechanical strength between cells and ensures impermeability to the gut barrier, preventing the translocation of microorganisms from the intestinal lumen to the deep tissues [54]. Indeed, the intestinal mucus layer, which has the primary role of preserving intestinal homeostasis and whose thickness varies in the intestine (much higher in the large intestine than in the small intestine due to the density of microorganisms), is implicated in regulating the delivery of nutrients and drugs and protecting the host from mechanical attacks and food toxins [27,55]. The relationship between IECs and microbiota is bidirectional. In fact, while the microbiota contributes to the integrity of the intestinal barrier by participating in the stimulation of mucus secretion, the mucus layer, which contains mucin glycans that act as attachment sites and nutrients, represents a natural habitat for microorganisms and can also influence the composition of mucus-associated bacteria thanks to the glycosylation profile of mucin [54,55,56].
        The gut microbiota produces a series of metabolites having various functions in humans, some of which are identified as playing key roles in modulating IEC activity and preserving the gut epithelium barrier [57]. The bacterial fermentation of dietary fibers in the large intestine produces SCFAs, a group of organic compounds with less than six atoms of carbon mainly produced by Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and including acetate, propionate, and butyrate with a molar ratio of around 65, 20, and 15%, respectively [27,48,53,58]. Despite its lower abundance among SCFAs produced, butyrate is the preferred fuel source for IECs, contributing to 60–70% of their energy requirements, thereby promoting tight junction integrity, cell proliferation, and mucus secretion [59]. SCFAs amount reflects a healthy gut microbiota. Indeed, butyrate, used by colonocytes to generate energy, causes oxygen consumption that, by creating an anaerobic intestinal environment, prevents the invasion of pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella [52]. The amount of SCFAs can also control central appetite (primarily acetate), reduce weight gain (acetate and propionate), and regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis (propionate), reducing lipogenesis (acetate), and increasing the secretion of leptin (butyrate), a hormone that plays a fundamental role in energy balance and body adiposity [50,58,60].
        Together with SCFAs, gram-positive bacteria such as Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Enterococcus, and Lactobacillus, and gram-negative bacteria belonging to Bacteroides can synthesize secondary bile acids (deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid—LCA) from primary bile acids (BAs) [27,61]. BAs such as chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid, metabolites secreted by the liver, play a primary role in the digestion and absorption of lipids and the uptake of cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins [62,63]. Approximately 95% of BAs are reabsorbed by IECs and then excreted in the feces through deconjugation, dihydroxylation, and oxidation, while unabsorbed bile acids act as substrates for gut microbial metabolism [27,57,62,63].
        Recently, the gut microbiota has also emerged as a master regulator of tryptophan metabolism, an essential amino acid that is metabolized through three major pathways: (i) primarily through the kynurenine pathway, leading to the generation of kynurenine and other related compounds; (ii) conversion, to a lesser extent, into various indole derivatives; and (iii) the serotonin pathway for the synthesis of serotonin and melatonin [26]. Tryptophan-derived gut metabolites contribute to the maintenance of the gut barrier, while recent evidence indicates that, like butyrate, indole activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in IECs, leading to the enhancement of tight junctions [64,65]. Serotonin, a neurotransmitter primarily synthesized in the enterochromaffin cells (a subtype of enteroendocrine cells) of the gut, has also been reported to modulate gut microbiota composition [66]. At the same time, serotonin synthesis is, in turn, regulated by the relative levels of SCFAs, particularly butyrate [67].
      
      
        2.2. Interaction Between the Gut Microbiota and Immunity
        The gut microbiota establishes a close dual interplay with the innate immune system, and since this interaction is highly complex and dynamic, any perturbation in the composition of the gut microbiota or host–microbiota interfaces or dyshomeostasis in the immune system can potentially cause systemic dissemination of commensal microorganisms, increased susceptibility to infections, and an exaggerated immune response [68]. AMPs, a class of diverse compounds produced by Paneth cells and immune cells in the gastrointestinal tract, are key effectors of innate immunity, playing crucial roles both in the host defense against enteric infections and in the maintenance of immune tolerance to the gut microbiota [69]. While SCFAs regulate AMP expression, AMPs can modulate the composition of the gut microbiota, preserving species–specific bacterial communities [69,70]. Furthermore, Paneth cells, through the production of AMPs, promote the regeneration of RegIIIγ, a secreted antibacterial lectin, and the consequent segregation of the microbiota and IECs, avoiding potentially harmful and unnecessary immune responses [57,71]. SCFAs exert their effects on both the epithelial barrier function as well as on mucosal and systemic immunity through the direct inhibition of histone deacetylases, a class of enzymes capable of removing acetyl groups from histones and other protein regulatory factors [34,72]. SCFAs may also activate G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109A, which belong to one of the largest families of proteins that feature a conserved structure composed of seven transmembrane helices [34,52]. In particular, GPCR43 is a major target of SCFAs for the regulation of the immune system and control of inflammation, helping to prevent the development of various chronic inflammatory diseases [73].
        Gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT), which histologically embrace the appendix, crypt patches, isolated lymphoid follicles, mesenteric lymph nodes, and Peyer’s patches, represent the critical link between the non-specific immune response to the gut microbiota and the subsequent adaptive immune response, thus playing a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis between gut microorganisms and the immune system [51]. GALT is based on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on enteric bacteria via various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (located on the cell membrane and able to recognize exogenous PAMPs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) (cytosolic receptors specialized in defense against intracellular pathogens), and the activation of a downstream signaling cascade, which in turn leads to the secretion of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18) and chemokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha—TNF-α, CXCL8, and CCL10) [27,51,68,74]. Like AMPs in the small intestine, this mechanism serves as a major regulator of the microbiota in the large intestine [27]. TLRs, and in particular TLR5, in addition to being involved in host defense against pathogens, regulate the abundance of commensal microbes, while, conversely, TLR5 deletion causes microbial dysbiosis [75]. Similarly, myeloid differentiation primary response gene-88 (MyD88), an adapter protein localized on TLRs, regulates T cell differentiation and also promotes microbial homeostasis by stimulating IgA secretion, while its suppression is associated with an altered microbial composition [74,76].
        Notably, some NLRs give rise to multiprotein complexes known as inflammasomes, which, through cleavage and activation of caspase-1, lead to the activation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 in mature forms that, in turn, preserve the homeostasis of the gut microbiota [77]. NOD-pyrin domain-containing 6 (NLRP6), in particular, has been associated with the modulation of colonic microbial ecology and intestinal balance [68,78].
        Dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages, other key effectors in the innate immune response and distributed within the epithelium and intraepithelial layers, lamina propria, and structures of GALT, exert crucial functions of phagocytosis and antigen presentation to the adaptive immune system and are also involved in maintaining immune tolerance to commensal bacteria [51]. On the other hand, SCFAs can promote hematopoiesis of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and polarize macrophages through epigenetic modulation, as well as trigger different local immune responses of dendritic cells [51]. In the context of anti-inflammatory properties, SCFAs can also increase the production of antimicrobial peptides (e.g., calprotectin) by macrophages and regulate the chemotactic recruitment of neutrophils through both inhibition of HDAC activity and GPR43 signaling [34].
        Although less explored until recent years, accumulating evidence suggests the existence of a mutualistic relationship also between the intestinal microbiota and the adaptive immune system. Indeed, B cells produce a large array of IgA antibodies responsive to commensals [68], while the gut microbiota and SCFAs induce B cell differentiation and intestinal IgA secretion [34]. SCFAs also induce differentiation of T regulatory cells via both HDAC inhibition and the GPR43 pathway [34]. In particular, butyrate favors the differentiation of naïve T cells to effectors such as T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells, subsets of CD4+ regulatory T cells that, by releasing cytokines like IL-2, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22, TNF-α, and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), promote the survival, differentiation, and antitumor activities of CD8+ cytotoxic cells, the most powerful effectors against intracellular pathogens and cancerous cells [68,79,80]. Additionally, SCFAs have anti-inflammatory effects by influencing cytokine expression in T cells [34]. Butyrate induces the upregulation of IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta and suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines, i.e., IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, through the inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), a transcription factor involved in the regulation of immune responses, inflammation, cell proliferation, survival, and apoptosis [81,82].
      
    
    
      3. The Gut–Skin Axis
      Based on growing evidence suggesting that alterations in the gut microbiota may promote the development of diseases outside the gastrointestinal tract, including atherosclerosis, cardiometabolic diseases, hypertension, chronic kidney diseases, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and even inflammatory skin disorders, the concept of a gut–skin axis has also been postulated [25,83,84]. The gut microbiota composition appears to be associated with the development of psoriatic disease, with an increased F/B ratio, which could reflect the association of psoriasis with metabolic and cardiovascular comorbidities [85]. A non-negligible number of immune-mediated diseases, including psoriasis and pyoderma gangrenosum, are more frequently diagnosed among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, a group of disorders represented mainly by ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease, which result from interactions between genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers, and lifestyle/dietary factors [86,87]. Furthermore, atopic dermatitis has been associated with intestinal dysbiosis characterized by reduced microbial diversity and a decrease in commensal microbes like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which leads to an enhanced inflammatory response in the skin [88]. Likewise, in acne, a decrease in Cutibacterium in the skin is concurrent with reduced microbial diversity in the gut, which in turn may worsen the clinical severity of the cutaneous disease [88]. The connection between the skin and the gut appears to be mediated by the activities of immunological components and inflammatory mediators located between the two districts, as well as by neuroendocrine signaling [30,88]. While the microbiota is a key modulator of the immune system, the presence of pathogens or other host-specific factors (lifestyle, diet, antibiotics) can influence the composition and function of the gut microbiota by activating the immune system, thus leading to a decrease in the diversity of the microbial community, a loss of commensals, or an overgrowth of harmful microorganisms [22,30,89]. A decrease in SFCA producers caused by dysbiosis results in a proinflammatory state of the gut that affects the production of the mucus layer [30,84]. The increased permeability of the gut barrier facilitates the passage of microorganisms, together with their toxic metabolites and neurotransmitters, into the circulatory system and then into a variety of organs, including the skin [30,90] (Figure 2). In fact, SCFAs are believed to influence the predominance of certain skin microbiotic profiles, which subsequently induce cutaneous immune responses [90]. Furthermore, reduced diversity and richness of the gut microbiota, such as those that occur following a high-fat, low-fiber “Western diet”, are often related to alterations in the composition of the secondary BA pool that participates in the enterohepatic cycle and is involved in the immune–inflammatory response [91,92,93]. Thus, while at relatively low concentrations (e.g., <50 μM) secondary, BAs exert anti-inflammatory actions by primarily binding to the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5) in various organs, higher concentrations of these molecules (up to 1 mM) lead to detrimental effects on the intestinal epithelium, activating the NF-κB and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 signaling pathways (cascades regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, metabolism, and survival) and inducing the generation of reactive oxygen species, mutations, DNA damage, and apoptosis [61,94,95]. Patients with rosacea present an increase in circulating secondary BAs, particularly LCA, which, by activating the expression of TGR5 in keratinocytes, promotes the production of cytokines and chemokines [92].
      Similarly, diet, gut dysbiosis, or changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota (i.e., a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes—F/B ratio, recognized as a marker of normal/compromised intestinal homeostasis [96]) or damage to the intestinal barrier may lead to increased levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), synthesized in the liver from trimethylamine, a molecule resulting from the metabolism of phosphatidylcholine/choline, carnitine, betaine, dimethylglycine, and ergothioneine contained in dietary compounds, and mainly produced in the colon by Clostridia, Shigella, Proteus, and Aerobacter [97,98]. An increase in circulating TMAO triggers the activation of the NF-κB pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome, which plays a complex role in the innate immune response and inflammatory signaling [99]), upregulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines, adhesion molecules, and chemokines, and induces oxidative stress [100]. TMAO is indeed considered a marker of bacterial translocation and systemic inflammation and a prognostic factor for atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, recurrent ischemic events), metabolic syndrome, renal failure, and inflammatory skin diseases such as hidradenitis suppurativa, an auto-inflammatory skin disease generally associated with cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities [83,101,102,103].
      Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota causes alterations in the relationship between microbial tryptophan metabolism and the host intestinal immune system, resulting in dysregulation of kynurenine and serotonin pathways [26]. Disruption of tryptophan catabolism pathways may ultimately contribute to the development of inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome and other cardiovascular comorbidities, kidney disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, and cancer [26,104]. Although with conflicting results, levels of metabolites and enzymes of the kynurenine pathway are positively associated with psoriasis, probably due to an increased production of cytokines IL-17 and IL-22, leading to skin proliferation and development of psoriatic lesions [104].
      Disturbances in gut microbiota diversity also affect the production of neurotransmitters (e.g., γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline) [30]. Altered levels of neurotransmitters, in addition to being linked to a broad spectrum of immune-related neurological disorders, including developmental and psychiatric diseases and neurodegeneration, may also adversely influence the physiological functioning of the skin via the nervous system [30,105,106]. Indeed, binding of neurotransmitters to receptors expressed on immune cells located in the dermis and epidermis modulates the immune system response, promoting an inflammatory process characterized by differentiation of Th17 cells and secretion of proinflammatory molecules (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-23, IFN-γ, TNF-α), cell migration, vascular permeability, and mast cell degranulation, which ultimately may result in the onset of skin diseases, such as psoriasis [84,107,108].
      Free phenol and p-cresol metabolites of aromatic amino acids produced by certain pathogenic bacteria like Clostridium difficile in conditions of disturbed gut environment may enter the circulation and accumulate in the skin, where in vitro, they reduce the production of keratin, thereby affecting epidermal differentiation and skin barrier integrity [90,109]. A positive association of cresol levels with skin dryness and disruption of keratinization was also reported in adult women, where the daily use of prebiotics and probiotics reduced serum total phenol levels and restored healthy skin [110].
      Finally, excessive production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), recognized as a gaseous signaling molecule having anti-inflammatory functions at physiological levels, can negatively affect the intestinal mucosa, leading to alterations of the relative abundance, functions, and spatial organization of intestinal bacteria and disruption of mucus integrity through the breaking of mucus disulfide bonds [111,112]. H2S is produced from sulfur-containing dietary amino acids (e.g., cysteine, methionine, taurine) by sulfate-reducing bacteria in the gut and achieves its highest concentration in the colon (250 mM) [113,114]. Most of the effects of H2S are highly concentration-dependent, and while in normal skin conditions, it regulates vasodilatation and apoptosis, promotes keratinocyte differentiation, modulates pruritus, and suppresses inflammation, alterations in H2S production, induces the production of proinflammatory mediators and leukocyte activation, contributing to the pathogenesis of some skin disorders (psoriasis, melanoma, and other dermatoses) [115].
      Although the association between gut and skin microbial communities is an emergent area of research and the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota interfere with skin balance remain to be fully elucidated, current data on potential biological drivers involved in the gut–skin axis as well as skin disease risk (represented in Figure 2) indicate the direction for future studies to further investigate this relationship in order to promote both gut and skin health.
    
    
      4. The Gut Microbiota and the Relationship with Autoimmune Bullous Diseases
      As described in the previous section, gut microbiota dysbiosis can induce both local and systemic immune responses, thus potentially contributing to the development of autoimmune diseases, which, in addition to being considered among the major causes of morbidity and mortality, are collectively characterized by long-lasting debilitating symptoms, organ impairment, and high treatment costs [86,116,117]. The burden of BP and PV is substantial due to a variety of comorbidities due to viral and bacterial infections or long-term corticosteroid use, which result in high rates of hospitalization and increased risk of mortality [118,119]. Therefore, a deeper understanding of modifiable risk factors, including the composition and diversity of the gut microbiota, can help in discovering more effective and targeted treatments to improve the quality of life of patients with debilitating diseases.
      
        4.1. The Association of the Gut Microbiota with Bullous Pemphigoid
        The pathophysiological hallmark of BP is the production of autoantibodies directed against two structural components of hemidesmosomes (a highly specialized multiprotein complex that ensures firm adhesion between basal epithelial cells and the dermal extracellular matrix), BP230 and BP180 [120,121]. While genetic variations in the human leukocyte antigen system (encoding proteins involved in immune regulation) have been established as the most significant predisposing factors in BP, contributing to the loss of immune tolerance towards the two hemidesmosomal anchoring proteins, the imbalance between Th and Treg cells, the activation of toll-like receptors and of Th2- and Th17-related cytokines cascades, the latter maintaining the inflammatory response by inducing cytokine production, are responsible for antibody secretion in BP [4,121,122,123].
        To date, four studies have examined the gut microbiota’s impact on the development of BP (Table 1). The pilot study by Scaglione et al. [38] reported an underrepresentation of Proteobacteria in the gut microbiota of BP patients, with Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as the most abundant phyla, reflecting a similar composition to that of healthy subjects and with no significant differences from PV patients. In the study by Liu et al. [10], who recruited 66 pairs of BP patients and their controls matched for age, sex, and study center, participants were further sub-grouped by patients’ disease status (first diagnoses and relapsed cases) to assess the relationship between gut dysbiosis and BP disease activity. The authors observed both decreased richness and evenness as well as alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota in BP patients [10]. An enrichment of Flavonifractor and Flavonifractor plautii was detected in BP patients and relapsed cases, respectively, supporting the hypothesis that these microbial species can be associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, probably due to their ability to degrade beneficial anticarcinogenic flavonoids [10,124]. However, the enterobacterium Flavonifractor plautii can also abolish antigen-induced Th2 immune responses and attenuate inflammation by suppressing TNF-α expression and IL-17 signaling in the adipose tissues and intestine, respectively, leaving doubts about its real function [125,126,127]. In contrast, BP patients exhibited a reduced abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a well-known butyrate-producing bacterium belonging to Firmicutes, which, thanks to the properties of its metabolites butyrate and salicylic acid, can inhibit IL-8 production by suppressing the NF-kB pathway, upregulate Treg cell production, and induce IL-10 secretion, thus blocking the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12 and, in general, inflammatory processes [128,129]. Lower amounts of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were observed in patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease [130,131] and psoriasis [84], while Faecalibacterium prausnitzii as a probiotic supplement can be used in the prevention and management of colorectal cancer [132] and type 2 diabetes [133]. Furthermore, shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome revealed significant alterations in twelve gut microbiota pathways in BP patients, nine of which were significantly increased, i.e., those related to pyridoxal 5′-phosphate biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and biotin biosynthesis [10]. Pyridoxal 5′-phosphate acts as a cofactor of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in the conversion of L-glutamate into GABA, a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter that is also a signaling molecule produced by bacteria, fungi, plants, and invertebrates [134]. The authors identified in BP patients both the GABA shotgun, a three-step pathway that provides an alternative route for the synthesis of succinate from α-ketoglutarate in the mitochondrial-based tricarboxylic acid cycle for subsequent bacterial energy production, and the biosynthesis of putrescin, which, like ornithine and arginine, is an alternative precursor of GABA [134,135]. Putrescine, a major metabolite of gut bacteria that can promote a “leaky gut” condition during both intestinal autoinflammation and infection [136], is positively correlated with the expression of inflammatory chemokines in patients with psoriasis [137]. Additionally, putrescine, being involved in several cellular processes (proliferation, stress protection, metabolism, and regulation of the immune response), like other polyamines, if dysregulated, can impact growth, aging, and diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration [138,139]. Although the reported biological activities of GABA include alleviation of pruritus, attenuation of atopic dermatitis lesions by promoting Th1 response, increased expression of type 1 collagen, and maintenance of skin elasticity, the GABA shunt appears to play a key role in BP, consistent with the significantly positive association of GABA biosynthesis from putrescine with atopic dermatitis severity [25,30,134,140]. These inconsistent results could be attributed to differences in the components and activities of GABA shunt bacterial species even within the same genus, with some bacteria containing multiple GAD enzymes and others containing no GAD homologs at all [10,140]. Another Chinese study [39] recruiting consecutive patients diagnosed with BP, further divided into those in the active stage and in the remission stage, documented an increased trend of alpha diversity (a score referring to the species richness or evenness within a functional community [141]) in patients with BP onset compared with the control group, unlike the study of Liu et al. [10]. This finding could be explained by the enrichment of pathogenic bacteria in patients with active BP, namely Bacteroidaceae and Ruminococcaceae, and the reduced relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae compared with healthy controls [39]. Ruminococcaceae, among the most widespread families of Firmicutes, is one of the few taxa that include secondary BA producers, known to cause pro-inflammatory effects [142], although its relationship with immune-mediated diseases is somewhat controversial, with a low relative abundance associated with inflammatory bowel disease [143] and immunoglobulin E-associated eczema [144] and higher relative abundance correlated with asthma [145] and reactive arthritis [146]. Conversely, members of Lachnospiraceae, including Blautia, Coprococcus, Lachnospira, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, are massive producers of SCFAs and, as such, may alleviate inflammatory and allergic diseases by exerting anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects [147,148]. Therefore, reduced levels of Lachnospiraceae can lead to an imbalance in the functionality of the gut microbiota, resulting in an increased risk of inflammatory skin diseases such as alopecia areata [149], hidradenitis suppurativa [150], and PV [151]. Patients with active BP also showed a reduced proportion of Prevotellaceae but a higher proportion of Prevoltella copri [39]. Relative abundance of Prevotellaceae is linked to the dietary habits of rural and preagricultural or isolated populations, and if it may improve cardiovascular risk and glucose metabolism [151], it also includes strains such as Prevotella copri, a frequent inhabitant of the gut microbiota, which also shows pathobiontic properties such as releasing inflammatory mediators [152,153]. Prevotella copri is, in fact, associated with both inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis [154], human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection [155], insulin resistance [156], ankylosing spondylitis [157], and metabolic benefits by improving glycemic control [158], depending on dietary habits [159,160,161]. Active disease subjects were also characterized by a depletion of Vellonella dispar, a Gram-negative commensal bacterium that produces SCFAs by lactate fermentation [162], and Bacteroides ovatus, a commensal microbe that, due to its ability to consume a variety of food sources, colonizes the intestine, helping to prevent pathogen invasion and related inflammation [163]. Furthermore, some species shared significant correlations with clinical parameters [39]. Notably, the composition of the gut microbiota in BP patients in remission resembled that of the control group, indicating that the treatment can reduce harmful bacteria that cause inflammation, further emphasizing the involvement of intestinal microbial communities in disease development [39]. In assessing the gut microbiota profile in BP patients, Han and coauthors [164] found a higher relative abundance of pathogens and a reduction in probiotics in affected subjects, who exhibited a significant difference in beta diversity (an index describing the amount of overlap or differentiation between species communities [141]) compared with controls and an overall worse dysbiosis than that observed in PV patients. More specifically, subjects with BP presented an enrichment of Proteobacteria, although the predominance of this phylum was less evident than in PV patients, as previously observed by Scaglione et al. [38]. Furthermore, in line with the above-mentioned findings [10,39], the authors observed an increased abundance of Bacteroides and Prevotella and a reduction in Faecalibacterium, the latter being strictly and negatively correlated with autoantibody titer [164]. Functional analysis revealed significantly increased alterations in BP patients compared with PV patients in certain microbial pathways, i.e., Escherichia coli infection, shigellosis, bacterial invasion of epithelial cells, and biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a vital cell wall constituent of Gram-negative bacteria that can directly modulate the immune system by inducing cytokine production [165]), suggesting a different role of gut microbiota in bullous diseases [164].
        In summary, despite the limited number of investigations, the small sample size, and the lack of longitudinal data that generally characterize the studies analyzed, as well as the presence of only one study using shotgun metagenomic sequencing to explore gut microbiota function in BP, there are signals of association between gut microbiota dysbiosis and BP pathogenesis, with alterations in relative abundance in certain identified taxa (i.e., drop in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, increase in Prevotella copri) and metabolic routes (i.e., GABA shunt and related pathways and functional and inflammatory pathways) potentially involved in the inflammation process within the gut–skin axis. Furthermore, the different profiles of the intestinal microbiota at different stages of the disease suggest the possibility of supplementation with prebiotics, probiotics, and symbiotics to improve intestinal microbiota homeostasis, preserve the integrity of the intestinal barrier, regulate the immune response, and facilitate disease remission.
      
      
        4.2. The Association of the Gut Microbiota with Pemphigus Vulgaris
        PV is an autoimmune disease characterized primarily by the presence of IgG antibodies against Dsg1 and Dsg3 due to the involvement of immune responses mediated by B cells (crucial to producing specific autoantibodies) and T cells (participating in the onset and persistence of PV) [153,166]. In particular, Th1 and Th17 appear to play a predominant role in PV pathogenesis, with PV patients exhibiting higher levels of inflammatory Th1 (IL-1RA, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12p70, GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-18) and Th17 cytokines (IL-17, IL-22, IL-23) than healthy controls [166,167].
        In recent years, a few studies have explored the association between gut microbiota status and PV (Table 2). In an Italian pilot study aimed at evaluating potential microbial alterations in the gut, skin, and oral cavity of PV subjects, gut microbiota analysis revealed a similar composition at the phylum level to that of healthy subjects, with Firmicutes showing the highest relative abundance, followed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria [38]. Huang et al. [153] first compared gut microbiota in PV patients and healthy controls also with regard to circulating cytokines of Th1/Th2/Th17 cells. Although the two groups showed no significant differences in alpha diversity, analysis of beta diversity revealed that, at the genus level, PV patients had reduced levels of Lachnospiracea_incertae_sedis and Coprococcus, whose decline in the gut microbiota leads to reduced production of SCFAs and has been related to the development of allergies, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic disorders, and mental and neuropsychological disorders [137,153,168,169,170]. The case group was characterized by increased levels of Granulicatella and Flavonifractor, the latter not only linked to different conditions such as affective disorders and colorectal cancer but also associated with oxidative stress and increased inflammation, and whose higher relative abundance was also observed in BP patients [10,153,171,172]. Consistently, Huang and coworkers [153] found that Flavonifractor was positively correlated with circulating levels of C5a, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, and IL-21, while Lachnospiracea_incertae_sedis and Coprococcus were both negatively associated with IL-17A, indicating that changes in the gut microbiota may induce an unbalanced Th1/Th2 or Th17/Treg differentiation and related abnormal cytokine production, typical of PV. Guo et al. [173] reported that the gut microbiota of patients with PV had lower diversity and richness than those of healthy controls, and the two microbial communities showed a significant degree of dissimilarity. Indeed, although the F/B ratio was not significantly different between the two groups, the gut microbiota of PV patients presented an increased abundance of Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia and a depletion of Firmicutes, which include producers of SCFAs such as Lactobacillaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lachnospiraceae [52,173]. Consequently, the abundance of bacteria like Butyricicoccus, Clostridium, Megamonas, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and Lactobacillus murinus was significantly reduced in these subjects [173]. In contrast, pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Bacteroides fragilis, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Shigella pneumoniae were considerably enriched in patients with PV and also showed internal positive correlations, thus resulting in increased biosynthesis of LPS [173]. These opportunistic bacteria were also positively associated with anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg3 antibody levels and with the Pemphigus Disease Area Index, a validated score used to assess the severity of PV [173,174]. Additionally, metabolomic analysis on stool samples revealed abnormal accumulation of lipids and lipid compounds, especially phosphatidylethanolamine, the second most abundant class of glycerophospholipids whose metabolism dysregulation can promote inflammasome activation and contribute to the development of chronic inflammatory diseases [173,175,176]. Of note, phosphatidylethanolamine content was positively correlated with Streptococcus parasanguinis and Klebsiella pneumoniae and negatively correlated with Roseburia spp., suggesting the potential involvement of these microbial species and their metabolites in the pathogenesis and progression of PV [173]. Another case-control study documented significant differences in the composition, but not in the richness, of the gut microbiota species in PV patients compared with healthy family members [117]. In particular, the cases exhibited an enrichment of Escherichia coli, which, being a Gram-negative bacterium, is coated with LPS and therefore able to induce an inflammatory response and, by creating a “leaky gut”, to trigger the onset of autoimmune diseases [117,177]. These subjects also had a concomitant decrease in the relative abundance of probiotics and certain SCFA-producing species, which is likely attributable to the inhibitory action of Escherichia coli via the production of toxins and enterobactin (the latter a conserved siderophore that chelates iron from iron-binding host proteins, suppressing the growth of other bacteria [178]). Escherichia coli may also exacerbate inflammation and disease progression due to the lower levels of SCFAs found in PV patients, although they were partially restored after one month of glucocorticoid therapy [117]. Although glucocorticoid treatment did not significantly change alpha and beta diversity in PV patients, it caused a decrease in the relative abundance of Escherichia coli in responders, indicating that this therapy may help restore intestinal homeostasis [117]. In PV patients, Escherichia coli displayed a strong correlation with the phosphotransferase system pathway, a conserved cascade involved in the transport and phosphorylation of selected carbohydrates as well as in the virulence of several pathogenic bacterial species, suggesting that this pathway, enriched in these patients, may contribute to the toxic effects of Escherichia coli [117,179]. Confirming previous results, Li et al. [17] observed no significant differences in alpha diversity of the gut microbiota when comparing patients with pemphigus in an active stage (75% of whom had PV), patients with pemphigus in remission stage characterized by the absence of new lesions (63.7% of them had PV), and healthy controls. The authors also found no significant alterations in the composition of the microbial communities between the three groups, in line with the study by Wang et al. [117]. Conversely, the relative abundance of gut microbiota taxa in pemphigus patients was altered compared with controls [17]. Indeed, the active pemphigus group presented an enrichment of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and a depletion of Firmicutes, with a slight decrease in the F/B ratio and a significantly higher proportion of pathogenic bacteria than the pemphigus remission group, as previously reported by Guo et al. [173], supporting the involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in pemphigus development [17]. Furthermore, specific taxa were correlated with autoantibody titers. In particular, Veillonella, which has been reported to reduce the risk of asthma and bronchiolitis by inducing a mixed Th1/Th2/Th17 lung inflammatory response [180,181], was depleted among patients with active pemphigus, thus explaining the observed inverse correlation with anti-Dsg3 antibody titers [17]. In contrast, the abundance of Prevotella, which was lower in these patients than in the other groups, as observed in subjects affected by BP [39], was positively associated with anti-Dsg1 antibody titers [17]. The effects of the Prevotella genus (members of which are anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria of the Bacteroidetes phylum) on the host are still debated [166]. As discussed in Section 4.1, Prevotella strains are generally considered commensal bacteria, with increased abundance (linked to a diet rich in non-starch polysaccharides, resistant starch, and fiber content) associated with improved glucose metabolism [159,182] but in a state of dysbiosis they may cause localized infections and inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis due to the production of virulence factors (e.g., LPS, hemolysins adhesins, proteases), which enhance the proliferation and survival of microorganisms [183]. Coriobacteriaceae that, as SCFA producers, contribute to the homeostasis of intestinal microbiota, preserving the integrity of the intestinal barrier and regulating the immune system, but, when increased, affect immune reconstitution [184,185], were positively associated with anti-Dsg1 autoantibody titers [17]. Of interest, Faecalibacterium, known to exert anti-inflammatory actions through the production of butyrate [186], was also depleted in patients with autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus) [187] and positively associated with both anti-Dsg1 and anti-Dsg3 antibody titers in patients with active pemphigus [17]. Finally, research by Han et al. [164] explored differences in gut microbiota composition in different bullous diseases. Regarding PV, patients were characterized by an enrichment of Proteobacteria compared with healthy controls [164]. This is a signature of gut dysbiosis, given the generally low prevalence of this phylum within a balanced gut microbial community [188]. An increased abundance of Proteobacteria has, in fact, been associated with low-grade inflammatory conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome [189], obesity and metabolic disorders [190], and with severe intestinal inflammatory disorders including inflammatory bowel disease [191] and colorectal cancer [192]. Furthermore, consistent with Guo et al. [173], Enterobacter spp., which behaves as both facultative anaerobic Gram-negative natural commensals and opportunistic pathogens (behavior observed for Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterobacter hormaechei), were positively associated with Dsg3 autoantibodies, thus representing potential inducers of PV [148].
        Overall, although the data provided so far are limited, a fair amount of evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota of PV patients enriched in pathogenic and/or opportunistic bacteria (e.g., Flavonifractor, Enterobacter, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis) and with a lower relative abundance of probiotics (e.g., Lachnospiracea_incertae_sedis, Coprococcus, Veillonella), might be involved in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. However, the inconclusive results on associations between specific taxa and PV autoantibodies reflect the limitations of these studies, which are all based on a cross-sectional design and rely on too small numbers of subjects, and at the same time, they are often difficult to compare due to differences in sequencing methods and depths. Future multicenter research is desirable to increase statistical power together with experimental studies to confirm the role of microbial species in disease development and also to clarify all the underlying mechanisms involved in this relationship.
      
    
    
      5. The Oral Microbiota and the Relationship with the Health-Disease Status
      The oral cavity, a complex system of microbial habitats (buccal mucosa, teeth, gingival sulcus, hard and soft palate, tongue, and tonsils), hosts a multitude of bacteria, fungi, and viruses, among which bacteria represent the main components with over 700 species for a total of 150 genera and seven phyla (Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, and TM7), making this microbial community the second largest after that of the gastrointestinal tract [193,194,195]. Unlike the gut microbiota, which can profoundly modify its composition based on changes in diet and local environment, the oral microbiota remains largely stable over time with no significant differences even between individuals, except for differences in relative abundance between taxa and at the strain level [193,194].
      Growing evidence indicates that, in addition to covering a critical role in oral health by increasing the risk of oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancer, the oral microbiota is also linked to a variety of extraoral conditions, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, hepatitis, colon, esophageal, and pancreatic cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, low birth weight, Alzheimer’s disease, and Parkinson’s disease [37,193,194,196]. In fact, despite the still limited data, it has become clear that oral health, which can be profoundly affected by poor oral hygiene behaviors, can impact human health through an inflammatory response caused by a localized infection like gingivitis and mucosal inflammation or, alternatively, by the ectopic invasion of oral microorganisms (e.g., Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis) into other organs [37,195,197]. Dysbiosis in the oral cavity creates an inflammatory microenvironment containing elevated levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-2 IL-8, TNF-α, and prostaglandins), which can be released into the circulatory system and contribute to systemic inflammation [197].
      Among chronic inflammatory cutaneous diseases, psoriasis is strongly associated with periodontal disease. In fact, psoriatic patients suffer from worse periodontal health (more severe gingival inflammation, alveolar bone loss, and fewer remaining teeth) compared with subjects without psoriasis [197,198]. A recent study also found that subjects with alterations in the oral microflora, i.e., reduced levels of Prevotella and higher relative abundance of Corynebacterium, are more likely to experience a psoriasis exacerbation, suggesting a direct contribution of the oral microbiota, rather than the severity of gingivitis, to the disease pathogenesis [196].
      
        The Association of the Oral Microbiota with Pemphigus Vulgaris
        While the association between the oral microbiota and BP remains unexplored to date, two investigations have explored the oral microbiota profile in PV patients (Table 3). The first, which evaluated the composition of the microbiota in three different districts of patients affected by PV, highlighted how their oral mucosa was characterized by the greatest diversity, with Firmicutes as the most abundant phylum, followed, in decreasing proportions, by Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria [38]. Comparison with a selected reference control group revealed a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the oral mucosa of PV patients, which could explain the typical intraoral halitosis resulting from the decomposition of sulfur-containing amino acids by anaerobic bacteria observed in these subjects [38,199]. The second study, aimed at assessing the composition of the oral microbiota in PV patients with oral lesions and healthy individuals, found a total of nine phyla in all cases and controls, and Firmicutes was confirmed as the most represented phylum in both groups, followed by Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria, although with a significant dominance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria in patients compared with healthy controls [200]. Despite the lack of substantial differences in the alpha diversity index, the significantly increased number of genera observed in patients might depend on insufficient oral hygiene due to the presence of painful lesions, which represent one of the early manifestations in 50% of PV subjects before manifesting as skin blisters [200,201]. On the other hand, the beta diversity analysis revealed a higher abundance of Parvimonas micra and Fusobacterium nucleatum in patients compared with controls [200]. Parvimonas micra, a gram-positive obligate anaerobe and a common constituent of the commensal flora in the gastrointestinal tract, has been identified as a major oral pathogen associated with endoperiodontal lesions and periodontitis, as well as among the most common species contributing to a variety of infections, systemic abscesses, and some malignancies [202,203,204,205]. Fusobacterium nucleatum, a gram-negative anaerobic opportunistic pathogen that promotes colonization and adherence to oral biofilms by almost all bacterial species, thus participating in the production of volatile sulfur compounds, and oral plaque formation, is also crucially involved in the development of periodontitis, extraoral infections and abscesses, colorectal cancer, and, with less evidence, oral squamous cell carcinoma [206,207,208,209]. The dominance of these two species, along with the depletion of Streptococcus salivarius, which appears to inhibit the growth of periodontal pathogens contributing to the balance of the oral microbiota, may explain the unpleasant odor of PV subjects [200,210].
        While collectively, oral microbiota composition does not appear to be associated with PV, which also raises the question of whether dysbiosis status in the oral cavity is the cause or consequence of autoimmune bullous diseases, the higher relative abundance of oral Firmicutes in these patients suggests a possible role of this phylum in the PV pathogenesis. At the same time, the substantial reduction of Bacteroidetes and the abundance of anaerobic species associated with inflammatory diseases, including periodontitis, can account for the distinct malodor typical of PV patients.
      
    
    
      6. The Skin Microbiota and the Relationship with the Health–Disease Status
      Human skin, with a surface of approximately 1.8 m2, is the largest and the most exposed organ of the body, serving both as a physical barrier against foreign pathogens and as a niche capable of providing a milieu for a myriad of commensals, with a total of 1 million resident bacteria per cm2 [211,212]. Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes are the four dominant bacterial phyla in the skin, with variations in microbial composition dictated by topography, whereby different regions characterized by specific pH, temperature, moisture, and sebum content influence microbial community structures [213,214]. Like the gut microbiota, the skin microflora represents a dynamic system, subject to two significant changes, the first one occurring after birth and the latter happening at the adolescence stage when sexual maturation promotes the proliferation of lipophilic bacteria, while other small changes are due to alterations in host biology and environmental exposures (skin care products, antibiotics) throughout life [211].
      Despite the recent interest in the skin microbiota, it has been established to play a key role in maintaining healthy skin conditions through modulation of the immune system, inhibition of pathogenic bacteria growth, synthesis of vitamins and amino acids, and regulation of epidermal differentiation [211,214]. Epidermal keratinocytes produce AMPs (mostly represented by peptides such as β-defensin 2 and cathelicidin) that can be constitutively expressed or, alternatively, regulated by the complement C5a receptor, which also modulates the expression of pattern recognition receptors, proinflammatory mediators, and possibly the skin microbiota [215]. On the other hand, a disequilibrium in the composition of the microbial community, leading to epithelial barrier breakdown, increased pathogens colonization concomitant with depletion of beneficial commensals, and ultimately immune dysregulation and inflammatory response, has been associated with the onset of antigen-driven disorders including acne vulgaris (imbalance between the status of Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis [216]); psoriasis (increased proportions of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and reduction of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Propionibacterium and Staphylococcus epidermidis [85,217,218]); atopic dermatitis (overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus [219]); and rosacea (higher relative abundance of Staphylococcus, Cutibacterium, Pseudomonas, Corynebacterium, Acinetobacter, Snodgrasella, Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii, Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis [220,221,222]). Nonetheless, it is currently unclear whether inflammatory skin diseases are the result of disturbances in the skin microbiota or whether they themselves promote this change [214,223]. Importantly, in immunosuppressed hosts, certain species such as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Malassezia, Cutibacterium acne, and Roseomonas mucosa can cause systemic diseases when they penetrate deeper tissue, giving rise to bacteremia, chronic wounds, osteomyelitis, and/or surgical site soft tissue infections [224].
      
        The Association of the Skin Microbiota with Bullous Pemphigoid and Pemphigus Vulgaris
        So far, the relationship between skin microbial communities and autoimmune blistering diseases has been investigated in three studies (Table 4). In the first, a comparison of the skin microbiota in BP patients and matched controls across multiple sites documented no significant differences in the alpha diversity, in agreement with most studies evaluating this index for the gut and oral microbiota (see previous sections) [5]. Conversely, beta diversity significantly differed between patients and controls in perilesional sites (areas adjacent to a fresh blister of erosion) as well as between perilesional and non-lesional sites (contralateral to the perilesional site) within patients, indicating that this parameter changed depending on the disease status and the associated cutaneous microbiota [5]. Perilesional sites in BP patients had a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and Staphylococcus [5], which, in Staphylococcus aureus, is associated with atopic dermatitis that, like BP, shares various characteristics, including itch, increased levels of eosinophils, and elevated amounts of IgG autoantibodies [6,225,226,227,228]. Scaglione et al. [38] recruited patients with PV or BP and assessed the composition of the skin lesion microbiota, finding that Firmicutes was the most represented phylum in both patient groups, while the genus Staphylococcus was confirmed as the most abundant in the two groups. In contrast to the study by Miodovnik et al. [5], who reported a higher relative abundance of Staphylococcus epidermis, an opportunistic pathogen in the context of immunosuppression, the authors identified Staphylococcus aureus as the most abundant species in BP patients [38], consistent with previous data [229,230]. In addition to being implicated in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis and other minor skin infections such as folliculitis and impetigo, Staphylococcus aureus, a commensal species that is a major component of the skin microbiota, has also been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus with renal and skin involvement [231] and is the leading etiologic agent of osteomyelitis [232], septic arthritis [233], and sepsis [234]. Furthermore, Staphylococcus aureus can colonize chronic wounds typical of the genetic blistering disease epidermolysis bullosa [235]. Notably, in line with Miodovnik et al. [5], who identified Proteobacteria as the most abundant phylum in non-lesional sites of BP patients and healthy subjects, Scaglione and coauthors found a prevalence of Proteobacteria >5% in only one patient, supporting the low pathogenicity of this phylum [38]. In a recent multicenter study [236], substantial differences in the skin microbiota were detected between BP patients and age- and sex-matched controls, with a significant reduction in the alpha diversity in both perilesional and contralateral sites of patients, as also reported for epidermolysis bullosa acquisita [237], psoriasis [238], and atopic dermatitis [239]. The authors observed an inverse correlation of disease status with Cutibacterium acnes, one of the most abundant bacteria in the skin microbiota, which, although acting as an opportunistic pathogen leading to various inflammatory conditions both in the skin and many other internal organs, is generally considered a commensal species implicated in maintaining skin health through the production of SCFAs, which can limit pathogen colonization [236,240,241,242]. The relative abundance of Staphylococcus aureus was increased in both perilesional and contralateral lesions and in sites rarely affected by BP, consistent with the higher prevalence of this species in the nares and on the surface of unaffected skin of BP patients compared with matched controls observed by Messingham and coauthors [230] and the significant positive correlation with disease severity [236]. Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus hominis also exhibited significantly negative correlations in perilesional and contralateral sites of patients but not in any matched controls, suggesting that Staphylococcus aureus is an important biomarker of BP, although it remains unclear whether PV patients were colonized by this species before developing the disease [215,221].
        Overall, these findings indicate that the skin microbiota may play a key role in BP, although published cross-sectional studies do not allow us to exclude the observed differences in the composition of microbial communities (i.e., a higher relative abundance of Firmicutes in affected subjects) derive from the disease. In particular, the skin pathogen Staphylococcus aureus appears as a pivotal indicator of BP and is associated with the severity status of the disease, suggesting that modulation of the skin microbiota, even with early antibiotic treatment, could represent an effective therapeutic strategy for BP.
      
    
    
      7. Conclusions and Future Challenges
      In recent years, the role of microbiota, particularly in the human gut, has been increasingly investigated in both healthy subjects and diseases. Perturbations in the balance of microbial communities have been associated with a higher risk of developing a variety of pathological conditions through the production of metabolites that, acting as antigens, can stimulate intestinal epithelial cells, cause damage to the intestinal barrier, and trigger autoimmune responses and subsequent inflammation. BP and PV are the most common chronic autoimmune bullous diseases, and despite distinct physiopathology and clinical signs, their etiology, at least partly unknown, has been linked to an enrichment of pathogenic bacteria and a generally higher relative abundance of Firmicutes and to a depletion of probiotics/beneficial species, along with specific associations between certain bacterial taxa and disease autoantibodies and the involvement of microbial function alterations. Data gathered so far are suggestive of a potentially relevant role of changes in the microbiota composition and diversity in the development and progression of BP and PV, although with different levels of evidence depending on the body district (Table 5) composition.
      While the relationship between the alpha and beta diversity indices in the skin and oral cavity and the prevalence of the two diseases is still poorly explored, growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota alterations in the beta diversity may contribute to BP risk, with certain microorganisms and pathways directly involved in the link between gut dysbiosis and disease activity. In contrast, the role of the gut microbiota in the etiopathogenesis of PV remains controversial, as only a few studies documented significant variations in the composition and diversity of microbial communities between patients and healthy controls. Overall, published studies are based on a cross-sectional design and a limited number of subjects, given the rarity of BP and PV. Additionally, most of the research was conducted in Asian countries, which represents a potential bias in the result interpretation due to the possible influence of lifestyle and dietary habits on the composition of the microbiota. Heterogeneity between studies owing to different sequencing methods (e.g., 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomic analysis, and metabolome sequencing), populations, diet, age-related alterations in the gut microbiota, disease severity, presence of comorbidities, and pharmacological treatments makes comparison of results difficult and needs further validation in future studies. Multicenter studies enrolling a large number of subjects and possibly performed in different geographical areas are therefore warranted to verify the current data and the possibility of a causal relationship, also through the analysis of microbe-microbe interactions to determine which microorganisms and/or strains can be unequivocally associated with BP and PV development and which instead can be beneficial for their management, together with experimental studies aimed at identifying plausible biological mechanisms.
      The knowledge gained so far, and future data will help to shed light on both a complete picture of the development and diagnostics of BP and PV, also by detecting bacterial markers and possible alternative treatment strategies for these two conditions. In particular, modulation of the intestinal microbiota by oral prebiotics (a group of nutrients, namely plant fiber, used to feed the gut commensals) and probiotics (live strains of selected microorganisms, mainly of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera, which, if administered in adequate amounts, confer a healthy balance to the host’s gut) have immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic effects, thus acting as therapeutic agents [27]. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), aimed at restoring the homeostasis conditions of the microbiota habitat and normal SCFA synthesis, has been successfully applied in the treatment of numerous disorders, such as Crohn’s disease, hepatic encephalitis, metabolic diseases, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and allergic and autoimmune diseases, and could therefore represent an additional treatment option in bullous diseases, also in light of the ongoing study of new methods to minimize the side effects of FMT and replenish only species with selected characteristics [27]. At the same time, the development of bacteriotherapy, which is based on the topical application of prebiotics and probiotics, the latter already in use to combat skin aging, could improve skin health by promoting the growth of beneficial species (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermis), eliminating pathogens (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus), and enhancing the skin’s natural defense barrier [211,212,214]. Therefore, the collected findings, in addition to providing new insights into the pathogenesis of bullous diseases, pave the way for the beginning of a novel era in their treatment through a holistic approach, including the use of multiple methods, such as FMT, oral and topical pre- and probiotics, and, possibly, the use of antibiotics against oral opportunistic infections occurring in PV as adjuvants to traditional therapies.

Title: A Recalcitrant Case of Hidradenitis Suppurativa: Successful Combination of Biologic, Antibiotic, and Surgical Therapy

Abstract: AbstractIntroductionHidradenitis suppurativa (HS), or acne inversa, is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that leads to painful nodules, abscesses, and fistulas.Case PresentationThis case describes the treatment of a 49-year-old male patient with progressive and massively inflamed HS for 20 years who also suffered from heart failure (NYHA II–III, EF 35–40%) and hypochromic microcytic anaemia (Hb 7.8 g/dL). Upon presentation, he was suffering from fatigue and severe pain (8–9/10, NRS). Due to prolonged immobility, knee and hip joint contractures with extension deficits were present. At the initial presentation, communicating, and purulent sinus tracts were observed bilaterally from the gluteal to femoral region and perianal area. Hurley score III, HS-PGA score: very severe, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score: 19, ISH4 score: severe (16). Under adalimumab s.c. 40 mg/week combined with clindamycin (300 mg bd), the condition had worsened. The patient was admitted to the hospital for i.v. administration of ertapenem 1 g/day for 14 days in preparation for sinus tract resection. With an Hb level of 7.8 g/dL, the patient received iron carboxymaltose and erythropoietin. After a significant reduction in inflammatory markers (leukocytes 17.11/nL to 7.42/nL), a large excision of the sinus tracts was performed bilaterally in the gluteal region and left femoral area. Following 4 weeks of wound granulation, split-thickness skin grafting was performed. The knee and hip joint contractures improved with intensive physiotherapy. After surgery, the patient received antibiotic therapy with clindamycin, rifampicin, and metronidazole (clindamycin 600 mg, rifampicin 300 mg, metronidazole 500 mg, each p.o. 2×/day). In parallel, anti-inflammatory therapy with secukinumab 300 mg s.c. twice a month was initiated. Over the following 3 months, no progression or recurrence occurred. Quality of life and pain levels improved significantly under the therapy (DLQI from 19 to 10, pain from 8 to 9 to 3/10 NRS).ConclusionIn extensive cases of HS, a combination of surgical and conservative therapy is necessary. We demonstrate that severe cases can be successfully treated with a combination of antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and surgical therapy.

Body: Introduction
      Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the apocrine glands, mainly affecting axillae, inguinal, and perianal areas. Patients suffer from recurrent inflammatory episodes, leading to the formation of painful nodules, abscesses, sinus tracts, and scars. The disease has a severe impact on the quality of life due to psychosocial distress, pain and mobility restrictions [1, 2].
      This case report shows a male patient battling a severe form of HS for over 20 years with underlying comorbidities. A combination of biologic, antibiotic, and surgical therapy was necessary to treat this recalcitrant case of HS. The aim of this report was to highlight the necessity of a combination of systemic and surgical treatment for advanced HS.
    
    
      Case Report
      In January 2024, a 49-year-old male presented with a 20-year-long history of HS. Over multiple years, his condition had worsened. Upon presentation, he showed extensive fistulas and abscesses in the gluteal, femoral, and perianal regions with emphasis of the left side (Fig. 1a). There were extensive scars in both axillae after previous surgery and sinus tracts in atypical regions: on his abdomen, chest, on his lower right leg and behind both ears. His most recent treatment included 8 months of adalimumab 40 mg s.c. weekly and 3 months of oral clindamycin 300 mg bd and resulted in a further deterioration of his clinical status. Also, his comorbidities including heart failure (NYHA II-III, ejection fraction 35–40%) and hypochromic microcytic anaemia (haemoglobin 7.8 g/dL) had not been addressed yet.

      The long-lasting inflammation of the skin had caused limited mobility with a restriction of movement of the left hip and contracture of the left knee: both joints could not be extended fully anymore. Moreover, he suffered from extreme fatigue and significant pain (NRS 8–9/10). His Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score showed a significant deterioration with a result of 19. In total, he presented himself with a case of Hurley stage III HS, an HS-PGA score of very severe disease and an International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System (IHS4) score of 16.
      The patient showed extensive bilateral gluteal and femoral sinus tracts, with a particularly large sinus tract measuring 40 cm in diameter on his left buttocks. All fistulas were actively purulent and malodorous. His blood work showed elevated inflammatory markers, with leukocytes at 17.11/nL. Considering the failure of past systemic therapies, we implemented a new strategy focused on control of the inflammation, and surgical excision of the permanently damaged tissue.
      After hospitalization, we started an intravenous treatment with ertapenem 1 g daily for 14 days to downregulate the inflammation (Fig. 1a–c). Parallelly, the patient received iron carboxymaltose (500 mg FerApplic i.v.) and erythropoietin (20,000 IU s.c.) to treat his anaemia. After a few days, the clinical signs of inflammation improved and the patient’s inflammatory blood markers had decreased significantly, with leukocytes dropping to 7.42/nL.
      After addressing the overall inflammation and the comorbidities, the patient underwent extensive excision of the sinus tracts and scar tissue of the gluteal region and the left femoral area. The surgery was performed under general anaesthesia in combination with tumescence anaesthesia. Subsequently, the wounds were rinsed daily, and calcium alginate was applied in order to advance secondary intention healing until the granulation tissue was sufficient to be covered by a skin graft (Fig. 2a–c).

      Transfusion of two units of red blood cells, as well as infusion of iron carboxymaltose (500 mg FerApplic i.v.) and erythropoietin (20,000 IU s.c.), was necessary postoperatively in order to treat the coexisting anaemia. Four weeks after the excision of sinus tracts, we performed a split skin graft transplantation. The patients’ immobility caused by knee contractures was improved by daily physiotherapy.
      Following intravenous antibiotic treatment with ertapenem, we applied a combination of oral clindamycin 600 mg, rifampicin 300 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg, twice daily for 4 weeks to prevent the recurrence of inflammation. Within 3 months, the patient showed a significant improvement in pain levels (8–9/10 to 3/10) and in quality of life (DLQI score improved from 19 to 10). Furthermore, the surgical wounds healed successfully. Further surgical treatment was necessary for the atypically located sinus tracts (retroauricular, lower leg, chest). One year after surgery, there were no signs of further progression or recurrence of the disease.
    
    
      Discussion
      Severe cases of HS pose a significant treatment challenge for dermatologists. The goal of this case report was to highlight several important aspects of handling such complex cases.
      Management in this case relied on a multimodal approach, addressing both the inflammation and the irreparable tissue damage following a long-lasting and insufficiently treated course of the disease. The recently published version of the European HS guidelines differentiates between inflammatory cases of HS and non-inflammatory cases: the first should be treated with medical therapy while the latter requires a surgical approach [3]. In cases with both inflammation and irreparable tissue damage, a combination treatment is necessary.
      In our patient’s case, a key part of the therapeutic strategy was the combination of antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, and surgical interventions, each targeting a distinct aspect of the disease pathophysiology. Intravenous ertapenem, a broad-spectrum carbapenem, was administered to reduce the bacterial load typical of HS lesions, particularly anaerobic and gram-negative organisms. This allowed for better local control of infection before surgical excision. Postoperatively, oral clindamycin and rifampicin were continued due to their synergistic effect in targeting biofilm-associated bacteria. Metronidazole was added to enhance anaerobic coverage and support anti-inflammatory effects.
      In parallel, secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-17, was initiated to suppress the chronic inflammatory pathway central to HS. IL-17 is a key cytokine driving neutrophilic inflammation and tissue destruction in HS. Blocking IL-17 helps reduce inflammatory cell recruitment and contributes to long-term disease control [4, 5].
      Additionally, erythropoietin and intravenous iron carboxymaltose were administered to treat anaemia, which likely impaired wound healing and contributed to fatigue. Finally, radical surgical excision of the sinus tracts removed the chronically inflamed and irreparably damaged tissue and created a foundation for subsequent wound granulation and successful grafting. Healing by secondary intention ensured that residual infection could be adequately managed before definitive closure [3, 6, 7].
      The IL-17 inhibitor secukinumab played a significant role in maintaining the patient’s remission post-surgery. Choosing an appropriate systemic therapy is a crucial factor in achieving and sustaining long-term disease control in patients with refractory HS [8, 9].
    
    
      Conclusion
      HS is a complex chronic inflammatory skin condition that requires an individualized and often multimodal treatment approach. Therapeutic options include topical and systemic antibiotics, hormonal therapy, retinoids, immunosuppressive agents, and biologics such as TNF-α or IL-17 inhibitors. In advanced stages with irreparable tissue damage, surgical intervention becomes necessary to achieve long-term control.
      This case demonstrates that a combination of antibiotic therapy, surgical excision, and anti-inflammatory treatment with IL-17 blockade can successfully induce remission in severe HS. Importantly, biologics such as secukinumab offer a promising long-term treatment option, especially in patients with refractory disease. Their role has become increasingly relevant in the broader therapeutic landscape, as highlighted by recent literature discussing patient management in complex situations, including during COVID-19 vaccination campaigns [6].
      Dermatologists should consider a stepwise, patient-centred strategy that combines available therapies according to disease severity, prior response to treatments, and patient comorbidities [1, 9]. Further research is needed to optimize the sequencing and combination of these therapies to improve long-term outcomes in HS patients.

Title: Epidemiology of Skin Diseases in Poland: Analysis of Prevalence and Risk Factors: A Cross-Sectional Study

Abstract: IntroductionAlthough skin diseases are a significant public health concern, epidemiological data for Poland is still lacking. This study aimed to fill this scientific gap by analyzing the prevalence of skin diseases and associated risk factors in the Polish population.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the National Healthy Skin Test (2023), an online questionnaire distributed via the Medonet health platform, involving 27,000 adult Polish internet users. Participants self-reported physician-diagnosed skin conditions. The prevalence of these conditions was assessed, and statistical analysis, including logistic regression, was used to evaluate associations with demographic and socioeconomic factors (age, gender, education level, and urbanization).ResultsThe most prevalent skin conditions were herpes labialis (40.6%), dandruff (37.6%), hair loss (34.8%), and acne (32.7%), with 89.5% of participants reporting at least one condition. Striking gender differences were observed, with psoriasis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.10, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.80–2.30) and tinea pedis (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.90–2.30) in men, while women were more prone to rosacea (OR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.50–0.70) and hair loss (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.60–0.70). Higher education was unexpectedly associated with an increased risk of multiple conditions, including acne (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.40–1.60) and non-melanoma skin cancer (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.20–1.80), but a decreased risk of psoriasis (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00). Urban residents of cities with > 500,000 inhabitants showed a significantly higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis/eczema (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00–1.30) and non-melanoma skin cancer (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.40–2.90) compared with other areas.ConclusionsThis first overview of skin disease epidemiology in Poland reveals significant variations in prevalence based on demographic and socioeconomic factors. These findings have important public health implications, suggesting the need for: (1) gender-specific dermatological education campaigns, (2) age-targeted skin cancer screening programs for those over 65 years, (3) improved access to dermatological care in rural areas, and (4) educational interventions addressing the observed socioeconomic disparities in disease prevalence and detection.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13555-025-01464-5.

Body: Key Summary Points
      
Why carry out this study?Skin diseases pose a significant public health concern in Poland, but national epidemiological data, particularly on a wide range of conditions and their specific sociodemographic correlates, have been limited.Understanding Poland-specific skin disease prevalence and associated risk factors is crucial for tailoring national public health strategies, allocating healthcare resources, and identifying vulnerable populations.This study aimed to determine the self-reported lifetime prevalence of 20 common skin conditions and their associations with key demographic (age, gender) and socioeconomic (education, urbanization) factors in a large sample of adult Polish internet users.What was learned from this study?Among 27,000 adult Polish internet users, 89.5% reported at least one physician-diagnosed skin condition: the most prevalent were herpes labialis (40.6%), dandruff (37.6%), hair loss (34.8%), and acne (32.7%). Significant variations by gender, age, education, and urbanization were identified.Adjusted analyses revealed important risk associations: for instance, men had higher odds of psoriasis (rdds ratio [OR] = 2.00) and tinea pedis (OR = 2.00), while higher education was unexpectedly associated with increased odds of acne (OR = 1.50) and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC; OR = 1.40), but decreased odds of psoriasis (OR = 0.90). Residents of large cities (> 500,000) had higher odds of atopic dermatitis/eczema (OR = 1.20) and NMSC (OR = 2.00).The study provides valuable initial insights into the dermatological landscape within a large sample of Polish internet users, highlighting a substantial self-perceived burden and distinct demographic/socioeconomic patterns that can inform hypotheses for future population-representative research and suggest potential areas for targeted public health awareness.The findings, particularly the high prevalence and specific risk associations (e.g., gender differences, links with education and urbanization), underscore the potential need for tailored dermatological education, screening programs (like for NMSC in older urban populations), and strategies to address care access disparities, pending confirmation in broader, representative Polish population samples.
    
    
      Introduction
      Skin diseases represent a significant burden on healthcare systems, both due to their relatively high prevalence and the impact on the quality of life of those affected [1, 2]. This diverse group of conditions includes both chronic and acute diseases, ranging from very common to extremely rare. Although largely non-fatal, skin diseases contribute to a deterioration in patients’ functioning, posing physical, mental, and financial burdens. Numerous studies have demonstrated that dermatological conditions such as atopic dermatitis [3], psoriasis [4], and acne [5] significantly impair various aspects of patients’ quality of life, particularly in psychological and social domains [6, 7].
      Among oncological conditions, skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the USA, posing a notable challenge to public health [8]. Its more prevalent form, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), is characterized by slow growth and a low tendency to metastasize. In contrast, melanoma, though rarer, is more malignant and has higher mortality rates. In both cases, early detection is crucial for prognosis, underscoring the importance of understanding the epidemiology of these cancers.
      Skin diseases place a considerable strain on primary healthcare resources, being a common reason for consultations with general practitioners [9, 10]. In Poland, visits to dermatology clinics accounted for 5.6% of all outpatient visits in the public health sector in 2022, ranking them sixth among all specialty clinics [11].
      There are numerous studies in scientific literature addressing the epidemiology of skin diseases worldwide. Among the most significant is the comprehensive “global skin disease morbidity and mortality: an update from the Global Burden of Disease Study”, which summarizes data from over 4000 sources and ranks skin diseases as the fourth leading cause of nonfatal disease burden [2]. More recently, a large-scale population-based study in 2022 examined the prevalence of common skin diseases across 27 European countries, including Poland, highlighting their widespread occurrence [1]. However, while such multinational studies provide valuable overarching insights, detailed national-level data, particularly concerning a range of conditions and their specific sociodemographic risk factors within Poland, are still lacking. Country-specific epidemiological features can be influenced by unique demographic profiles, genetic predispositions, environmental exposures, lifestyle factors, and variations in healthcare system access and reporting, which may not be fully captured in broader European analyses. Furthermore, understanding the nuances of skin disease prevalence and its correlates within the Polish population is crucial for tailoring national public health strategies, allocating healthcare resources effectively, and identifying specific vulnerable groups. Thus, there is an unmet need for a dedicated epidemiological investigation of skin diseases in Poland.
      Therefore, this study aimed to determine the self-reported lifetime prevalence of a range of 20 common skin conditions within a large sample of the adult Polish internet-using population. A further primary objective was to identify and quantify the associations between the occurrence of these skin conditions and key demographic factors, namely age and gender, as well as socioeconomic factors, including education level and degree of urbanization. We hypothesized that prevalence would vary significantly across these different demographic and socioeconomic subgroups, potentially highlighting areas for targeted public health interventions. Ultimately, the findings are intended to contribute to a better understanding of the dermatological burden in Poland and inform healthcare resource management.
    
    
      Methods
      
        Study Design and Setting
        A national cross-sectional study design was employed to investigate the prevalence of skin diseases and associated risk factors in Poland. Data were collected as part of the “National Healthy Skin Test,” an online survey conducted in Poland throughout 2023. The questionnaire was administered electronically via Medonet (Ringier Axel Springer Poland), a major Polish health-oriented internet portal with a broad user base.
      
      
        Study Population and Recruitment
        Participants were adult (≥ 18 years) Polish internet users who voluntarily accessed and completed the online questionnaire on the Medonet platform. No specific exclusion criteria were applied beyond the age requirement and the necessity of internet access to participate. The recruitment strategy employed a convenience sampling method. Potential participants were primarily invited through prominent banner advertisements and direct links featured on the Onet.pl homepage. Similar access was provided via banner advertisements and a dedicated landing page for the “National Healthy Skin Test” on the Medonet.pl homepage. Furthermore, links directing to the survey were embedded within relevant health-focused articles published on the Medonet.pl portal. It is important to note that email invitations were not used as a recruitment channel for this study.
        An initial total of 30,417 questionnaires were collected. Subsequently, these responses underwent data quality validation and cleaning procedures, which were conducted by a professional research agency specializing in market and social research. This process resulted in a final analytical sample of 27,000 valid responses. The validation and cleaning procedures involved thorough checks for the completeness of key variables, the identification and removal of likely duplicate entries on the basis of response patterns and submission timestamps, and the exclusion of responses that were overtly inconsistent or contained nonsensical answers. In adherence to data privacy considerations regarding sensitive health information, IP addresses were not collected or utilized in any part of the deduplication process.
      
      
        Data Collection and Variables
        Data were collected using a self-administered online questionnaire developed in Polish (an English translation of the relevant questions is provided in Supplementary Table S1).
        Outcome variables (skin conditions):: The primary outcomes were the self-reported lifetime prevalence of various skin conditions. Participants were asked: “Have you ever been diagnosed by a physician with any of the following dermatological conditions affecting the skin, hair, or nails?” This question was followed by a list of 22 specific conditions or categories from which participants could make multiple selections (see Supplementary Table S1). These questionnaire items were: acne, androgenic hair loss, atopic dermatitis, dandruff, eczema, fungal skin infection, furuncle, hair loss (cause unknown/not androgenic), herpes labialis, melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), pemphigus/pemphigoid, psoriasis, rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, tinea pedis, tinea unguium, viral warts, vitiligo, other bacterial or viral skin infection, other hair or nail disease, and other skin disease. These items were selected on the basis of their reported clinical prevalence in dermatological practice and their public health significance in Poland, aiming for an overview of common dermatological issues.
        For the purpose of analysis and reporting, two pairs of these questionnaire items were combined owing to their clinical similarity and common interchangeable use in lay and sometimes clinical contexts, resulting in 20 final condition categories: (1) “atopic dermatitis” and “eczema” were combined into a single category: “atopic dermatitis/eczema,” and (2) “androgenic hair loss” and “hair loss (cause unknown/not androgenic)” were combined into a general category: “hair loss.” The remaining 18 items were analyzed as distinct categories.
        Regarding specific terms used in the questionnaire: “non-melanoma skin cancer” was presented as such, and participant understanding relied on their recall of a prior physician diagnosis. “Dandruff” was included owing to its common self-recognition and high reported frequency in the population, acknowledging that this lay term may encompass mild forms of seborrheic dermatitis or other pityriasiform scalp conditions. The categories “other hair or nail disease” and “other skin disease” were provided to allow for the reporting of any diagnosed conditions not explicitly listed. The reliance on self-reported physician diagnoses for ascertaining skin conditions is a methodological aspect whose implications are further addressed in the limitations section of this paper.
        Exposure variables (demographic and socioeconomic factors): Participants also provided information on several demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Age was reported directly by participants and subsequently categorized for analysis into the following groups: 18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, and 65+ years. Gender was self-reported with options for “male,” “female,” or “other.” Educational level was categorized on the basis of the Polish education system as “primary and vocational,” “secondary and post-secondary,” or “higher education.” The place of residence, used as a proxy for the degree of urbanization, was categorized on the basis of population size as follows: “countryside,” “city up to 19,000 citizens,” “city of 20,000–49,000 citizens,” “city of 50,000–99,000 citizens,” “city of 100,000–199,000 citizens,” “city of 200,000–499,000 citizens,” and “city of 500,000 and more citizens.”
      
      
        Study Size Justification
        To estimate an appropriate minimum sample size for determining prevalence with reasonable precision, standard calculations were performed. Assuming a 95% confidence interval (CI) (corresponding to a Z-value of 1.96), a margin of error (E) of ± 3% (0.03), and, to maximize sample size requirements in the absence of prior Polish estimates for all conditions, an anticipated population proportion (p) of skin conditions of 50% (0.5), the formula n = Z2p(1 − p)/E2 indicated a minimum requirement of n = 1068 individuals. The achieved final sample size of n = 27,000 participants considerably exceeds this minimum, thereby providing robust statistical power for the planned descriptive and analytical components of the study.
      
      
        Ethical Approval and Consent to Participate
        This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1964 and its later amendments). The research protocol for this survey-based study, which involved the collection of anonymized data and voluntary participation, was reviewed by the Bioethics Committee of the Military Chamber of Physicians (Wojskowa Izba Lekarska) in Warsaw, Poland. The committee determined that formal ethical approval was not required for this type of study, given its anonymized and voluntary nature (decision no. KB 65/2024).
        All participants were adult (≥ 18 years) internet users. Prior to commencing the online questionnaire, all individuals were fully informed about the study’s objectives, the nature of the data to be collected, and data handling procedures. Participation was entirely voluntary and anonymous, and no compensation was offered. Online informed consent to participate was obtained from all participants before they could proceed with the survey. As all data were collected and analyzed anonymously, specific consent to publish individual data was not applicable as no identifiable information is included in this paper.
      
      
        Statistical Analyses
        All statistical analyses were performed using Statistica 13.5 (1984–2017 TIBCO Software Inc, Palo Alto, California, USA) and MS Excel software. A p-value of ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all tests.
        Descriptive statistics, including frequencies (n) and percentages (%), were used to summarize the demographic characteristics of the study sample and the prevalence of each skin condition. To assess differences in the prevalence of skin diseases on the basis of gender, age category, education level, and urbanization category, bivariate chi-squared tests (test of independence) were utilized. For direct comparisons of skin disease occurrence by gender, odds ratios (OR) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated, using females as the reference group.
        To further investigate associations and control for potential confounding, multivariable logistic regression models were implemented separately for each skin disease as the dependent variable (coded as 0 for absence and 1 for presence of the self-reported diagnosed condition). The independent variables (predictors) included in these models were gender (reference: female), age category (reference: 45–54 years), education level (reference: secondary and post-secondary education), and degree of urbanization (reference: city of 50,000–99,000 inhabitants). These reference categories were chosen as they generally represented common or substantial segments within our sample. For each model, odds ratios (OR) and their 95% CIs were calculated for each category of the independent variables relative to these reference levels. Regression coefficients (β) and their statistical significance were also determined for each predictor.
        The final analyses were conducted on participants with complete data for the variables included in each specific model. Participants with missing data for any variable included in a specific logistic regression model were excluded from that particular analysis.
        In addition to the main analyses, gender-stratified analyses were performed to explore the prevalence of skin conditions by age, education, and urbanization separately for males and females. Given the non-probabilistic, convenience sampling method inherent in this online voluntary survey, statistical inferences regarding the broader Polish population are made with caution, a point elaborated upon in the Discussion. No specific sensitivity analyses beyond the stratified analyses were pre-planned or conducted for this study.

        Regarding place of residence, 5487 participants (20.3%) lived in rural areas, and 5563 (20.6%) resided in large cities with over 500,000 inhabitants. Cities with populations between 20,000 and 49,000 inhabitants were home to 4137 participants (15.3%). The distribution across other urbanization categories is detailed in Table 1.
      
      
        Prevalence of Skin Diseases
        A significant portion of respondents (89.5%) reported at least one of the listed diseases, with a similar prevalence among women and men. Age-related differences were observed: individuals aged 18–44 showed a statistically significant excess of those reporting at least one disease. Educational attainment and place of residence also influenced reporting patterns. Higher education was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting at least one disease compared with those with lower, vocational, or secondary education. Moreover, residents of cities with populations exceeding 200,000 exhibited a statistically significant excess of individuals reporting at least one skin disease. Table 2 shows the percentage structure of participants who declared at least one disease.Table 2Percentage structure of participants who declared any disease [the numbers (n) and frequencies (%) of the occurrences of skin diseases among study sample; total: 27,000)Disease occurrenceYesNoDifference significanceTotal24,161 (89.5)2839 (10.5)χ2 = 16,838.06;df = 1;p < 0.001Genderχ2 = 0.24;df = 2;p = 0.8875 Men4364 (16.2)523 (1.9) Women19,734 (73.1)2309 (8.3) Other63 (0.2)7 (0.03)Age categoryχ2 = 237.73;df = 5;p < 0.001 18–24894 (3.3)61 (0.2) 25–343479 (12.9)249 (0.9) 35–445815 (21.5)497 (1.8) 45–545695 (21.1)701 (2.6) 55–643904 (14.5)618 (2.3)65 + 4374 (16.2)713 (2.6)Educationχ2 = 178.92;df = 2;p < 0.001 Primary and vocational2041 (7.6)387 (1.4) Secondary8713 (32.3)1222 (4.5) Higher13,407 (49.7)1230 (4.6)Urbanizationχ2 = 28.75;df = 6;p < 0.001 Countryside4875 (18.1)612 (2.3) City up to 19,000 citizens2758 (10.2)332 (1.2) City of 20,000–49,000 citizens3652 (13.5)485 (1.8) City of 50,000–99,000 citizens2621 (9.7)326 (1.2) City of 100,000–199,000 citizens2445 (9.1)295 (1.1) City of 200,000–499,000 citizens2737 (10.1)299 (1.1) City of 500,000+ citizens5073 (18.8)490 (1.8)
        Within the study sample, herpes labialis was the most prevalent condition, affecting 40.6% of participants, followed by dandruff and hair loss reported by 37.6% and 34.8% of respondents, respectively. Acne impacted 32.7% of those surveyed. Other common conditions included atopic dermatitis/eczema (25.5%), viral warts (20.2%), and tinea unguium (17.6%). Among potentially life-threatening skin diseases, melanoma was found in 1.1% of cases, while NMSC affected 1.7%.
      
      
        Gender Differences
        Gender-specific analysis revealed a similar set of prevalent diseases in both sexes, in differing orders of frequency. In males, the most common condition was dandruff (48.3%), followed by acne (32.9%), herpes labialis (31.6%), atopic dermatitis/eczema (27.5%), hair loss (27.1%), tinea unguium (20.0%), and viral warts (19.8%, Table 3).Table 3Prevalence of skin diseases stratified by gender [the numbers (n) and frequencies (%) of the occurrences of skin diseases among study sample; total: 27,000)TraitMalesFemalesOtherAllMale versus female difference significanceOR[−95% CI: +95% CI]Acneχ2 = 0.1df = 1p = 0.75541.0[1.0:1.1]Yes1606 (32.9)7193 (32.6)34 (48.6)8833 (32.7)No3281 (67.1)14,850 (67.4)36 (51.4)18,167 (67.3)Atopic dermatitis/eczemaχ2 = 12.72df = 1p < 0.0011.1[1.1:1.2]Yes1343 (27.5)5516 (25.0)27 (38.6)6886 (25.5)No3544 (72.5)16,527 (75.0)43 (61.4)20,114 (74.5)Dandruffχ2 = 290.93df = 1p < 0.0011.7[1.6:1.8]Yes2358 (48.3)7757 (35.2)36 (51.4)10,151 (37.6)No2529 (51.8)14,286 (64.8)34 (48.6)16,849 (62.4)Fungal skin infectionχ2 = 97.58df = 1p < 0.0011.7[1.6:2.0]Yes462 (9.5)1245 (5.7)8 (11.4)1715 (6.4)No4425 (90.6)20,798 (94.4)62 (88.6)25,285 (93.7)Furuncleχ2 = 54.28df = 1p < 0.0011.4[1.3:1.5]Yes705 (14.4)2364 (10.7)15 (21.4)3084 (11.4)No4182 (85.6)19,679 (89.3)55 (78.6)23,916 (88.6)Hair lossχ2 = 154.38df = 1p < 0.0010.6[0.6:0.7]Yes1324 (27.1)8034 (36.4)27 (38.6)9385 (34.8)No3563 (72.9)14,009 (63.6)43 (61.4)17,615 (65.2)Herpes labialisχ2 = 202.53df = 1p < 0.0010.6[0.6:0.7]Yes1542 (31.6)9391 (42.6)35 (50.0)10,968 (40.6)No3345 (68.5)12,652 (57.4)35 (50.0)16,032 (59.4)Melanomaχ2 = 17.7df = 1p < 0.0011.7[1.3:2.2]Yes81 (1.66)213 (1.0)2 (2.9)296 (1.1)No4806 (98.3)21,830 (99.0)68 (97.1)26,704 (98.9)Non-melanoma skin cancerχ2 = 21.72df = 1p < 0.0011.6[1.3:2.0]Yes121 (2.5)336 (1.5)2 (2.9)459 (1.7)No4766 (97.5)21,707 (98.5)68 (97.1)26,541 (98.3)Pemphigus/pemphigoidχ2 = 6.59df = 1p = 0.01031.7[1.1:2.6]Yes31 (0.6)82 (0.4)2 (2.9)115 (0.4)No4856 (99.4)21,961 (99.6)68 (97.1)26,885 (99.6)Psoriasisχ2 = 156.18df = 1p < 0.0012.1[1.8:2.3]Yes453 (9.27)1045 (4.74)5 (7.1)1503 (5.0)No4434 (90.73)20,998 (95.26)65 (92.9)25,497 (94.4)Rosaceaχ2 = 77.78df = 1p < 0.0010.6[0.5:0.7]Yes356 (7.3)2561 (11.6)13 (18.6)2930 (10.9)No4531 (92.7)19,482 (88.4)57 (81.4)24,070 (89.2)Seborrheic dermatitisχ2 = 116.6df = 1p < 0.0011.7[1.5:1.8]Yes691 (14.14)1990 (9.0)10 (14.3)2691 (10.0)No4196 (85.86)20,053 (91.0)60 (85.7)24,309 (90.0)Tinea pedisχ2 = 278.4df = 1p < 0.0012.1[1.9:2.3]Yes852 (17.4)2042 (9.3)9 (12.9)2903 (10.8)No4035 (82.6)20,001 (90.7)61 (87.1)24,097 (89.3)Tinea unguiumχ2 = 22.13df = 1p < 0.0011.2[1.1:1.3]Yes975 (20.0)3773 (17.1)10 (143)4758 (17.6)No3912 (80.1)18,270 (82.9)60 (85.7)22,242 (82.4)Viral wartsχ2 = 0.6df = 1p = 0.43881.0[0.9:1.1]Yes967 (19.8)4470 (20.3)14 (20.0)5451 (20.2)No3920 (80.2)17,573 (79.7)56 (80.0)21,549 (79.8)Vitiligoχ2 = 8.1df = 1p = 0.00441.3[1.1:1.6]Yes148 (3.0)514 (2.3)6 (8.6)668 (2.5)No4739 (97.0)21,529 (97.7)64 (91.4)26,332 (97.5)Other bacterial or viral skin infectionχ2 = 10.25df = 1p = 0.00141.2[1.1:1.3]Yes555 (11.4)2167 (9.8)16 (22.9)2738 (10.1)No4332 (88.6)19,876 (90.2)54 (77.1)24,262 (89.9)Other hair or nail diseaseχ2 = 12.68df = 1p < 0.0010.7[0.6:0.9]Yes163 (3.3)986 (4.5)6 (8.6)1155 (4.3)No4724 (96.7)21,057 (95.5)64 (91.4)25,845 (95.7)Other skin diseaseχ2 = 16.99df = 1p < 0.0011.3[1.1:1.4]Yes450 (9.2)1645 (7.5)13 (18.6)2108 (7.8)No4437 (90.8)20,398 (92.5)57 (81.5)24,892 (92.2)
        In females, the most common condition was herpes labialis (42.6%), followed by hair loss (36.4%), dandruff (35.2%), acne (32.6%), atopic dermatitis/eczema (25.0%), viral warts (20.3%), and tinea unguium (17.1%, Table 3).
        Analysis of gender influence revealed significant disparities in the prevalence of most skin conditions. Men were approximately two times more likely to experience tinea pedis (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.90–2.30) and psoriasis (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.80–2.30). They also showed substantially higher odds of fungal skin infection (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.60–2.00), dandruff (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.60–1.80), pemphigus/pemphigoid (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.10–2.60), melanoma (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.30–2.20), seborrhoeic dermatitis (OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.70–1.80), and NMSC (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.34–2.02). In contrast, women had a higher likelihood of exhibiting rosacea (male versus female OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.50–0.70), herpes labialis (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.60–0.70), and hair loss (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.60–0.70). Logistic regression models additionally revealed an increased likelihood of developing acne, atopic dermatitis/eczema, vitiligo, furuncle, and tinea unguium in men, while female gender was associated with a higher probability of viral warts and hair loss (Supplementary Table S5).
      
      
        Age-Related Patterns
        When examining age-related differences in the occurrence of skin diseases collectively (without gender stratification) statistically significant differences were observed across all studied areas. Acne prevalence was highest in younger age cohorts (18–24 years old: 59.9%) and decreased with advancing age (> 65 years old: 12.8%, Supplementary Table S6). Furthermore, atopic dermatitis/eczema was observed in the 18–24 years age group (31.9%), with a decreasing frequency in subsequent age groups from 25 years onward (> 65 years old, 20.1%). The same tendency was also observed among individuals dealing with dandruff (53.0% among those aged 18–24 years versus 25.9% among participants older than 65 years old). In contrast, the number of participants with psoriasis, vitiligo, furuncle, melanoma, NMSC, pemphigus/pemphigoid, tinea pedis, viral warts, and other hair or nail disease increased with age (Supplementary Table S6).
        Individuals aged 18–24 years old were approximately four times more likely to have acne (OR = 3.7, 95% CI: 3.2–4.3, Supplementary Fig. S1A) and almost twice likely to have dandruff (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.7–2.1, Supplementary Fig. S1B) compared with the 45–54 year age group. In contrast, adults older than 65 years were over three times more likely to have skin cancer (OR = 3.5, 95% CI: 2.7–4.6) than their younger counterparts (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
        To delineate the association between gender and different group ages and exhibited skin diseases, we separated the total sample into males and females and examined the likelihood to exhibit tested skin diseases. Among male participants, an increasing tendency with age was observed among individuals suffering from psoriasis (4.7% in the group aged 18–24 years versus 11.1% in participants aged more than 65 years old), vitiligo (1.16% versus 3.1% for those aged 18–24 years old and more than 65 years old, respectively), furuncle (4.7% for participants between 18 and 24 years old versus 19.8% for those aged > 65 years old), and NMSC (74 participants aged more than 65 years old reported NMSC, while no participant aged 18–24 years old reported this disease). Furthermore, the number of participants exhibiting pemphigus/pemphigoid, tinea unguium, tinea pedis, viral warts, and hair loss increased with age. In contrast, the exceptional decreasing tendency with age was observed among males with acne; older participants were less likely to have acne, as compared with their younger counterparts (54.7% among participants aged 18–24 years old versus 16.7% among participants aged more than 65 years old; Supplementary Table S2). Women showed very similar results, showing the decreasing tendency of acne with age (59.9% of women aged 18–24 years old versus 12.8% of women older than 65 years; Supplementary Table S2), while a significant age-dependent increase in prevalence was observed for conditions including psoriasis, vitiligo, furuncle, NMSC, pemphigus/pemphigoid, tinea unguium, tinea pedis, and viral warts. Gender-specific analysis revealed distinctive patterns: female subjects demonstrated a positive correlation between age and melanoma incidence, as well as an inverse correlation with atopic dermatitis/eczema prevalence—patterns not observed in the male cohort. In addition, unlike their male counterparts, female subjects showed no significant age-associated increase in the prevalence of hair loss.
      
      
        Education Level
        In the analyzed sample, hair loss, dandruff, and acne were the most common diseases regardless of education level. Analyzing the data collectively regardless of gender, as well as examining women and men separately, the diseases that occurred statistically more frequently in individuals with higher education were: acne, seborrhoeic dermatitis, fungal skin infection, herpes labialis, dandruff, atopic dermatitis/eczema, viral warts, rosacea, and other bacterial or viral skin infections. Psoriasis and melanoma were most common in individuals with primary and vocational education. An interesting phenomenon was that hair loss occurred most frequently in men with higher education, while in women it was most common with primary and vocational education (Supplementary Table S3).
        On the basis of logistic regression models, higher education was associated with increased risk of several skin conditions (compared with secondary and post-secondary education), including acne (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.40–1.60, Supplementary Fig. S1A), seborrheic dermatitis (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.10–1.30), fungal skin infection (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.20–1.40), herpes labialis (OR = 1.30 95% CI: 1.20–1.30), furuncle (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.20–1.40), NMSC (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.20–1.80, Supplementary Fig. S1C), other bacterial or viral skin infection (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.10–1.30), tinea pedis (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00–1.20), dandruff (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.10–1.20, Supplementary Fig. S1B), viral warts (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.30–1.50), and other skin disease (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00–1.20, Supplementary Table S2). Respondents with higher education were less likely to suffer from psoriasis (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00) and tinea unguium (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00, Supplementary Table S3; Supplementary Fig. S2).
        Lower education was associated with an increased risk of melanoma (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.00–2.10) and tinea pedis (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00–1.30), and with a lower prevalence of diseases such as acne (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.60–0.80), herpes labialis (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.70–0.80), furuncle (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.90), skin cancer other than melanoma (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.40–1.00), and viral warts (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00).
      
      
        Urbanization
        Across all categories of place of residence, the most common diseases were dandruff, acne, herpes labialis, and hair loss (Supplementary Table S8).
        Although the frequency of many conditions varied significantly depending on the place of residence, logistic regression models demonstrated that urbanization influenced the occurrence of only a few of the studied skin diseases. Residents of large cities (> 500,000 inhabitants) showed higher likelihood of certain skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis/eczema (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00–1.30, Supplementary Fig. S3A) and NMSC (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.40–2.90, Supplementary Fig. S1C). Consistently, rural residents had lower odds of some conditions, such as atopic dermatitis/eczema (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00, Supplementary Fig. S3A), seborrheic dermatitis (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.90, Supplementary Fig. S3B), and viral warts (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80–1.00, Supplementary Fig. S3C, Supplementary Table S2). The frequency of the studied skin diseases depending on urbanization with gender stratification is presented in Supplementary Table S4.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      This large-scale cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of common self-reported physician-diagnosed skin conditions and their associated risk factors among adult internet users in Poland. Our findings indicate a high overall burden of skin conditions, with 89.5% of the 27,000 participants reporting at least one condition. The most prevalent were herpes labialis (40.6%), dandruff (37.6%), hair loss (34.8%), and acne (32.7%). Consistent with our primary objectives and initial hypothesis, significant variations in prevalence were observed on the basis of gender, age, education level, and urbanization, highlighting specific demographic and socioeconomic correlates for various dermatological diseases within this sample.
      This study provides valuable insights into the prevalence and distribution of skin diseases among a large sample of 27,000 participants in Poland. Our findings reveal significant patterns in the occurrence of various skin conditions, highlighting important demographic factors that influence their prevalence within this group. Our results indicate that skin diseases are remarkably common, with 89.5% of participants reporting at least one skin condition. This percentage is significantly higher than that obtained from the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) survey in 2022, which reported 43.35% [1]. However, as noted in our methods, it is important to note that the EADV study inquired about the presence of disease within the past 12 months and employed a different sampling strategy across multiple countries, whereas our research focused on lifetime occurrence within a specific online Polish sample. The high reported lifetime prevalence we observed in our specific cohort emphasizes the potential scale of dermatological concerns and the ongoing significance of dermatological care in health management in Poland, though direct comparisons require caution owing to methodological differences.
      The widespread occurrence of self-reported physician-diagnosed herpes labialis (40.6%), dandruff (37.6%), hair loss (34.8%), and acne vulgaris (32.7%) across the entire study sample underscores the significant reported burden of these conditions among Polish internet users participating in this survey. While direct comparisons are challenging due to methodological differences (e.g., lifetime versus point or period prevalence, case definitions, and study populations), these figures can be contextualized with broader epidemiological data. For example, the lifetime prevalence of acne (32.7%) in our predominantly adult online sample appears higher than the global point prevalence of acne vulgaris, estimated at 9.4% by the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study, which reported 231.2 million prevalent cases worldwide in that year [16]. However, some studies focusing on lifetime exposure to acne have reported figures ranging from 57.8% to 73.3% in different populations [17], suggesting that a significant portion of the population experiences acne at some point. A recent large-scale German claims data study by Kirsten et al. (2021) found an administrative point prevalence of acne in adults (> 25 years) of 1.50% and in adolescents (≤ 25 years) of 3.88% in 2020 [18], figures much lower than our lifetime self-report but reflecting actively managed cases in a healthcare system.
      Regarding herpes labialis, our reported lifetime prevalence of 40.6% among Polish internet users can be compared with a 2021 meta-analysis by Roy et al., which included 12 European studies and found a pooled prevalence of recurrent herpes labialis (RHL) in European adults of 13% [19]. The higher figure in our study is likely influenced by the lifetime recall period for any physician-diagnosed episode, compared with studies often assessing more recent or recurrent episodes, and the specific characteristics of our self-selected online sample. Nevertheless, both our findings and these broader studies indicate that acne and herpes labialis are highly common conditions. Dandruff and nonspecific hair loss, while highly prevalent in our sample, are more challenging to compare directly with robust epidemiological literature due to varying definitions and often being self-managed conditions.
      The prevalence of self-reported physician-diagnosed melanoma (1.1%), a potentially life-threatening skin disease, and NMSC (1.7%), which although rarely life-threatening still requires medical attention, represents a considerable number of reported cases given the large sample size. These figures underline the importance of ongoing public health initiatives for skin cancer awareness and prevention. However, the unexpectedly high ratio of reported melanoma to NMSC in our findings (approximately 1:1.5 compared with the expected 1:18–20 in European cancer registries) strongly suggests a significant potential for respondent misclassification rather than a true epidemiological pattern within our dataset. This observation is a key limitation concerning the validity of self-reported cancer diagnoses in survey research. Highlighting the need for improved public education about different types of skin cancers and their characteristics is crucial, even when individuals recall a physician diagnosis. It is noteworthy that NMSCs, comprising basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), represent a significant and increasing global burden, particularly among older adults, as detailed in analyses of the Global Burden of Disease Study [25]. The study by Pan et al. (2025) highlights substantial increases in the incidence of both BCC (291.85% increase in cases globally for older adults, 1990–2021) and SCC (322.77% increase in cases globally for older adults, 1990–2021), underscoring the public health importance of accurately tracking these conditions.
      Our study revealed significant gender-based differences in the prevalence of various skin conditions within our sample. Men showed higher odds for several diseases, including seborrheic dermatitis (OR = 1.70), psoriasis (OR = 2.10), dandruff (OR = 1.70), fungal skin infections (OR = 1.70), melanoma (OR = 1.70), and NMSC (OR = 1.60), after adjustment for other factors (Supplementary Table S5). These findings regarding psoriasis and fungal infections are consistent with current scientific knowledge on this subject [20, 21]. This male predisposition to certain skin conditions could be attributed to various factors such as hormonal differences, lifestyle habits, or occupational exposures [22].
      Conversely, women in our sample exhibited higher odds for conditions such as herpes labialis (OR = 0.60 for males versus females) and rosacea (OR = 0.60 for males versus females). The increased prevalence of herpes labialis in women (42.6% versus 31.6% in men) is particularly noteworthy and may warrant further investigation into potential contributing factors, such as hormonal influences or differences in healthcare-seeking behavior [22].
      Interestingly, the multivariate analysis, which accounted for age, place of residence, and education, revealed some discrepancies with crude univariate associations. For instance, the higher frequency of acne and atopic dermatitis/eczema in males observed in the multivariate analysis (Supplementary Table S5) suggests that these conditions may be influenced by complex interactions between gender and other demographic factors when these factors are considered simultaneously.
      The age-related patterns observed in our study provide valuable insights into the lifecycle of various skin conditions as reported by our participants. The decreasing prevalence of acne with age aligns with the well-established understanding of acne as a condition predominantly affecting younger individuals [14]. Similarly, the higher reported prevalence of atopic dermatitis/eczema in younger age groups corroborates existing literature on the typical onset and course of this condition [23]. The increasing prevalence of conditions such as psoriasis and NMSC with age highlights the cumulative nature of these diseases and the potential role of long-term environmental exposures or age-related changes in skin physiology [24, 26]. A recent scoping review by Kottner et al. (2024) focusing on community-living older people (≥ 60 years) also identified sun exposure and age-related skin conditions such as actinic keratoses, xerosis cutis, neoplasms (including NMSCs), and inflammatory diseases as highly frequent [30]. For instance, the prevalence of NMSC in our > 65 years group (4.0%) falls within the broad ranges (0.4–6.9% for NMSC) summarized by Kottner et al. from various studies in older populations. Similarly, our finding of psoriasis prevalence increasing to 7.9% in the > 65 years group can be contextualized with the 0.5–14.8% range for psoriasis reported in their review for older adults. These findings underscore the importance of age-specific preventive measures and screenings for skin diseases, should these trends be confirmed in the general population.
      The association between higher education and an increased self-reported risk of skin conditions, including acne, seborrheic dermatitis, and various infections, is an intriguing finding from our specific sample. This correlation could be attributed to several factors including increased awareness and health-seeking behavior among more educated individuals, leading to higher rates of diagnosis and reporting which might not necessarily reflect a true higher incidence but rather better case ascertainment in this subgroup [27]. Conversely, the lower reported prevalence of psoriasis and tinea unguium among those with higher education suggests that the relationship between education and skin health is complex and condition-specific.
      The complex relationship between educational attainment and skin disease prevalence observed in our study warrants nuanced interpretation. Rather than suggesting direct causality, these associations within our internet-using sample likely reflect a constellation of interconnected factors. Higher reporting of conditions such as acne, seborrheic dermatitis, and fungal infections among those with higher education likely stems from a combination of increased health literacy, greater awareness of dermatological conditions, enhanced access to healthcare services, and potentially different healthcare-seeking behaviors. Conversely, the higher reported prevalence of psoriasis and tinea unguium among those with lower educational attainment may reflect differing occupational exposures, lifestyle factors, or environmental conditions not captured in our study. The inverse relationship between education and psoriasis (OR = 0.9 for higher education) is particularly noteworthy and aligns with observations in other chronic inflammatory conditions where socioeconomic gradients have been documented. These findings underscore the importance of considering social determinants of health in dermatological care and suggest that public health interventions might need to be tailored to address these socioeconomic dimensions, pending further research in representative samples.
      The influence of urbanization on skin disease prevalence in our sample, while less pronounced than other factors, still yields some noteworthy observations. The higher likelihood of reporting skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis or NMSC in large city residents (more than 500,000 inhabitants) aligns with concepts such as the “hygiene hypothesis” and the potential role of environmental factors in these conditions [28]. On the contrary, the lower odds of reporting certain conditions in rural residents, such as viral warts or hair loss, may reflect differences in lifestyle, environmental exposures, or access to healthcare between urban and rural areas [29].
      The geographical patterns revealed in our analysis suggest a complex urban–rural divide in dermatological health among our participants. The increased prevalence of atopic dermatitis/eczema (OR = 1.20) and NMSC (OR = 2.00) in large metropolitan areas with populations exceeding 500,000 inhabitants points to potential environmental factors at play or differences in healthcare access leading to diagnosis. Urban environments typically feature higher concentrations of air pollutants, different occupational profiles, and potentially higher ultraviolet radiation exposure due to outdoor recreational activities, all of which may contribute to these conditions. Conversely, rural residents in our sample showed lower odds of reporting conditions such as seborrheic dermatitis (OR = 0.80) and viral warts (OR = 0.90), which could reflect differences in population density affecting transmission patterns or reporting differences due to healthcare access disparities. These geographical variations highlight the importance of considering regionally tailored approaches to dermatological care. The substantial difference in reported NMSC prevalence between major urban centers and smaller communities (OR = 2.00) is particularly concerning and suggests potential screening and detection disparities that should be addressed through mobile screening initiatives or enhanced training of primary care providers in rural settings, if these findings are representative of broader population trends.
      The findings from this epidemiological study, while primarily reflecting a large sample of Polish internet users, have potential implications for public health strategies and healthcare resource allocation in Poland, should they be corroborated by population-representative data. Our data suggest several targeted approaches that could improve dermatological care: First, the high prevalence of common conditions such as herpes labialis (40.6%), dandruff (37.6%), and acne (32.7%) highlights a potentially high self-perceived burden and the need for improved access to basic dermatological care and over-the-counter treatments. Second, the distinct age-related patterns observed for various conditions indicate opportunities for age-targeted screening and prevention programs—particularly for skin cancer detection in older age groups (e.g., those over 65 years in our sample), where prevalence increased substantially. Third, our gender-stratified analysis suggests that dermatological education and awareness campaigns could potentially benefit from gender-specific content addressing the conditions most relevant to each group, such as seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis for men, and rosacea and herpes labialis for women, as suggested by our data. Finally, the notable socioeconomic and geographical variations in disease prevalence seen in our sample point to potential disparities in care access that merit further attention from health policymakers. Implementation of teledermatology services could help bridge these gaps, particularly for underserved rural populations that showed different disease patterns compared with urban centers in our study.
      Several limitations of this study must be carefully considered when interpreting its findings. Foremost, the significant gender imbalance in the study sample (81.7% female versus 18.1% male) and the overrepresentation of individuals with higher education (54.2%) compared with national figures (approximately 51.7% female in the adult population; ~28–30% with tertiary education) severely limit the generalizability of our prevalence estimates to the entire Polish population, particularly for male-specific conditions or those less common in highly educated or female demographics. This gender disparity likely resulted from self-selection bias in our online recruitment methodology, as women and more educated individuals tend to exhibit higher participation rates in health-related surveys. Consequently, our results are most applicable to Polish adult internet users, predominantly female and with higher education, who engage with online health information.
      The reliance on self-reported clinically diagnosed conditions introduces significant methodological challenges. Although the survey specifically asked about diseases that had been “diagnosed,” respondents may have interpreted this differently—some reporting only physician-confirmed diagnoses while others potentially including self-diagnosed conditions. This introduces condition-specific reporting biases; while easily recognizable conditions such as acne may be accurately reported as diagnosed, more complex diagnoses such as melanoma versus NMSC showed evidence of substantial misclassification (with a reported ratio of 1:1.5 instead of the expected 1:18–20).
      Furthermore, the study focused on a preselected list of 20 common skin conditions. This means that other frequently encountered dermatological issues, such as dry skin (xerosis cutis), which was not specifically queried, were not captured. Consequently, while providing data on the selected conditions, our findings may not represent the total burden of all skin complaints in the surveyed population, and the prevalence of dermatological issues not on our list remains unassessed by this study. In addition, online survey distribution inherently excludes populations with limited internet access or digital literacy, particularly affecting older individuals and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds or remote rural areas—potentially underrepresenting these groups in our sample and influencing the observed prevalence of conditions more common in these populations. The cross-sectional nature of the study precludes establishing causal relationships between demographic factors and skin disease prevalence; all reported associations are correlational. Furthermore, our urbanization analysis fails to account for residential mobility throughout participants’ lives. Many respondents may have relocated between rural and urban settings over their lifetime, making current residence an imperfect proxy for lifetime environmental exposure patterns. Another significant methodological challenge arises from our lifetime prevalence approach for age-related analyses. Logically, older participants should report higher lifetime prevalence for most conditions simply due to longer exposure time. The fact that some conditions such as atopic dermatitis show lower prevalence in older age groups despite accumulating over a lifetime suggests potential recall bias, cohort effects, or changing diagnostic practices across generations. These temporal considerations significantly complicate interpretation of age-related findings. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that individuals with existing skin conditions were more motivated to participate (participation bias), potentially inflating overall prevalence estimates compared with what might be found in the general population.
      It is also crucial to consider the distinction between statistical significance and clinical relevance, particularly given our study’s large sample size. With 27,000 participants, even small absolute differences in prevalence or modest odds ratios can reach statistical significance without necessarily representing meaningful clinical or public health distinctions. For example, the difference in vitiligo prevalence between males and females (3.0% versus 2.3%, p = 0.0044) in our sample is statistically significant but represents a small absolute difference of 0.7 percentage points. Throughout our analysis, while reporting all statistically significant findings, we have attempted to highlight findings with both statistical significance and more substantial effect sizes, such as the larger gender differences observed in psoriasis (OR = 2.1), seborrheic dermatitis (OR = 1.7), and dandruff (OR = 1.7), which are more likely to reflect true biological or behavioral differences rather than statistical artifacts alone.
      The observed prevalence ratio between self-reported melanoma (1.1%) and NMSC (1.7%) warrants particular attention as a specific example of a study limitation related to information bias. As previously mentioned, this deviates substantially from established epidemiological patterns (expected ~1:18–20 in European cancer registries). Our findings therefore suggest a potential misclassification issue in self-reporting of these conditions. This inconsistency likely stems from several factors: diagnostic confusion among respondents even when recalling a physician’s diagnosis, the higher public awareness of melanoma compared with NMSCs, or potentially the tendency to recall more serious diagnoses. Among older participants (> 65 years) in our sample, the ratio improves somewhat (1.8% melanoma versus 4.0% non-melanoma), better approximating expected patterns, possibly reflecting more accurate diagnosis or reporting in this population segment with higher overall skin cancer prevalence. This finding underscores the caution needed when interpreting self-reported cancer data from surveys. Indeed, even large-scale studies such as the Global Burden of Disease acknowledge challenges in NMSC data due to inconsistent recording in cancer registries globally, necessitating complex estimation processes [30].
      Future research directions could encompass several key areas to build upon these findings and address their limitations. Longitudinal studies would be valuable to examine the progression and causal risk factors for skin diseases in the Polish context. Efforts to achieve more balanced gender representation and recruit samples more representative of the general Polish population, potentially through mixed-mode data collection or registry-based approaches, are crucial for obtaining more robust national prevalence estimates and ensuring broader generalizability. Including clinical examinations or linkage to medical records could help validate self-reported diagnoses and potentially uncover undiagnosed conditions. Further investigation into additional factors such as detailed lifestyle habits (e.g., diet, smoking patterns, specific sun protection behaviors), occupational exposures, and genetic predispositions could shed light on their relation to skin disease prevalence. Lastly, exploring the economic and quality-of-life impacts of the high reported prevalence of skin diseases observed in this study would provide crucial insights for healthcare planning and demonstrating the broader implications of these conditions.
    
    
      Conclusions
      This large-scale cross-sectional online survey study provides valuable initial insights into the self-reported lifetime prevalence of a range of common skin conditions and their associated risk factors among a sample of 27,000 adult internet users in Poland. Our findings from this specific sample highlight significant variations in reported prevalence based on gender, age, education level, and urbanization. The high reported lifetime prevalence of common skin conditions in this cohort underscores the potential substantial burden these diseases may place on public health systems and individuals’ quality of life if these patterns are reflective of broader population trends. The observed demographic patterns offer preliminary data and hypotheses for tailoring preventive strategies, allocating healthcare resources, and guiding future research efforts in dermatology and public health in Poland, pending further validation in representative population samples.
      Our findings from this study of Polish internet users emphasize the potential need for targeted interventions and public health initiatives that consider the demographic and socioeconomic factors influencing skin disease prevalence. By addressing these conditions through a lens that accounts for gender, age, education, and urbanization, healthcare providers and policymakers can work towards more effective prevention, early detection, and management of skin diseases within similar populations and can inform the design of broader public health strategies, subject to confirmation of these findings in the general Polish population.

Title: Self-determined strategies for physical activity motivation among women with polycystic ovary syndrome

Abstract: Background:According to clinical practice guidelines for polycystic ovary syndrome, first-line treatment includes performing 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on most days of the week plus at least 2 days of resistance training. However, <40% of women with polycystic ovary syndrome engage in regular physical activity, and about 60% are sedentary. Research evidence supports theory-informed physical activity interventions to improve motivation for physical activity. This study examined the fit of a behavioral change theory for women with polycystic ovary syndrome.Objectives:The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze physical activity barriers through the lens of self-determination theory and identify motivational strategies that may promote initiation and maintenance of physical activity among women with polycystic ovary syndrome.Design:The study involved a qualitative, descriptive design using theory-driven thematic analysis.Methods:After emailing a demographic questionnaire and Personal Health Questionnaire-8 to screen for depressive symptoms, participants (n = 7) met three times via Zoom during the summer of 2021. Meetings were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed.Results:Participants were aged 33.9 (±8.1) years, premenopausal, mostly White (71%), educated (100% with at least some college), employed full-time (86%), and married (86%) with a mean depressive symptoms score of 6.4 (±3.4) indicating mild depression. Strategies such as a buddy system, physician support, technology, and behavioral change techniques are necessary to meet the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness among women with polycystic ovary syndrome to help increase exercise motivation.Conclusion:Findings supported the use of self-determination theory by emphasizing that the social context of polycystic ovary syndrome can undermine physical activity behavior. Thus, physical activity interventions should consider the social context, peer support system, and mental health status of women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and include tailored programs and motivational strategies to help meet the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

Body: Introduction
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common endocrinopathy among women,
1
 affects about 20 million women in the United States across all races and ethnicities.
2
 PCOS is a complex, heterogenous collection of symptoms involving hormonal dysregulation.
1
 Diagnosis of PCOS occurs when two of three of the following conditions are present: menstrual irregularities, clinical or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism, and/or polycystic ovarian morphology.
3
 PCOS is associated with central adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and depressive symptoms, placing the women at risk for cardiometabolic diseases, reproductive cancers,
4
 and psychological morbidity.
5
 Women with PCOS are three to eight times more likely to have depressive symptoms
6
 and seven times more likely to attempt suicide
7
 than women without PCOS.
      Physical activity (PA) has been well-established as a therapy for managing PCOS symptoms and reducing the risk of comorbidities.
3
 PA is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles requiring energy expenditure.
8
 PA includes exercise, both aerobic and resistance, which is planned, structured bodily movement with a fitness goal.
8
 As such, the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice PCOS Guidelines recommend that women with PCOS follow the PA guideline of 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity to prevent or delay the onset of comorbidities, as well as improve cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass index, and quality-of-life.3,8 Resistance exercise is recommended on at least 2 days/week,
3
 as it has been shown to increase metabolic capacity via increased lean mass, reduce insulin resistance, and increase bone mineral density,9,10 while reducing depressive symptoms among those with and without clinical depression, and more in women with PCOS than in women without PCOS.3,9
–15 However, <40% of women with PCOS engage in regular PA, and about 60% are sedentary.16,17
      PCOS-specific PA barriers have been reported as stigma-related stress due to appearance (e.g. hirsutism, obesity), symptom burden (e.g. depressive symptoms, fatigue), and lack of understanding of the condition by society in general, time, and confidence.18,19 These barriers impede motivation to exercise, especially in group-based and public settings, necessitating a search for effective and meaningful strategies to improve motivation. Research evidence supports interventions underpinned by theory and inclusive of psychological support.
20
 Motivation determines the initiation and maintenance of PA, as motivation drives all aspects of intention, activation, and persistence of goal-directed behavior.
21
 Interventions informed by self-determination theory (SDT) have growing evidence of improving motivation by identifying supports that help meet psychological needs.
22
 When psychological needs are met, people attain more intrinsic motivation to exercise, which may lead to behavioral engagement.22
–25 Thus, the purposes of this qualitative descriptive study were to explore PA barriers through the lens of SDT and identify motivational strategies that may promote the initiation and maintenance of PA among women with PCOS.
    
    
      Theoretical framework
      The science of health behavior change has increasingly emphasized theory-based approaches to intervention, as theories help identify underlying mechanisms of action and proximal targets of intervention (i.e. mediators and moderators).21,22 SDT, as introduced by Ryan and Deci, is a metatheory for the study of human motivation, personality development, and well-being.
23
 The underlying assumption of SDT is that humans not only are naturally inspired and agentic, but also require social supports or strategies to develop and maintain natural potential and well-being. SDT intersects personality and social context to predict the likelihood of adopting and maintaining a behavior, such as PA, by predominantly focusing on a taxonomy of motivations and three innate psychological needs.
      SDT was chosen as the lens for structuring the study, given its focus on motivation within unique social contexts. SDT explains that social norms may suppress an individual’s innate psychological needs of autonomy (freedom to choose a behavior), competence (ability to perform and master a behavior), and relatedness (sense of belonginess).
23
 Unmet needs suppress natural self-governing and create a shift in motivation away from self-determined behavior to more externally motivated behavior. Furthermore, based on SDT, individuals with decreased motivation require multiple strategies to improve need satisfaction. Thus, the extent to which people meet these psychological needs dictates their position on the continuum of motivation. Researchers that have employed an SDT perspective found that self-determination and motivational orientation, along with self-efficacy, offered an appropriate framework to further understand PA behavior among those with chronic health conditions

      Materials and methods
      
        Design and ethics approval
        A qualitative descriptive study was conducted from May 2021 to December 2021. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and 45 CFR 46.104(d)(2) and 45 CFR 46.111(a)(7). The University of South Carolina (USC) Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study (Pro00105265, December 7, 2020). As approved by the USC IRB, verbal consent was obtained from participants prior to each virtual meeting. The interviewer was supported by NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award (1F31 NR019206-01A1).
      
      
        Study setting and sample
        A focus group was formed of women with PCOS (n = 7) to analyze exercise barriers through the lens of SDT and identify motivational strategies that may promote initiation and maintenance of PA among women with PCOS from the perspective of women with PCOS. Our recruitment goal was for 6–10 individuals to keep the group size manageable and its participants comfortable sharing their expertise while also achieving diversity of opinion. Participants were recruited using the snowball method and social media, which allowed for a wider geographic reach and more diversity among a small group of participants. The researchers had no previous relationships with the participants. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was conducted virtually and used secure email to distribute and collect surveys.
      
      
        Inclusion/exclusion criteria
        Eligibility criteria were premenopausal women with a confirmed diagnosis of PCOS by a healthcare provider, an age of 18–42 years, and internet access for virtual meetings. Potential participants were required to submit via secured email confirmation of a PCOS diagnosis by a healthcare provider to be considered for the study. The age range was chosen based on a systematic review and meta-analysis that defined the start of the menopausal transition for women with PCOS at or greater than the age 45 years.
27

      
      
        Measures
        
          Demographics
          The demographic questionnaire included age, race, geographic location, educational attainment, employment and insurance status, marital status, number of children, height, weight, and comorbidities (see Supplemental Appendix A).
        
        
          Depressive symptoms
          The Personal Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) is one of several tools used to assess depressive symptoms among women with PCOS in previous studies, and it has been recommended for symptom monitoring among patients with medical (versus psychiatric) diagnoses.
28
 As such, the PHQ-8 was used to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms experienced within the past 2 weeks. The PHQ-8 consists of eight items with a four-point rating ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). As a screening instrument, PHQ-8 scores suggest potential levels depression based on the number of depressive symptoms: 5–9 mild, 10–19 moderate, and ⩾20 major.
29
 Construct validity was reported at 0.75 and internal reliability was reported at 0.81.
29

        
      
      
        Virtual meetings
        The focus group met three times for ~1 h/meeting. The virtual meetings took place during the summer months spaced apart by ~3 weeks. The researcher (P.J.W.) introduced the purpose of the focus group. Meetings were structured by using an SDT-informed interview guide (see Supplemental Appendix B) created by the first author (P.J.W.), a doctoral-prepared female nurse researcher with experience working with and recruiting women with PCOS, and the second author (R.M.D.), a female qualitative methodologist and nurse practitioner familiar with PCOS medical management. Interview guides were specifically developed to address knowledge, facilitators, and barriers of PA,19,30 SDT psychological needs,
23
 and strategies to increase motivation. Meetings were conducted by P.J.W. and audio-recorded via Zoom, a cloud-based videoconferencing service. Zoom offers the ability to communicate in real-time with participants in different geographic locations via computer or mobile device. This platform was chosen because it has several privacy features including user authentication, secure recording and storage, and real-time meeting encryption. Field notes were made during the focus group meetings. The recordings were transcribed and then compared to the audio to ensure that they accurately represented the participants’ discussion. Each participant received a $20 e-gift card per meeting for their time and expertise.
      
      
        Data analysis
        Using theory-driven thematic analysis,
31
 the data were organized and categorized based on predetermined themes drawn from SDT. Two researchers (P.J.W. and R.M.D.) independently coded the responses using deductive reasoning according to the three SDT psychological needs. Subsequently, an iterative categorization process was followed to organize data according to theoretical constructs. The two researchers discussed data saturation and unanimously agreed that data saturation had been reached after the three focus group meetings. Rigor was strengthened through the reflexivity of the researchers via reflexive journaling and regular meetings to discuss personal experiences and knowledge of both PCOS and PA in relation to the statements of the focus group participants. Rigor was further enhanced by following COREQ guidelines
32
 (see Supplementary File).
      
    
    
      Results
      Participants (n = 7) represented three U.S. states (South Carolina, Georgia, and Texas) and four different counties in South Carolina, both rural and suburban. Participants were 33.9 (±8.1) years of age, mostly White (71%), married (86%), and employed full-time (86%). The participants’ mean depressive symptom score was 6.4 (±3.4), indicating “mild depression.” Participants’ characteristics are listed in Table 1.

      The PHQ-8 scores of the three participants who reported depression as a comorbidity corresponded.
      All focus group participants acknowledged the multiple health benefits of exercise. However, all reported being insufficiently active, that is, they did not regularly accumulate 150 min of moderate intensity PA most days of the week. All focus group participants reported using extrinsic motivation to make decisions about PA behavior. For example, one participant was motivated by incentives such as discounts on facility memberships and another participant was motivated by her physician’s guidance to lose weight. No participant represented amotivation nor fully self-determined intrinsic motivation. When asked to rank the SDT psychological needs in general, focus group participants unanimously agreed that relatedness was most important, with mixed responses about whether competence or autonomy would follow.
      Themes were deductively categorized by the three psychological needs of SDT. A fourth theme, motivational strategies, comprised focus group participants’ suggestions for improving exercise motivation. Quotes illuminating the themes are italicized and presented as stated by the focus group participants and are minimally edited for clarity (e.g. removal of dysfluencies). Participants’ initial and age follow each quote.
      
        Autonomy: And it was something else that hindered me
        Autonomy is the volitional choice and control of one’s behavior. Internal and external factors impact autonomy by creating shifts in perception of priorities. The women filled multiple roles (e.g. spouse, mother, daughter, employee, student, patient), resulting in daily competing time demands. As a result, the women felt a loss of control in their ability to schedule time for PA: My barrier is time.
        
Life just got in the way. (M, 41)Other barriers, children, family, school, blah, blah, blah, blah get in the way. (C, 37)My biggest struggle is making the time and making that a priority over other things. (S, 29)

        As women who struggle with PCOS, some women expressed being robbed of choice due to comorbid conditions, such as hidradenitis suppurativa (inflamed and infected sweat glands; n = 1) and depression (n = 3).
        
Other factors that go with PCOS impede physical activity. Hidradenitis suppurativa is one of those factors. So the sweat glands may become clogged, they break out into boils and they have to be surgically removed. So the more you sweat, the more there’s pain. (M, 42)It (PCOS) was affecting me mentally . . . so like depression and just like . . . hopelessness. Um, so, you know, I never exercised. (J, 23)

        Hyperandrogenism is a feature of PCOS with physical sequelae such as obesity, hirsutism, and acne. Several women expressed feeling “unattractive” and having poor self-image, which led to avoidance of PA in public places.
        
You hate your body and you feel fat all the time. (T, 24)

        Autonomous choices were also limited by facility location and costs.
        
And the next closest one (gym) is 30 minutes away. (C, 37)And so there’s also the monetary component to it as well. (M, 42)

      
      
        Competence: (Lack of weight loss) crushed my spirit. And, ever since then, I haven’t tried to do anything
        Competence involves the sense of mastery and self-efficacy of one’s behavior and the need to feel effective when performing that behavior. A person will more likely accomplish a task or meet a goal when feeling capable of successfully performing the related activities, or when the task results in the expected outcome.
        
[Exercise] gave me a sense of accomplishment. (J, 23)It’s (the body) working correctly and everything’s going great and you’re powerful, I think that’s the most rewarding thing about it. (S, 29)

        When one feels ineffective, incompetent, or unable to accomplish a task or goal, the effort may seem meaningless.
13

        
So I will not do a group because I have no rhythm. I can’t do anything like that. (M, 41)It’s depressing when you don’t see your results, you don’t want to try anymore. (C, 41)

        Focus group participants cited weight loss as the most salient reason to both start and stop a PA. Weight loss was prioritized based on body dissatisfaction and physician advice.
        
I want to lose weight. I don’t like my body. (C, 41)The doctor says, “Well just lose weight, a lot of your symptoms will be fixed.” Wouldn’t it be nice to know how? (M, 42)

      
      
        Relatedness: We are in it together
        Relatedness is the interpersonal dimension, reflecting the extent to which a person feels connected to and accepted by others and has caring relationships.
32

        
I can’t do it on my own. (S, 29)just like family in general or anyone who will just go on that journey with you (M, 41)

        Focus group participants explicitly stated the need for social contact(s) who can relate to or understand PCOS and its physical and mental consequences.
        
just someone who understands what you’re going through and who is someone who is also knowledgeable about PCOS. (C, 41)

        Participants discussed that groups, even groups with all women, were intimidating because they felt less feminine and less of a woman compared to others.
        
They don’t have it (PCOS) so they don’t get it. I compare myself to them and feel less of a woman. I’m big, have all this hair, can’t have a baby. (S, 29)

      
      
        Motivational Strategies: I’ve, like everybody, tried all kinds of different things and I’ve liked some and I’ve not liked some
        Focus group participants listed potential motivational strategies to promote and sustain PA as a healthy lifestyle behavior. For example, one participant stated that coaching (the support) increased her competence, which in turn enabled autonomy to make exercise choices that accommodated limited time and space. Each motivational support caters to one or more psychological needs. For example, the motivational support of people affects the need for relatedness; a service support affects the need for competence; the motivational support of technology mostly affects the need for autonomy, whereas the motivational support of behavioral change strategies affects all three needs. The motivational strategies presented by the focus group are listed in order of importance to the participants and with stated advantages and disadvantages of each in relation to general and PCOS-specific PA barriers (Table 3).

      Discussion
      Women with PCOS encounter general and PCOS-specific exercise barriers. According to SDT, the cultural context of PCOS necessitates meaningful motivational strategies to help meet psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In turn, as needs are met, motivation to engage in PA becomes more intrinsic. The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze PA barriers through the lens of SDT, a motivation theory, and identify motivational strategies that may promote PA initiation and maintenance from the perspective of women with PCOS. The discussion is organized by the three innate SDT psychological needs and then motivational strategies that may promote need satisfaction and increase PA motivation.
      
        Autonomy
        Focus group participants expressed that volitional choice to be physically active followed other priorities, such as family demands. The focus group participants detailed many competing time commitments. Although this is probably true for many people, the women with PCOS desired strategies to best incorporate PA given both life demands (e.g. family) and PCOS-specific needs (e.g. grooming rituals, physical comorbidities). The concept of little to no discretionary time to participate in activities that build social and human capital is referred to as time poverty.
33
 Time poverty encourages unhealthy behaviors, (e.g. buying fast food) which creates a cyclic pattern of defeat or learned helplessness.
33
 Time poverty is not necessarily a mismatch between responsibilities and available hours, but a mental outlook on the value of those hours.
33
 A creative way to “fund time” is changing perspective about the value of time, such as giving time a financial equivalent and then budgeting time and money together.
33

        Focus group participants described responsibilities beyond the traditional definition of paid employment, such as childrearing, caregiving for aging parents, and other family obligations. Women in developed and developing nations spend, respectively, an average of 2 and 3.4 times more hours per day than men on unpaid work shouldering the heaviest burden of cooking, cleaning, and caring for children and the elderly.
34
 This inequitable gender-based allocation of unpaid domestic work, representing “double-duty” for women who enter the workforce, often limits discretionary time for women and promotes self-neglect.
35
 While this finding is not unique to women with PCOS, other researchers reported that women with PCOS more strongly adhere to cultural female gender roles to reclaim a feminine identity.
36

        The systemic oppression of women via gender inequality is accompanied by restrictive gender norms dictating societal female expectations, including the gender-specific ideals permeated about a woman’s presentation and gender performativity.
37
 The focus group participants frequently mentioned hirsutism and obesity as PCOS aspects causing stigma-related stress. Pfister and Romer found similar results when they interviewed Danish women with PCOS, all who perceived their bodies as different from femininity norms.
38
 Negative self-evaluation of bodyweight and shape can lead to low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and social phobia.
39
 More and Phillips also found that body dissatisfaction led to less autonomous regulation among women, which led to less frequent PA.
40
 Lastly, several of the participants in the current study reported lack of autonomy due to physical and mental features imposed by PCOS (e.g. obesity, hidradenitis suppurativa, depressive symptoms). Some conditions could be circumvented by choosing alternative forms of PA. For example, the participant with hidradenitis suppurativa chose swimming versus traditional cardiovascular exercise such as walking to avoid hot environments and thus an aggravating factor of excessive perspiration. Recent meta-analyses indicate that PA can significantly improve psychological well-being among people with depressive symptoms.
8

However, focus group participants stated that depression caused lack of energy and drive to be physically active. Screening for depressive symptoms and providing resources may be an essential first step before prescribing PA as therapeutic management. Longitudinal studies assessing PA and subjective well-being have shown that greater well-being predicts maintained or increased activity over time,
41
 and that changes in leisure-time exercise predict changes in happiness.
42

      
      
        Competence
        Focus group participants relayed clinical encounters and public health messaging that issued absent or confusing directives for weight loss. Clinical guidance for weight loss often excludes accurate and more detailed information about the role of exercise for weight loss as PA alone will not produce quick weight loss.
43
 PA enhances the ability to lose weight over time but mostly confers metabolic benefits.
44
 Accurate and specific guidance about realistic goal expectations increases knowledge and builds self-efficacy.
        In addition to accurate and detailed information, individuals must experience success with a behavior to build confidence in their actions.
45
 Positive behavioral experiences build self-efficacy, which in turn facilitates perceived competence for the behavior.
45
 Goal reframing is one strategy to establish other expected and more immediate health outcomes such as improved endurance, increased strength, and improved sleep. Recognizing more immediate health outcomes as goals and subsequently meeting those goals increases the likelihood for sustained behavior change.
45
 Positive and informative feedback also increases perceived competence.
46

        Focus group participants reported physicians as a trusted source of information and competent care. However, physicians cite barriers to exercise counseling such as lack of clinical time, limited education about PA dosing, and the absence of a PA counseling protocol.
47

      
      
        Relatedness
        Several studies (correlational, longitudinal, experimental) revealed a strong positive correlation between sense of belongingness and life satisfaction and wellness.
48
 The focus group participants agreed. Focus group participants emphasized the need to be understood in the context of PCOS, which is consistent with previous literature about women with PCOS.
49
 Being socially connected is influential on psychological and emotional well-being and has a significant and positive influence on physical well-being and overall longevity.
50
 As social beings, people strive for social connection to feel accepted and supported and avoid isolation and loneliness. This sentiment was consistent with a series of experiments designed to examine types of social connection, in which people were motivated to perform a task based on “being understood” or “mere belonging.” Being understood was independent of casual acquaintance versus longstanding relationships with family or friends or one individual versus many people.
51
 Thus, strategies to enable relatedness for women with PCOS could include online peer support, a buddy system, or social support groups.
        Focus group participants ranked relatedness as the most important category when discussing motivational strategies to be more physically active. In a cross-sectional study of women with PCOS about PA perceptions, respondents reported a choice not to be physically active due to feelings of rejection, stigma, and isolation from a general lack of understanding from others about PCOS and its impact.
19
 In a similar study to ours, Dalgas et al. found that unmet needs of relatedness led to feelings of isolation and frustration that prohibited PA, especially in group settings.
52
 As the focus group participants discussed, relatedness is enhanced when there is understanding of PCOS specifically followed by consistent support from the source providing true understanding.
        The SDT literature emphasizes conducting a needs analysis to prioritize the psychological needs when designing tailored interventions for most populations.
53
 However, when considering the differential effects of the three psychological needs among women in general, relatedness contributed strongly to autonomy and competence while autonomy and competence did not impact relatedness. As such, behavioral interventions should consider prioritizing relatedness needs to affect all other needs and promote intervention efficacy among women with PCOS.,
      
      
        Interrelatedness of the psychological needs
        The three innate psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are also interrelated, as they each reinforce the other and work synergistically to contribute to overall well-being and promote more intrinsic motivation.
22

        
          Autonomy and competence
          Autonomy facilitates competence. As individuals choose behaviors that align with priorities and interests, they will invest time and effort in those activities or behaviors, leading to the development of competence. Conversely competence can enhance autonomy. As competence for a behavior increases, individuals are more likely to choose that behavior.
        
        
          Autonomy and relatedness
          Autonomy also involves the freedom to choose when and how to engage in social interactions. Voluntary social interactions are more likely to yield more authentic and meaningful connections with others. Perceived social support, especially types such as emotional and appraisal,
54
 can reinforce autonomous choice.
        
        
          Competence and relatedness
          Findings from information management research indicate that competence leads to knowledge sharing,
55
 which can create a sense of contribution to and connection with those receiving informational support.
56
 In turn, relatedness involves a social environment in which individuals can receive feedback, guidance, and support to fuel their competence and create reciprocal giving and mutual reciprocity.
57

        
      
      
        Motivational strategies
        Motivational strategies may serve to help meet one or more psychological needs. For example, a personal trainer (the support) may provide empathetic listening and feedback to meet both relatedness and competence needs. Whereas, a technological device, such as a smartwatch, may promote and individual to engage in PA through daily activity recording and self-competition, thus meeting the need of autonomy. Behavioral change strategies, such as proper goal setting, meet all three psychosocial needs, as a woman with PCOS must first choose a behavior (autonomy) which she feels confident to perform (competence) and then find one or more people or norms, or benchmarks for which to “compete” or compare (relatedness). The importance of relatedness for engaging in PA superseded autonomy and competence for this sample of women with PCOS. Focus group participants explicitly stated that they sought encouragement from strategies such as tips and success stories about PA and were more motivated by the support of people who had experiential or factual PCOS knowledge.
        Self-awareness is critical while traversing the dynamic life course.
58
 Behavioral self-regulation is the capacity to assess cognitive, affective, and/or behavioral responses to daily life in the context of a larger goal and adapt accordingly.
59
 Thus, motivational strategies may need to change or coexist to match life’s demands. For example, a woman with PCOS may benefit from a coach to enable competence and a technological device to promote accountability. The capacity to self-regulate and appropriately choose alternative motivational strategies are teachable skills. These skills could be taught by healthcare professionals, such as nurses or other ancillary staff.
      
      
        Implications for PA interventions and healthcare
        The findings of this qualitative study highlight implications for PA interventions for women with PCOS. SDT can be a suitable theory to underpin PA interventions to increase motivation for PA by recognizing the context of PCOS and including strategies to meet the women’s psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Developers of PA interventions, specifically within the health realm, could consider the comprehensive guides to SDT techniques complied by Teixeira et al.
46
 For example, to meet the need for autonomy, women with PCOS can be provided choice of activity and given responsibility to schedule the activity. Strategies to meet the need for competence could include goal setting, positive and process-focused feedback, and extrinsic rewards. The need for relatedness could include individual and/or group-level social support from peers with PCOS or healthcare professionals knowledgeable about PCOS. Such social support systems can provide women with PCOS understanding from others while avoiding stigma-related stress due to appearance.
        Healthcare professionals, as a trusted source of information, have a role in promoting PA to women with PCOS. They are in a unique position to recognize and reinforce healthy behaviors and the additional health-related outcomes from PA. Available resources, such as the “Exercise is Medicine,” an initiative launched by the American College of Sports Medicine in 2007, are available to healthcare providers. These resources include PA counseling scripts and PA protocols, thus enabling healthcare providers to prescribe PA as part of a treatment plan.
60
 One resource of the “Exercise is Medicine” initiative is the “PA level as a vital sign” strategy and form (https://www.exerciseismedicine.org/).
60
 Assessing PA as a vital sign at clinic visits could increase the value of PA among clinicians, encourage counseling about positive PA outcome expectations, and confirm the patients’ knowledge and efforts.
        Interventions that meet the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in PA for women with PCOS can lead to more autonomous motivation to be physically active. PA, performed regularly over time, will promote health outcomes by helping to manage PCOS symptoms and mitigating the risk of cardiometabolic health conditions.
      
      
        Limitations
        A limitation of this study was the small sample size of volunteer participants, which limits generalizability. Our recruitment goal was for 6–10 individuals to keep the group size manageable and the participants comfortable sharing their expertise while also achieving diversity of opinion. Additionally, the homogeneity the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics limits generalizability to the entire population of premenopausal women with PCOS. However, the statistics for demographics, PA, and body mass index matched those found in other U.S. studies of premenopausal women with PCOS, except for depressive symptomology. The participants, as a group, were categorized as having mild depressive symptomology compared to moderate in another U.S. PCOS study.
61
 Thus, the volunteer participants for this focus group may have been more motivated to meet and discuss PA and therefore may not be representative of the PCOS population. While the PHQ-8 scores were better than those in other U.S. studies involving women with PCOS, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic affected the responses to the depressive symptom screening tool. None of the focus group participants were teenagers or women of peri-postmenopausal age or residing in other countries, further limiting generalizability to all women with PCOS. Some focus group participants (n = 3) were recruited from other PCOS studies, which can introduce bias, as these participants may be more interested in research. None of the participants reported meeting the guidelines for PA; however, they may have been more interested in PA as compared to the population of U.S. women with PCOS. A limitation was the lack of a validated tool to measure PA status among the participants. Due to COVID-19, meetings were held virtually. This was a strength as women from different geographic locations participated. However, one meeting was interrupted with technical challenges of a dropped call and pauses due to poor connectivity. Overall, the virtual platform was convenient and cost-effective, while providing an easier and more secure way to record and transcribe sessions. The data were collected in three virtual meetings, possibly limiting its depth. The interview guide was not pilot tested. The researchers analyzed each transcript immediately after meetings to check for data saturation. Only two researchers iteratively read all transcripts and worked to identify codes and sub-themes. However, a third researcher was available for any variance, and all authors reviewed the themes and supporting evidence.
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      PCOS is a chronic health condition requiring life-long management, and PA is a first-line treatment strategy. Enacting PA requires motivation. The purposes of this qualitative study were to analyze PA barriers through the lens of SDT, a motivation theory, and identify strategies that may promote PA initiation and maintenance among women with PCOS.
      Findings from this study underscored that the cultural context of PCOS can undermine PA behavior. Motivational strategies can help meet the women’s psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness and promote PA adoption and maintenance. Assessments of cultural context and depressive symptoms, followed by skill-building (e.g. choosing alternative PA types and environmental settings), could precede a PA intervention to circumvent PA barriers. Lastly, focus group participants strongly emphasized the need to be understood by those who support their efforts to adopt and maintain PA. All focus group participants agreed that social support from one or more people with factual or experiential PCOS knowledge would enable motivation. Such motivational strategies could include a peer coach, a community support group, or an invested healthcare team to provide accountability and encouragement.

Title: Rationale and design of the GLADE study: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in endometriosis-related pelvic pain

Abstract: AbstractBackgroundPelvic pain secondary to endometriosis is a disabling condition. There are multiple treatments available, with variable endpoints. No prospective controlled studies were carried out evaluating subdermal pellets of gestrinone in this population.MethodsOne hundred participants with documented deep infiltrative endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either gestrinone 85 mg subdermal bioabsorbable pellets or placebo. Both arms will receive levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12). The treatment duration will be 6 months, with baseline, 3 months and 6 months clinical visits. The primary endpoint is a combination of serious adverse events (SAEs) accumulated within 6 months of insertion of the gestrinone or placebo pellet and collected through spontaneous reports and clinical findings. They include death, threat or risk to life, need for hospitalization, prolongation of pre-existing hospitalization, permanent disability or damage, congenital anomaly; or significant medical occurrences such as venous thromboembolism. The primary safety outcome will be the percentage of patients who do not experience SAEs 6 months after randomization. Androgenization, changes in laboratory exams and in pelvic pain intensity as well as quality of life (SF-36 and EHP-30 questionnaires) will be further evaluated. Daily data on uterine bleeding patterns and the use of pain relief medication will be remotely collected using an App. Pharmacokinetics profile of gestrinone pellet will be characterized.ConclusionThis is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics profile of subdermal gestrinone pellets and might inform clinical practice for treating these patients.Administrative InformationGLADE trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05570786). This is an investigator-initiated research supported by Biòs Farmacêutica.

Body: Introduction
      Pelvic pain is a disabling condition for women of reproductive age, negatively impacting their quality of life and work efficiency. Doctors frequently neglect it despite its estimated worldwide prevalence ranging from 5.6 to 26.6 [1,2]. Pelvic pain is considered a symptom of multifactorial origin in which endometriosis is the leading gynecological cause that affects 5–10% of women in their reproductive years. It means around 176 million women with endometriosis worldwide [3].
      Surgical and hormonal treatments with variable endpoints are available and are still considered a significant challenge for medicine. Recommendations from different medical guidelines for managing the disease include surgery or a combination of surgical and pharmacological strategies [4–6]. Hormone therapy includes progestogens, anti-progestogens, combined oral contraceptives, gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists, GnRH antagonists, the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), danazol and aromatase inhibitors. The choice of treatment for endometriosis must consider the severity of the symptoms, extent, and location of the lesions, comorbidities, age, intention to become pregnant, adverse drug events, and contraindications. Surgical treatment is indicated in the case of severe and disabling symptoms without improvement after the pharmacological treatment. However, post-surgery recurrence rate of painful symptoms is 21.5% after 2 year and 40–50% after 5 years of the surgery [4–6]. The direct costs for treatment of endometriosis are significant. The Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in 2021 registered 26,400 medical appointments and 8,000 hospitalizations for endometriosis with limited access to multifunctional teams specialized in endometriosis and longtime waiting for a surgery [7]. In this context, pharmacological treatment for endometriosis is prominent.
      A Cochrane Review about progestagens and anti-progestagens for pain associated with endometriosis showed gestrinone as anti-progestogen (i.e. a substance that prevents cells from making or using progesterone) and one of the first drugs for the treatment of endometriosis and myomas [8]. Gestrinone acts centrally on the hypothalamic pituitary system by suppressing the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Both continuous progestogens and continuous gestrinone are effective therapies for the treatment of painful symptoms associated with endometriosis. There was no overall evidence of a benefit of one oral progestogen over another. However, this conclusion must be treated with caution due to the lack of placebo-controlled studies [8]. The World Endometriosis Society (WES) [5] and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) [6] guidelines discuss the use of gestrinone as a possible medication for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain. Gestrinone should be used for those whom other treatments have proven ineffective despite potential treatment-associated adverse effects [5]. However, there is still a lack of quality evidence from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.
      GLADE (Gestrinone peLlet AnD Endometriosis) Study is a decentralized, patient-centered, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical study to primarily evaluate the safety and tolerability of subdermal gestrinone bioabsorbable pellet in the treatment of pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis. With this study, we hope to advance the knowledge about gestrinone subdermal pellets, their possible side effects, pharmacokinetics profile and their ability to alleviate pain and improve quality of life of women with endometriosis.
      
        Gestrinone compound profile
        
          Physicochemical properties and pharmaceutical formulation
          3-ethyl-17-hydroxy-18,19-dinor-17α-pregna-4,9,11-trien-20-yn-one, known as gestrinone, ethylnorgestrienone or R-2323 is a synthetic derivative of 19-nortestosterone developed in 1960 originally as a contraceptive and has been studied as a treatment for leiomyoma and endometriosis [9]. It is a compound with the molecular formula C21H24O2 and a molecular weight 308.4.14.
        
        
          Mechanism of action
          The mechanism of action of gestrinone is complex and multimediated. It inhibits folliculogenesis and acts on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, preventing the increase in gonadotropins (FSH and LH) in the middle of the ovulatory cycle, causing estrogen inhibition, anovulation, and amenorrhea. It has an affinity for progesterone and estrogen receptors and a low affinity for androgen receptors while at the same time inducing a reduction in the expression of progesterone receptors [10]. It can reduce the production of SHBG (Sex-hormone binding globulin), which causes an increase in blood levels of free testosterone and progesterone, leading to the emergence of their androgenic effects [11].
        
        
          Metabolization and excretion
          After oral administration, gestrinone has a serum half-life of around 24 h, undergoing active hepatic metabolism essentially by hydroxylation, and its metabolic conjugates are eliminated through urine (40–45%) and feces (30–35%) [12].
        
        
          Side effects
          Most of the adverse effects of gestrinone are due to its androgenic activity and include acne, skin and hair seborrhea, mild hirsutism, edema, weight gain, voice changes, androgenetic alopecia, and clitoral hypertrophy. The drug showed an embryotoxic effect on animals, with a risk of androgenization of female fetuses. It reduces HDL concentrations, and it is recommended to monitor cholesterol and liver transaminase levels in hyperlipidemic patients and glucose levels in diabetic patients. Other effects related to inhibition of the pituitary-ovarian axis may include menstrual disorders and amenorrhea, hot flashes, sweating, breast reduction, changes in libido, vaginal dryness, and emotional fluctuations [13].
        
        
          Clinical evidence
          Previous clinical studies evaluating gestrinone and endometriosis are scarce. A study by Diaz et al. (1977) assessed the contraceptive effect of the subdermal gestrinone implant in Chilean women for 12 months, as well as the emergence of possible adverse events. The authors reported a potent inhibitory effect on fertility in patients, which was accompanied by an increase in transaminases and the appearance of acne, headaches, and hirsutism [14].
          Oral treatment with gestrinone (2.5 to 5 mg twice a week) induced improvement in symptoms associated with endometriosis without the need for daily administration of the drug, which is usually required in similar conservative therapies, representing an option for treatment of the disease. Furthermore, patients treated vaginally tend to have fewer androgenic adverse events such as acne, seborrhea, and weight gain than those treated orally [15].
          Worthington et al. (1993) evaluated the effects of oral gestrinone (1.25 and 2.5 mg twice a week for 6 months) on some metabolic parameters of women with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis. The study concluded that the drug was effective in treating the disease without inducing any loss of bone density but caused unfavorable effects on serum lipids and lipoproteins that were reversed 6 months after the end of treatment [16].
          A randomized clinical study involving 43 women with endometriosis compared 6 months of treatment with gestrinone (5 mg per week) or buserelin nasal spray (300 µg every 8 h) with a 5-year follow-up and found that both treatments were effective in remitting endometriosis. There were reports of acne and vascular events such as edema and heaviness in the lower limbs in the group that received gestrinone [17].
          In 1996, The Gestrinone Italian Group Study compared oral treatment with gestrinone and leuprolide acetate for pelvic pain in women with endometriosis in a randomized, double-blind clinical study, concluding that both were equally effective. However, gestrinone did not affect the patient’s bone density despite inducing fluctuations in serum lipid values [18].
          Trials evaluating gestrinone in the form of a gel for vaginal application (Gestrinone Pentravan®) for the treatment of endometriosis have also been carried out and report positive effects of the drug in relieving refractory pain [19].
          Subdermal gestrinone bioabsorbable pellet could be a safe and effective alternative for treating endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and minimize adverse events observed with oral administration.
        
      
      
        Objectives
        
          Primary objective
          To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response.
        
        
          Secondary safety objectives
          To evaluate the potential for androgenization of the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet in women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response.
        
        
          Other exploratory objectives
          To compare the use of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet versus placebo pellet on participant satisfaction, change in pelvic pain intensity, use of pain relief medication, uterine bleeding pattern and quality of life. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of gestrinone will be characterized in a subgroup of participants.
        
      
    
    
      Patients and methods
      The report of this study protocol follow the SPIRIT (standard protocol items: Recommendations for interventional trials) 2013 guidelines [20].
      
        Study design
        The first participant was included on February 25th 2023 and the last patient last visit is estimated for April 2025. The laboratory analysis for measurement of gestrinone plasma levels are undergoing. We will carry a decentralized, patient-centered, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study. The study will be conducted in 7 research centers in Brazil (hospital and clinics).
        The study protocol has several innovations to increase participant recruitment and retention such as the organization of disease awareness campaigns and the participation of a patient representative as member of the Trial Steering Committee. Participant representative provided information about the burden of the disease and the impact of the treatment through a patient perspective that enabled the inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in the study protocol. An App will be used to remotely collect diary registries about uterine bleeding pattern and use of analgesics for pain relief and other adverse events in real time. These protocol innovations are depicted in Figure 1.

            Protocol innovations.
          
          
        
        The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB – Comitê de Ética Hospital Leforte, CAAE: 64457622.5.1001.5485, Approval Number: 5.748.523, Dated: November 9th, 2022). The study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards at all research sites. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before any study procedure is applied. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05570786). The first participant was included on February 25th 2023 and the last patient last visit is estimated for April 2025.
        The study protocol is composed of two stages: 1) Main protocol: randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, N = 100 participants, treatment duration and follow-up: 6 months; 2) Extension-PK (EXT-PK): open-label, N = 15 participants (subgroup of participants who concluded the main protocol and accepted to receive the treatment; follow-up: 6 months. The study design is depicted in Figure 2.

            Study design.
          
          
        
        Participants eligible for the main stage of the study will be randomized into one of the treatment arms:Experimental: Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) and gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet (85 mg)Comparator: Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) Kyleena® levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system and subdermal implant of placebo bioabsorbable pellet
        The insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12, Kyleena®) is necessary as a contraceptive method for all study participants. LNG-IUS (LNG-IUS 12) has been developed for up to 5 years of use with an average release rate of ∼12 μg/24 h over the first year [21]. Clinical assessments will be recorded at recruitment (baseline), 3 and 6 months after pellet insertion. Assessment of the primary outcome will be carried out 6 months after insertion of the gestrinone pellet.
        Participants will be invited to an extension phase (open-label) of the study to provide additional long-term safety data (EXT-PK). A subgroup of 15 participants at the end of 6 months of the main stage of the study who accept to participate in the extension phase will receive an insertion of a gestrinone pellet (85 mg), and the serum concentration of gestrinone will be monitored to characterize its pharmacokinetic profile (PK). Clinical assessments will be recorded at recruitment (baseline), 1, 3 and 6 months after pellet insertion. Blood sampling for PK study will be conducted.
        Bioabsorbable gestrinone pellets are produced and marketed by Biòs Farmacêutica following standardized procedures and current legislation. Pellets containing a placebo will be prepared under the same conditions as those containing the product ingredient. Biòs Farmacêutica will donate all pellets used in this study.
        GLADE is an investigator-initiated project. Biòs Farmacêutica funded the trial but was not involved in the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, writing of the manuscript, or decision to publish. The Trial Steering Committee designed the study protocol and is monitoring the trial’s progress. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first and the last author and revised based on comments from all the authors. No writing assistance was provided.
      
      
        Patients
        The study will enroll 100 women with refractory pain control who underwent surgery for endometriosis at least 3 months ago and who had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of deep infiltrative endometriosis. Eligible participants are women with pelvic pain secondary to endometriosis surgically treated with refractory symptoms, independent of pain intensity. .Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain includes dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, and nonmenstrual pelvic pain.
        Study participants have a medical history of indication for surgery as an option to reduce endometriosis associated-pain after having been failed to standard hormone treatment (combined hormonal contraceptives, progestogens, GnRH agonists or GnRH antagonists). Surgeries were conducted to fully eliminate endometriotic lesions from both the posterior compartment and anterior compartment, as well as from bowel compartment whenever present.

      Study endpoints
      
        Primary safety outcome
        It is a combination of serious adverse events (SAEs) accumulated within 6 months of insertion of the gestrinone or placebo pellet and collected through spontaneous reports and clinical findings. The primary safety outcome will be the percentage of patients who do NOT experience SAEs 6 months after randomization.
        SAEs are unfavorable medical events that result in any of the following outcomes:DeathThreat or risk to lifeNeed for hospitalizationProlongation of pre-existing hospitalizationPermanent disability or damageCongenital anomaly; orSignificant medical occurrences that, based on appropriate medical judgment, may harm the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the other occurrences mentioned. In this study, the occurrence of thromboembolic events (such as, for example, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and transient ischemic attack) was pre-defined as a significant medical occurrence.
      
      
        Secondary safety outcomes [timepoints: pre-pellet insertion assessment, 3 and 6 months after gestrinone or placebo pellet insertion]
        The main secondary safety outcome will be defined as the number of participants who experience androgenization defined by:Hirsutism: defined by Ferriman-Gallwey Score ≥ 8Clitoromegaly: defined by Clitoral index ≥ 35 mm2Acne: defined by the IGA scale (Investigator’s global assessment) grade 5 – severe inflammatory acne dominates the area, and there are many comedones, pustules, papules, and cystic acneAlopecia with sequelae of scalp thinningDeepening of the voice

        Exploratory efficacy endpoints [timepoints: pre-pellet insertion assessment, 3 and/or 6 months after gestrinone or placebo pellet insertion]
        Exploratory efficacy endpoints are defined as:Median participant satisfaction (ranging from 1 to 5, from very satisfied to very dissatisfied) – assessmentMedian intensity of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea assessed by the VAS scaleProportion of participants who used medication to relieve pelvic painMedian number of days that participant used medication to relieve pelvic painChange in uterine bleeding patternProportion of participants with a change in Health-related Quality of Life measured with the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey Form (SF-36)Average change in total score and score for each domain of the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey Form (SF-36)Proportion of participants with changes in the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP- 30 The Endometriosis Health Profile) scoreAverage change in the total score and the score of each domain of the Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP- 30 The Endometriosis Health Profile)
      
      
        Other exploratory outcomes
        The pharmacokinetic profile of gestrinone will be characterized in a subgroup of participants (N = 15). The pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined: area under the curve (AUC(0-∞)), maximum concentration (Cmax), time until reaching maximum concentration (Tmax), and half-life (t1/2).
      
      
        Assessment of outcomes measures
        Outcomes measures will be assessed during each of the three study visits in the main study protocol (randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled stage), including a baseline visit (pre-treatment), a 3-month visit and 6-month visit. A trained team, including a gynecologist, will conduct the study in the outpatient setting in all study centers. Clinical assessments, monitoring of adverse events, evaluation of androgenization (hirsutism, clitoral index, acne, alopecia, and deepening of the voice), as well as pelvic pain intensity and quality of life assessed by SF-36 questionnaire will be evaluated at all the three study visits. Laboratory blood assessment will be conducted at the baseline visit and in the 3-month visit and include: complete blood count, liver and kidney function (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, urea, creatinine, and uric acid), lipid profile (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL) and blood glucose, coagulogram (PT and aPTT), and plasma hormone levels (total testosterone, free testosterone, and SHBG). Quality of life assessment by the EHP-30 questionnaire will be applied at the baseline visit and in the 3-month visit. Data on uterine bleeding pattern and use of medication to relieve pelvic pain will be remotely collected using and electronic diary available at the App used in the study protocol.
        Outcomes measures in the EXT-PK (open-label) will be assessed during each of the four study visits in which clinical evaluation, monitoring of adverse events, evaluation of androgenization, pelvic pain intensity and quality of life by SF-36 questionnaire will be conducted in each of the clinical visits, including baseline (pre-treatment), 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month after the insertion of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet. Blood sampling for PK study will be conducted: pre-insertion of the gestrinone pellet (predose); different times after insertion of the gestrinone pellet: +24h; 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168 days. Data on uterine bleeding pattern and use of medication to relieve pelvic pain will be remotely collected using an electronic diary established to be available at the App established to be used in the study protocol.
      
      
        Study procedures
        Participant-reported outcomes will be collected via the App used in the study protocol: Quality of Life 36-item Form Health Survey (SF-36); endometriosis health profile – Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP-30); diary to record the use of analgesics for pelvic pain and uterine bleeding pattern. On the first visit, access to the App will be provided to the participant; the participant will receive guidance on how to use the App, and baseline data will be collected. Following the study procedure schedule, participants will receive reminders through the App to record outcomes, and telephone contact will be made for those who do not complete the form regularly. At follow-up visits, participants will be retrained if they present difficulties in using it.
      
    
    
      Screening procedures
      
        Gynecological assessment
        A gynecological assessment will be carried out to check the conditions of the female reproductive tract and the suitability for the insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12). Furthermore, menstrual history, hormone use, pregnancy, and fertility history will be collected. A transvaginal ultrasound will be performed to assess the positioning of the device.
      
      
        Treatments
        
          Insertion of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12)
          The LNG-IUS 12 (Kyleena®) must be inserted in an outpatient setting by the investigator following the manufacturer instructions. After carrying out a gynecological examination to check the size and position of the uterus, the cervix should be visualized with the aid of a speculum, and the cervix and the vagina should be cleaned with an antiseptic solution. With the help of the sliding guide, the IUS inserter must be pushed to the bottom of the uterus to position the device.
        
        
          Insertion of the investigational product or subdermal bioabsorbable placebo pellet
          The investigator will conduct the procedure in an outpatient setting. After local anesthesia, a small incision (4–5 mm) will be made, through which the pellet will be inserted under the skin of the buttock using a trocar. It will be performed just after the insertion of the LNG-IUS 12, and the randomization procedure.
        
      
      
        Safety and efficacy endpoint assessments
        Suspected events and outcomes must be analyzed by the Clinical Events Classification Committee. Safety results should be indicated on the eCRF clinical status page and should be submitted for review.
      
      
        Laboratory evaluation
        Blood samples (total volume of 10 mL) will be collected through venipuncture from the participant in the following tubes: tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant to perform the blood count, tubes with separating gel (to evaluate biochemical parameters of liver and kidney function, hormonal and lipid profile) or citrate (to perform a coagulogram), observing a prior 8-hour fast. After separating the serum, dosages will be carried out using commercially available kits following the instructions specified by the manufacturer. The local laboratory will conduct the analyses using its protocols and equipment and following Biosafety Standards and Good Laboratory Practices.
      
    
    
      Assessment of androgenization
      
        Hirsutism
        The investigator will assess the degree of hirsutism. The participant should be instructed to suspend hair removal/waxing for approximately 14 days before each visit. The use of lasers for hair removal will not be permitted during the entire study period. To evaluate and quantify hirsutism, the modified Ferriman-Gallwey Scoring System will be used, which includes 9 body regions (excluding the legs and armpits) for access to hair growth, grading from 0 (no terminal hair growth) to 4 (extensive hair growth) in 9 locations. The total score ranges from 0 to 36, with a score greater than 8 considered a sign of androgen excess in Caucasian women. A score of 8 – 15 indicates mild hirsutism; above 15, moderate to severe hirsutism. For other ethnic groups, the amount of hair expected for each specific ethnicity must be considered [22].
      
      
        Clitoris measurement
        The investigator will measure the participant’s clitoris (portion corresponding to the glans) [23]. The size of the clitoris will be measured using a 15 cm plastic ruler. The Clitoridean Index will be considered as the product of the longitudinal diameter (in millimeters) x transverse diameter (in millimeters), considering clitoromegaly when these measurements are more significant than 6.5 and 4.4 respectively, and the Clitoridean Index greater than 35 mm2 [24]. Additionally, the participant’s clitoris corresponding to the part of glans + corpus will be measured and registered.
      
      
        Deepening of the voice
        A speech therapist will evaluate the participant’s vocal pattern using protocols and equipment validated by evaluating professionals. The participant’s voice will be recorded using a digital recorder for evaluation. The pattern observed on each visit will always be compared with that recorded during the initial visit (Basal) to detect possible vocal changes and, more specifically, the deepening of the voice.
      
      
        Assessment of the degree of acne
        The severity of acne will be assessed
        By using the IGA scale (Investigator’s global assessment) to be used by the trained researcher and described below:0 – Clear skin: no evidence of acne1 – Almost clear skin: some inflammatory lesions and some non-inflamed papules present (developing papules, without redness yet)2 – Moderately severe acne: some non-inflammatory lesions dominate the area with some pustules and papules (there are no cystic lesions)3 – Non-inflammatory acne dominates the area, and some inflammatory lesions can be found. There may or may not be a small cystic lesion in the area,4 – Inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions are more visible. There may or may not be some cystic acne lesions.5 – Severe inflammatory acne dominates the area. Many comedones, pustules, papules, and cystic acne will be present.
      
    
    
      Alopecia
      The investigator will assess the occurrence of alopecia according to the presence of rarefaction sequelae on the scalp.
      
        Uterine bleeding or bleeding-free days
        The participant must record in the electronic diary (App) whether there has been uterine bleeding in the last 24 h. If the answer is positive, she must inform us of the intensity of the bleeding (whether spotting or bleeding). Based on the data documented in the participant’s diary, the following parameters will be evaluated:Total number of days of amenorrheaTotal number of bleeding-free days in the reference periodTotal number of days of bleeding and spotting (escape)Total number of days with bleeding or spotting in the reference periodNumber of consecutive bleeding-free daysNumber of consecutive days without bleeding after starting treatmentTotal number of days with spotting (escape)Total number of days with spotting (escape) in the reference periodTotal number of days to cessation of bleeding after starting treatment
        The bleeding pattern will be classified according to the criteria of Belsey [25] described below: normal bleeding − 3 to 5 episodes of spotting or bleeding within 90 days; prolonged bleeding – more than 14 days of continuous spotting or bleeding within 90 days; frequent bleeding – more than 14 days of constant spotting or bleeding within 90 days; infrequent bleeding – less than 3 episodes of spotting or bleeding within 90 days; amenorrhea – no bleeding during the 90 days of the reference period.
      
      
        Assessment of changes in the intensity of pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea based on the Visual Analogue scale (VAS/EVA)
        The study participants will receive a diagram based on the Visual Analogue Scale shown below to assess chronic non-cyclical pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea. The VAS scale is standardized from 0 (no pain) to 10 (in centimeters) (the worst pain imaginable).
      
      
        Record of pre-study and concomitant medications
        At the screening visit, pre-study medication use will be recorded. The participant must record in the electronic diary through the App used in the study about the use of concomitant medications, especially for pain relief (analgesics).
      
      
        Assessment of patient-reported quality of life
        The Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Form Health Survey (SF-36) measured health-related quality of life. Participants must respond to the SF-36 questionnaire. The SF-36 is a multidimensional questionnaire containing 36 items distributed into 8 components: functional capacity, physical aspects, pain, general health status, vitality, social and emotional aspects, and mental health. It has a final score that ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to the worst general health status and 100 to the best health status [26].
      
    
    
      Endometriosis health profile 30 (EHP-30)
      Participants must respond to the EHP-30 questionnaire. The EHP-30 is a self-report instrument that measures how endometriosis affects a woman’s health status and quality of life. It consists of a central questionnaire composed of 30 items that access 5 dimensions: pain, control and helplessness, emotional well-being, social support, and self-image; and a modular questionnaire with 23 items distributed across 6 scales: sexual relations, work, medical profession, infertility, relationship with children and treatment. Each scale is transformed into a score from 0 to 100, with the lowest score meaning a better quality of life [27].
      
        Patient satisfaction with treatment
        Participants must rate their satisfaction with the treatment by choosing one of the following alternatives presented in written form (ranging from 1 to 5): very satisfied, satisfied, not sure, dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied.
      
      
        Pharmacokinetic profile of gestrinone
        Blood sampling will be conducted at pre-insertion of the gestrinone pellet; different times after insertion of the gestrinone pellet: +24h; 7, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84, 112, 140, 168 days
        A sensitive and specific high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated by a local specialized laboratory for the determination of gestrinone in human serum using nomegestrol acetate-d5 as an internal standard. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.05 ng/mL.
        The pharmacokinetic parameters will be evaluated: area under the curve (AUC(0-∞)), maximum concentration (Cmax), time until reaching maximum concentration (Tmax), and half-life (t1/2).
      
      
        Reports of pregnancy
        Participants should be instructed to notify the investigator immediately if they become pregnant during the study. The investigator must report any pregnancy in study participants that occurs within 30 days of the last administration of the investigational product.
      
      
        Randomization and allocation concealment
        Participants will be randomized into one of the study arms in a 1:1 ratio to receive treatment with gestrinone or placebo, stratified by center. According to an electronically predefined randomization list, participants will be assigned to a treatment group (RedCap, version 11.0.3). Participants are randomly allocated to one of the study arms, and neither the investigator nor the study participants influence the allocation of participants to the groups (blinding).
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Statistical analysis will be carried out by researchers independently. Summaries by treatment group will be provided using appropriate descriptive statistics for all study variables. Descriptive statistics such as mean ± standard deviation median (minimum-maximum) will summarize continuous variables. Categorical variables will be summarized as the proportions of each category. Graphical data presentation can also be used to summarize data. The values of the scores and indices will be compared with the baseline values (baseline = pre-treatment) using the paired t-test and Wilcoxon test. Changes in laboratory measurements and other secondary outcomes will be compared with the paired Wilcoxon test. Unless otherwise indicated, all statistical tests will be interpreted at a nominal (i.e. no multiplicity adjustment) two-tailed significance level of 0.05 and all CIs at a nominal two-tailed 95% level. The safety and exploratory efficacy outcomes results will be used for analyses.
        The Intention-To-Treat (ITT) and Per Protocol (PP) population will assess all safety and exploratory efficacy endpoints. The ITT population consists of all randomized participants who received the subdermal implant. The PP population includes only participants who complete all research procedures and do not present significant protocol violations, including breach of inclusion criteria.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      Pelvic pain is of multifactorial origin, in which endometriosis is the leading cause. It is challenging to treat endometriosis and there are surgical and hormonal treatments available with variable endpoints. Post-surgery recurrence rate of painful symptoms is high and alternative hormonal methods are needed. Gestrinone is one of the clinical options to reduce endometriosis-associated pelvic pain, but data from clinical controlled trials, particularly with subcutaneous pellets, are scarce.
      This will be the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to compare the safety of gestrinone subdermal bioabsorbable pellet versus placebo in women with endometriosis who underwent surgery without satisfactory response. This is the first to thoroughly evaluate the possible benefits of such a novel gestrinone pharmaceutical formulation with low-dose levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS 12) and might improve clinical outcomes in this population.
      The study protocol has several innovations such as the participation of a patient representative as member of the Trial Steering Committee. Participant representative provided information about the burden of the disease and the impact of the treatment through a patient perspective that enabled the inclusion of patient-reported outcomes in the study protocol. The trial will use advanced technology for data collection to capture participant′s responses, as well as clinical and biological data. In addition, the study includes a variety of biochemical analyses, including an extension phase that will provide crucial information on the long-term use of gestrinone pellets and PK analyses by LC-MS/MS.
      Since it is a safety-focused study, the trial has an experienced and independent Data Safety Monitoring Board and Clinical Events Classification Committee to evaluate all possible events blindly.
      We acknowledge some limitations of the study. Given the possible 10% dropout rate, the sample size might be small. However, given that it is a safety-focused phase II study, results might serve as a basis for large clinical trials powered enough to conclude the safety and efficacy of gestrinone pellets in patients with pelvic pain due to endometriosis. Another limitation of the GLADE trial was not excluding concomitant adenomyosis at screening. There is a need for future studies to evaluate the efficacy of gestrinone with more precise endometriosis phenotype including concomitant adenomyosis.
      In addition, the target population of GLADE trial is women with endometriosis-associated pelvic pain refractory to surgical treatment, independent of the surgical approach. The potential heterogeneity concerning surgical approaches, preferences and techniques performed at multiple Brazilian centers of expertise in endometriosis will be equilibrated between treatment groups by electronic randomization. Further larger studies addressing the efficacy of subdermal pellet of gestrinone and the potential differences of this effect on anterior, posterior or bowel compartment as well as on adenomyosis would bring evidence of a therapeutic option for pelvic pain.
    
    
      Conclusion
      Gestrinone is used for the treatment of pain in women with endometriosis. Still, there is a lack of data from well-designed randomized clinical trials evaluating such a strategy using a subdermal pellet with a particular focus on safety. We expect the current study will provide high-quality evidence of therapeutic efficacy and foster future studies to further characterize subdermal pellets of gestrinone as a therapeutic option for endometriosis-related pelvic pain.

Title: Dysprosium, cerium, indium, yttrium, and lutetium as emerging contributors to oxidative stress in polycystic ovary syndrome

Abstract: To investigate the role of Dysprosium (Dy), Cerium (Ce), Indium (In), Yttrium (Y), and Lutetium (Lu) in relation to oxidative stress (OS) and their potential alterations in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) females. This case-control study included two groups: Healthy controls (50) and PCOS cases (56). Serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu were quantified using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). OS was evaluated by measuring serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation was performed to investigate the correlation between rare earth elements (REEs) and OS markers and differences in correlation strength between the PCOS and control groups were assessed using Fisher’s z-test. PCOS subjects exhibited markedly higher concentrations of Dy, Ce, In, and Y than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The analysis of OS biomarkers revealed elevated MDA levels in the PCOS group, indicating enhanced lipid peroxidation, alongside significantly reduced antioxidant capacity (GSH and SOD) (P < 0.001). Pearson’s correlation demonstrated significant positive associations between higher Dy, Ce, and Y levels and increased MDA levels (P < 0.05). Additionally, a significant negative correlation was observed between In and Y and the antioxidant markers GSH and SOD (P < 0.05), with Ce also showing an inverse association with SOD (P < 0.05). Fisher’s z-test further confirmed significant differences in correlation strength between the PCOS and control groups for Dy-MDA (z = 2.01, P = 0.031), Ce-MDA (z = 1.78, P = 0.037), In-GSH (z = − 2.24, P = 0.025), and In-SOD (z = − 2.39, P = 0.017). Moreover, significant correlations were found between Dy and Y (r = 0.41, P = 0.003), Ce and In (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), Ce and Y (r = 0.53, P < 0.001), and In and Y (r = 0.70, P < 0.001), suggesting interconnected roles of Dy, Ce, In, and Y in PCOS. These findings point to a potential link between OS and REE exposure in the development of PCOS. They suggest that metal-induced oxidative damage could be a key contributor to its pathophysiology. The study underscores the need for deeper investigation into environmental factors affecting reproductive health and for identifying strategies to mitigate these risks in women with PCOS.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-10468-2.

Body: Introduction
      With the surge in technological and industrial progress, women’s health faces unprecedented challenges. The extensive use of metallic compounds in agriculture and domestic spheres has intensified exposure to various elements, raising significant concerns about their impact, especially on reproductive health. Rare earth elements (REEs), often known as ‘technology elements,’ are vital to the advancement of numerous high-tech fields, including consumer electronics (e.g., smartphones and computers) and sustainable energy technologies1–3. Although their distinctive chemical characteristics render them critical for such applications, growing environmental accumulation of REEs has raised concerns regarding their potential effects on human health, particularly in relation to reproductive disorders like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Environmentally, growing extraction, use, and disposal of these elements have led to their accumulation, with human activities contributing to their buildup in soil and water systems4–7. Human exposure to REEs is elevated due to their high mobility and ion-emitting properties, which allow them to easily enter ecosystems, accumulate in the food chain, and increase environmental exposure. As “emerging pollutants,” these elements remain largely unregulated, with limited monitoring and insufficient understanding of their toxic effects. Concerns about the health impacts of REEs are growing, particularly regarding their effects on reproductive health, including fertility and pregnancy outcomes8–11. Although studies on its reproductive toxicity are limited, evidence from animal models indicates that elevated doses may disrupt ovarian function and lead to embryotoxic effects. The adverse effects of REEs on reproductive function have been investigated in sea urchins, where exposure was shown to impair fertilization, disrupt redox balance, interfere with embryonic development, and alter the regulation of genes involved in embryogenesis12. Notably, some human studies have documented an increased risk of preeclampsia, neural tube defects, adverse IVF outcomes, spontaneous abortion, and premature membrane rupture with higher maternal REE levels13–16. More recently, an increased risk of pregnancy loss has been reported in women with miscarriage owing to increase in serum REE9–11. Metals like Dysprosium (Dy), Cerium (Ce), Indium (In), and yttrium (Y) and Lutetium (Lu), may pose a significant risk to reproductive health, due to their widespread use in modern technologies and potential toxicity1,17–19. A recent case–control study reported higher heavy metals in women with PCOS compared to controls, linking these alterations to metabolic dysfunction and environmental exposures19.
      PCOS is a complex endocrine disorder and a major cause of infertility in women globally17. The condition presents with irregular ovulation, excess androgens, and polycystic ovaries, though its underlying causes remain poorly understood20–22. While the etiology of PCOS is multifactorial, recent evidence suggests that environmental factors, including exposure to heavy metals and REEs, may contribute to its development23–25, however, underlying etiologies remain unclear. Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu are REEs that may have potential impacts on reproductive health. Presumably, they could induce oxidative stress (OS), and alter redox balance, potentially exacerbating conditions associated with PCOS13,26–28. Increased levels of these REEs can interfere with hormonal balance, affect ovarian function, and impair fertility. Oxidative damage resulting from REE exposure may alter reproductive processes like oocyte maturation and impair follicle development in the case of PCOS. While the full extent of their impact on human reproductive health remains under investigation, emerging research suggests that exposure to these REEs may contribute to reproductive toxicity and conditions such as infertility and PCOS. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to examine serum levels of selected rare earth elements - Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu in patients with PCOS. It seeks to explore the correlation between these elements and markers of OS, comparing PCOS patients with fertile controls. The reprotoxic effects of these five REEs are scarcely documented in pregnancy-related research involving humans, making them the subject of our study. By shedding light on these relationships, this research aims to provide new insights into how REEs may contribute to the development and progression of PCOS. The findings could have far-reaching implications for developing diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies, offering a deeper understanding of how environmental pollutants influence reproductive health and paving the way for targeted interventions. The study thus aims to estimate the serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu in women with PCOS and to assess the correlation between these REE levels and oxidative stress markers in PCOS patients compared to fertile controls.
    
    
      Result
      
        Participant characteristics
        This study revealed notable differences between women with PCOS and controls across clinical, and biochemical parameters. Among the participants, 52.8% were women with PCOS, while 47.1% served as controls. Sociodemographic characteristics showed no statistically significant variation across the study groups, as demonstrated by data from our prior study29. However, clinical features such as irregular menses (56%) and acne (60%) were significantly more prevalent among women with PCOS (P < 0.01).
      
      
        Biochemical profile and OS markers
        Biochemical assessments showed that fasting blood sugar (FBS) and HbA1c levels were markedly higher in the PCOS group than in controls (P < 0.001). Similarly, PCOS group exhibited significantly higher luteinizing hormone (LH) levels accompanied by increased triglyceride (TG) concentrations at P < 0.001 and P < 0.05 respectively (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). PCOS group exhibited a notable increase in MDA levels, a marker of lipid peroxidation, compared to controls (P < 0.001). Conversely, antioxidant markers such as GSH and SOD were significantly reduced in women with PCOS (P < 0.001).
      
      
         Rare Earth element levels
        REE levels differed significantly across the groups analyzed. Serum levels of Dy, was significantly higher in the PCOS group than in controls (P < 0.001), along with elevated levels of Ce, In, and Y, which were significant at P < 0.05. However, the levels of Lu remain insignificant between the two groups (Table 1).
      
      
        Correlation analysis between REEs and OS markers
        To assess the link between elevated REE levels and OS markers, Pearson’s correlation analysis was carried out (Table 2). In the control group, no significant associations were detected between REEs and OS markers. However, distinct patterns emerged in the PCOS group: (a) for MDA, positive correlations were observed with Dy (r = 0.29, p = 0.04), Ce (r = 0.30, P = 0.03), and Y (r = 0.33, P = 0.02) in PCOS subjects, while correlations in controls were weaker and nonsignificant. Fisher’s z-test indicated significant differences between groups for Dy (z = 2.01, P = 0.031), Ce (z = 1.78, P = 0.037), and Y (z = 1.90, P = 0.049) and (b) antioxidant Status: In and Y exhibited negative correlations with antioxidant markers-GSH and SOD (P < 0.05). GSH correlated negatively with In (r = − 0.30, P = 0.034), with a significant between-group difference (z = − 2.24, P = 0.025). SOD showed significant negative correlations with Ce (r = − 0.33, P = 0.02) and In (r = − 0.31, p = 0.02), with Fisher’s z-tests confirming significant between-group differences (z = − 1.90, P = 0.049; z = − 2.39, P = 0.017, respectively). These findings suggest altered associations between REEs and OS markers in PCOS compared to controls. In multiple testing correction, the raw P-values for markers (MDA, SOD, GSH, Dy) ranged from 0.000013 to 0.00042, indicating significant differences between PCOS cases and controls. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, markers with P-values < 0.00013 remained statistically significant. The Benjamini-Hochberg correction/False Discovery Rate (FDR) identified additional significant markers with P-values up to 0.045 (Supplementary Table 3). MDA and Dy remained significant after both Bonferroni and FDR corrections, showing strong associations. SOD and GSH were significant after FDR but only partially after Bonferroni correction. Lu was not significant by either method. Ce, In, and Y were significant only after FDR correction. This indicates that FDR correction might be better suited for detecting relevant findings in this exploratory study. The correlations that remain significant after multiple testing correction—especially after FDR adjustment can be considered statistically meaningful within the exploratory context of the study. Correlation plots for these relationships in PCOS cases are provided in Figs. 1, 2 and 3.

        Inter-Element relationships
        Table 3 displays the inter-element correlation analysis of REEs in the PCOS group. Y exhibited strong significant positive correlations with Ce (r = 0.53, P < 0.001), and In (r = 0.70, P < 0.001). Additionally, Y demonstrated a moderate positive correlation with Dy (r = 0.41, P = 0.003). Further, a strong positive correlation was observed between In and Ce (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), suggesting a notable relationship between these elements. Lu showed no significant correlations with other elements in the study, indicating weaker relationships in comparison to other pairs. In summary, significant positive correlations were primarily observed between Yttrium (Y), Indium (In), and Cerium (Ce), while the other element combinations showed weak or no significant relationships.

      Discussion
      The findings of this study uncover a critical link between REEs and PCOS, highlighting their potential role in disrupting redox balance and contributing to OS. Women with PCOS exhibited significantly elevated serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, and Y compared to healthy controls, alongside reduced antioxidant defenses and a shift toward oxidative dominance. These results emphasize the impact of environmental exposure to REEs on reproductive health and suggest OS-induced metal toxicity as a key factor in the pathophysiology of PCOS.
      This study provides a new perspective on the environmental and biochemical influences underlying PCOS. REEs, commonly used in various industrial applications have garnered attention for their potential health impacts. However, the toxicity and biological effects of REEs on human reproductive health have been poorly studied, particularly in conditions such as PCOS. This study suggests that environmental exposure to REEs may exacerbate OS, contributing to the reproductive challenges observed in PCOS. Among the REE-Lutetium (Lu), dysprosium (Dy), cerium (Ce), indium (In), and yttrium (Y) play essential roles in modern technologies. Lutetium is primarily used in high-performance catalysts for petroleum refining and nuclear medicine for cancer treatment30. Dysprosium is crucial in the production of high-performance permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and electronics, and also finds applications in lasers and nuclear reactors31. Cerium, being the most abundant REE, is used in catalytic converters for automobiles to reduce emissions, in glass polishing, and the manufacturing of batteries and fuel cells32. Indium, typically extracted from zinc ores, is widely used in the production of thin-film photovoltaic cells, LCDs, and semiconductors, as well as in solders and alloys33. Yttrium, though relatively abundant among REEs, is essential in producing phosphors for displays, superconductors, lasers, and cancer treatments. These elements are extracted from minerals like bastnasite and monazite and have become critical components in technologies such as electronics, renewable energy systems, and environmental applications34. The growing use of REEs has resulted in their accumulation in soil and water, raising concerns about environmental and health risks, particularly regarding their effects on reproduction and pregnancy35,36. High doses of In have been shown to impair ovarian function and exhibit embryotoxic effects in animal studies37. Yttrium has also been reported to accumulate in reproductive tissues, which may interfere with normal reproductive processes; however, its human health impact remains uncertain38. Elevated serum REE levels have also been linked to adverse reproductive outcomes, including poor in vitro fertilization success, spontaneous abortion, and premature membrane rupture39. These effects highlight the distinct cytotoxic profiles of individual REEs across species and underscore the variability in their toxicological impacts.
      This study expands on previous research by examining REEs in women with PCOS and their potential links to OS. Notably, serum levels of Dy, Ce, In, and Y were significantly elevated in the PCOS cases relative to controls at P < 0.05. These elevated REE levels were positively associated with increased lipid peroxidation, as indicated by higher MDA levels (P < 0.05), and negatively correlated with reduced antioxidant markers, including SOD and GSH (P < 0.05). The findings of the current study are consistent with previous studies22,40,41. Significant positive correlations between REEs (Dy, Ce, Y) and MDA, along with negative correlations with antioxidants (GSH, SOD), were observed only in PCOS patients. These associations differed significantly from controls, indicating that REEs may specifically contribute to OS in PCOS. This highlights a potential role of REE exposure in the disease’s oxidative pathophysiology. The significant correlations between REEs in the PCOS group: Dy and Y (r = 0.41, P = 0.003), Ce and In (r = 0.41, P = 0.002), Ce and Y (r = 0.53, P = 0.0006), and In and Y (r = 0.70, P = 0.0001, further suggests interconnected roles of Dy, Ce, In, and Y in PCOS. Our findings demonstrate significant alterations in OS markers in PCOS cases compared to controls. The use of multiple testing corrections ensured that the reported associations are unlikely to be false positives. The Bonferroni correction, while conservative, confirmed the strongest associations (MDA, Dy), whereas the Benjamini-Hochberg method allowed for the detection of additional markers (Ce, In, Y) that may be biologically relevant. Overall, correcting for multiple testing ensured the reliability of the findings, with both conservative and liberal approaches highlighting key differences in oxidative and elemental profiles of PCOS patients versus controls.
      Despite decades of research, the precise pathogenesis of PCOS remains elusive. While its underlying causes are still being investigated, emerging evidence highlights OS as a critical factor in its development. The augmented OS in PCOS can be traced back to several sources. This study postulates that exposure to REEs such as Dy, Ce, In, and Y may contribute to the onset or progression of PCOS through OS-mediated mechanisms. REEs are known to induce OS by disrupting the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and antioxidant defense systems42. Elevated OS has been documented in the follicular fluid and serum of women with PCOS, highlighting their significant contribution to the pathophysiology of the condition23. Among these biomarkers, malondialdehyde (MDA), a stable end-product of lipid peroxidation has proven to be a reliable indicator of oxidative damage. Studies have reported a 47% increase in circulating MDA levels in women with PCOS compared to controls, underscoring the role of lipid peroxidation in the metabolic and reproductive dysfunctions characteristic of the disorder43,44.
      Cells defend against free radical damage using antioxidant systems, including enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. Of prime importance, Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is a key enzyme that neutralizes ROS by converting superoxide anions (O₂⁻) into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). There is conflicting evidence regarding SOD levels in PCOS, with some studies reporting elevated levels, while others have found decreased activity in serum and follicular fluid45,46. Increased SOD activity protects against OS-induced damage, while decreased activity can lead to apoptosis and corpus luteum regression41. These interactions emphasize the importance of SOD in ovarian function and reproductive health. Imbalances between antioxidants and ROS in follicular fluid can impair oocyte quality, potentially causing abnormal ovulation and infertility, as observed in PCOS patients42. Another key molecule in defending against OS is Glutathione (GSH), a major non-enzymatic antioxidant crucial for neutralizing oxidants and maintaining cellular redox balance. In PCOS, GSH depletion is likely due to elevated oxidants47,48. Presumably, heavy metals exacerbate this depletion by binding to GSH’s sulfhydryl (-SH) groups, forming organo-metallic complexes that disrupt their antioxidant function and further impair cellular defense mechanisms49,50. The OS in PCOS cases observed in the current study aligns with previous evidences. REE exposure in sea urchins led to a marked increase in OS, along with impaired fertilization outcomes and increased developmental defects in offspring as reviewed by Martino et al..,202212. Likewise, studies on algae, including common cyanobacteria, have revealed that Yttrium exposure impairs the antioxidant defense system, leading to increased OS51. More recently, elevated levels of similar elements and impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms in PCOS patients have also been reported18,19,50. Together, these studies highlight the role of REEs in amplifying OS, potentially influencing reproductive health outcomes like those observed in PCOS.
      As reported in previous studies, elevated OS significantly compromises oocyte quality by inducing lipid peroxidation, which impairs maturation and increases the prevalence of immature oocyte25. Moreover, OS disrupts granulosa cell function, which is critical for follicular growth and steroid hormone production, resulting in anovulation, a hallmark of infertility in PCOS43. These disruptions not only impair follicle maturation but also alter the endometrial environment, further intensifying reproductive challenges in women with PCOS. In summary, REEs may worsen PCOS by triggering OS, disturbing endocrine function, and hindering follicle development, all of which contribute to the onset or exacerbation of the condition. To better understand the mechanistic role of REEs in PCOS pathophysiology, future studies should focus on both in vitro and in vivo models. Cellular experiments using ovarian granulosa cells or theca cells could investigate how exposure to elevated REEs affects oxidative stress pathways, mitochondrial function, and steroidogenesis, key processes altered in PCOS. Assessing changes in ROS generation, antioxidant enzyme activity, and expression of genes regulating inflammation and hormone synthesis would clarify direct cellular effects. Animal models of PCOS could be used to evaluate systemic impacts of REE exposure on reproductive and metabolic phenotypes, including hormonal profiles, follicular development, and insulin resistance. Additionally, exploring potential REE-induced epigenetic modifications might uncover long-term regulatory changes contributing to PCOS progression. Human studies incorporating longitudinal designs could assess whether environmental or dietary REE exposure correlates with PCOS onset or severity. Integrating multi-omics approaches, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, may reveal downstream molecular networks perturbed by REEs. Together, these approaches would provide comprehensive insight into how REEs influence PCOS development and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
    
    
      Conclusion
      This study highlights the potential role of REE-induced oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of PCOS. The observed trends point to the need for greater awareness of environmental pollutants in reproductive health. These preliminary findings open new avenues for exploring environmental contributors to PCOS and underscore oxidative stress as a potential therapeutic target.
      
        Limitations of the study:
        While this study is among the first to assess associations between REEs and oxidative stress in PCOS, it did not account for environmental or lifestyle confounders (e.g., diet, pollution, occupational or cosmetic exposure) that may influence REE levels and oxidative stress. The Bonferroni correction, while conservative, confirmed the strongest associations (MDA, Dy), whereas the FDR method allowed the detection of additional markers (Ce, In, Y) that may be biologically relevant but require validation. Future studies should explore the clinical implications of these markers and validate the borderline findings.
      
    
    
      Method
      
        Study design and participants
        This case-controlled study involved women aged 19 to 35 years, divided into two groups: Group I, comprising 50 healthy controls, and Group II, consisting of 56 women diagnosed with PCOS. The study recruited participants from the Section of Obstetrics and Gynecology at King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, located in Riyadh. Ethical clearance was granted by the hospital’s Institutional Review Board (IRB), under approval number E-18-3536. All procedures followed the ethical standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to participation, each individual provided written informed consent.
      
      
        Inclusion and exclusion criteria
        
          PCOS Group:
          Women who met at least two of the following criteria were included in the PCOS group: (a) hyperandrogenism, (b) polycystic ovarian morphology, or (c) experiencing oligo- or amenorrhea, characterized by less than 8 menstrual cycles within a 12-month period. These cases were screened based on the Rotterdam criteria52.
        
        
          Control group:
          Healthy females without any symptoms of hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, infertility, or ultrasound findings suggestive of PCOS.
        
        
          Exclusion criteria:
          Patients on lipid-lowering or antihypertensive medications, pregnant women, and those with diabetes, anemia, cancer, infections, thromboembolism, stroke, or ischemic heart disease were excluded.
        
      
      
        Sample collection and baseline characteristics
        Approximately 5 mL of blood was collected from each participant after obtaining written informed consent. The blood was centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm to isolate the serum, which was then stored at −80 °C until further analysis to preserve its integrity. Baseline characteristics were assessed using an autoanalyzer, with the Mediserv 3700/Cell Dyne (STA Compact) and Roche Elecsys 2010 (Modular Analytics E170-Cobas e 411) for relevant tests.
      
      
        Detection of oxidative stress
        
          Lipid peroxidation (Malondialdehyde- MDA assay):
          MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation, were quantified using the MDA Assay Kit (ab118970; Abcam). A standard curve was created with MDA concentrations ranging from 4 to 20 nmol/well or 20–100 µM. The assay measures the formation of MDA-TBA adducts at 532 nm, with a sensitivity of > 0.1 nmol/well. MDA levels were reported in nmol/ml.
        
        
          Antioxidant markers (GSH and SOD):
          Glutathione (GSH) levels and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity were assessed using the Glutathione Assay Kit (CS0260; Sigma) and the SOD Assay Kit- Water-Soluble Tetrazolium salt; WST (19160; Sigma), respectively. In the GSH assay, the formation of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB), resulting from the reduction of 5,5’-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), is monitored by measuring its absorbance at 412 nm, with GSH levels expressed in mg/ml. For SOD activity, absorbance at 450 nm was measured after incubating the samples with Water-Soluble Tetrazolium salt (WST) and enzyme working solutions at 37 °C for 20 min. SOD activity was reported in IU/ml.
        
      
      
        Quantification of REE
        Once thawed, serum samples were centrifuged to remove cells, resulting in clear serum. A volume of one milliliter of sera was diluted with a solution of 0.5% nitric acid and 0.01% Triton X-100 to ensure the elements remained dissolved and stable. Subsequently, levels of Dy, Ce, In, Y, and Lu were measured using the Perkin Elmer NexION 2000G ICP-MS. Certified reference materials (CRMs) with a concentration of 1000 ppm were employed for calibration, and serum metal levels were quantified in parts per billion (ppb). A calibration curve was established with working standards covering 0.025 to 100 ppb. Each standard concentration was measured three times, and a multi-point linear regression was used to correlate signal intensity with concentration. To enhance measurement accuracy and reduce matrix effects, a constant amount of germanium (Ge) was added as an internal standard to all serum samples. The resulting calibration curve exhibited excellent linearity, with a coefficient of determination (R²) exceeding 0.999. LOD values for each element were calculated by assessing the distinction between blank sample signals and background interference, with detection limits as low as 0.025 ppb, reflecting the high sensitivity of the ICP-MS instrument. The method demonstrated strong reliability, with measurement accuracy ranging from 0.3 to 22.8% and precision between 0.8% and 11.8%.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        Data analysis was conducted using Sigma Plot version 12. About 56 PCOS cases and 50 healthy controls were initially recruited; statistical analyses were conducted on 50 participants in each group. Six PCOS samples were excluded due to poor sample quality or missing data, resulting in a final sample size of 100 (50 per group) for all comparisons and correlation analyses. The exact number of data points used in each analysis was consistent. The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed the normality of paired differences, allowing the use of paired t-tests for comparison of measured variables. Pearson’s correlation was performed to examine associations between REEs and OS markers. Differences between correlation coefficients in the PCOS and control groups were assessed using Fisher’s z-transformation followed by a two-tailed z-test. To account for the issue of multiple hypothesis testing, P-values were adjusted using both the Bonferroni correction and the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (FDR). For Bonferroni correction, the significance threshold was set at P < 0.003. For the FDR, adjusted P-values were evaluated at a significant level of 0.05. Scatter plots were used to visualize correlations between REEs, MDA, GSH, and SOD.

Title: The PCOS Phenotypes in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study: participant clinical features and data harmonization on analysis of individual participant data

Abstract: BackgroundPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a multifaceted condition with diagnostic challenges and clinical heterogeneity across populations. Research priorities include enhanced accuracy in defining cut-offs for diagnostic features. Here, we aim to describe participant clinical features and data harmonization in the international PCOS Phenotype in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study.MethodsWe searched EMBASE and Medline (Ovid) from 1990 to October 2, 2020, in population-based, medically unbiased study cohorts. Included studies had ≥ 300 participants, directly assessed PCOS-related features, and provided Individual Participant Data (IPD). Risk of bias was assessed using the AXIS tool. Data integrity was ensured via cross-referencing, identifying outliers/implausible data, and variable harmonization. Reporting follows PRISMA-IPD guidelines, summarizing findings with frequencies and proportions.ResultsThe study included 9979 reproductive-age women from 12 studies across eight countries (China, Iran, Italy, Nigeria, Russia, South Korea, Turkey, and the USA), representing 11 ethnicities. Ovulatory dysfunction was variably recorded, from mean menstrual cycle length, minimum or maximum cycle length, number of cycles per year, or urinary progesterone measurements. Clinical hyperandrogenism was assessed via modified Ferriman–Gallwey (mFG) scores, with a few also including acne and alopecia. Biochemical hyperandrogenism thresholds varied (95th, 97.5th, or 98th percentile of healthy controls). Polycystic ovary morphology was assessed via transvaginal, transabdominal, or transrectal approaches. Harmonization adhered to International PCOS Guidelines for ovulatory dysfunction, ethnicity-specific cut-offs for hirsutism (via k-means clustering), and 95th percentile thresholds for biochemical hyperandrogenism. PCOS prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 19.8% in the original studies and was 11.0% overall after harmonization.ConclusionsThe P-PUP study offers an unprecedented, ethnically diverse, medically unbiased population-based cohort, an extraordinarily valuable tool to enhance knowledge and research in PCOS. However, variability in data collection methods and definitions of PCOS diagnostic features across studies limited the ability to fully integrate data for analysis. Despite these limitations, we optimized harmonization in this IPD, and the findings provided valuable insights into the challenges of data harmonization and established a foundation for future collaborative research. Future research should focus on standardizing data collection, establishing normative cut-offs based on true natural groupings, and linking diagnostic clusters to outcomes in diverse populations.Protocol registrationCRD42021267847.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12916-025-04221-9.

Body: Background
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrinopathy with significant long-term reproductive, metabolic, dermatological, and psychological health impacts [1]. According to the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines criteria, diagnosis in adults is based on the presence of at least two of the following three criteria: (1) oligo-/anovulation (OA); (2) clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism (HA); and (3) either polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasound or elevated serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels [2–5]. In adolescents, the diagnosis requires both OA and HA [2–5]. It is estimated that 10–13% of women worldwide are affected by PCOS, and the global incidence is reportedly increasing, making PCOS a major public health concern [2–6]. PCOS and its associated health implications generate substantive health [7, 8] and economic burdens for individuals, societies, and governments [9–12].

      Despite increasing research and publications on PCOS [13], the pathogenesis remains unclear and there are significant persisting challenges in diagnosis. This is attributable to its multifaceted and heterogeneous clinical presentation, the lack of gold-standard diagnostic tests, ethnic variation, and the fact that most studies are carried out in medically biased (clinically based) populations [14–19]. It is also due to the multiple components of the diagnostic criteria, which are all continuous variables [20–22], the paucity of data on normative cut-off thresholds for each diagnostic component within unselected, diverse populations [23, 24], and the use of arbitrary diagnostic cut-offs across studies [25–31]. This contributes to delayed or inaccurate diagnosis of PCOS, hindering timely and appropriate interventions to limit complications and treat the condition [12, 32–35].
      These challenges underscore the importance of consolidating data from diverse populations for a more comprehensive understanding of the condition [16]. While traditional systematic reviews and meta-analyses represent an improvement over single-center studies, they are limited by aggregated data from original studies with varying methodologies, sample sizes, and study populations. Conversely, the PCOS Phenotype in Unselected Populations (P-PUP) study, is a large-scale, international individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis designed to address identified challenges, allowing harmonization of raw data from individual studies, standardization of cut-offs and analyses across studies and examination of individual-level variables to advance knowledge on PCOS etiology, diagnosis and clinical features in unselected community-based populations [36].
      This report on the P-PUP study aims to (a) outline the selection criteria and study identification process for the study, (b) describe the clinical features of the populations included, and (c) detail the data harmonization process for PCOS diagnostic criteria and features within the study.
    
    
      Methods
      
        Protocol and registration
        The protocol for the P-PUP study was registered in PROSPERO (ID: CRD42021267847) and published previously [36]. This study was reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses of Individual Participant Data guideline [37].
      
      
        Selection of studies
        The methodology for the selection and identification of research groups and collaborators has been described previously [36]. In summary, a systematic search of the EMBASE and Medline (Ovid) databases, along with a manual Google search, was conducted from 1990 to October 2, 2020, to identify eligible unselected population-based cohort studies. Key search terms included PCOS, ovulatory dysfunction (OD), hirsutism, polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM), and unselected populations, among others. A full search strategy for Medline (Ovid) is in Additional file 1: Table S1. The PCOS research community (RA and HJT) was consulted to identify any potentially ongoing or unpublished studies.
        Cross-sectional or longitudinal cohort studies were considered eligible if they were published after 1990 (after a change in diagnostic criteria), included a sample size of 300 or more unselected women of any age, ethnicity, or weight, and directly assessed features related to PCOS [36]. These features of PCOS included measurement of ovulatory dysfunction, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. No language restrictions were imposed. Studies that relied on self-reported or International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for PCOS status without the assessment of PCOS features were excluded. Exclusion criteria at the participant level included pregnant and lactating women, women with natural/surgical menopause, ovarian pathology, and women meeting the criteria for exclusion of other conditions in the diagnosis of PCOS. Additionally, women receiving contraceptive hormonal treatment within 3 months of assessment were excluded from the androgen analysis.
        Titles and abstracts were initially screened by a single reviewer (SK), and then full-text articles were retrieved and assessed in duplicate (SK and ADB) with any discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer (HJT). The corresponding and/or lead authors of the identified studies were contacted and requested to contribute to deidentified IPD for integration and analysis. For authors who did not respond, two reminder emails were sent.
      
      
        Data collection processes
        Data and relevant dictionaries were transferred to the ISO 27001-certified Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) [38] which restricts access and control to the authorized data custodian and researchers. The key variables collected aligned with the PCOS core outcomes set [39] and included sociodemographic factors (age and race/ethnicity); generic outcomes (weight, height, body mass index (BMI)), metabolic outcomes (waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-to-hip ratio, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profiles, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose (FBG)); dermatological (hirsutism as measured by modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG score) and reproductive outcomes (androgen assays, menstrual cycle length, number of menstrual cycles per year, age of menarche, and PCOM features including antral follicle count (AFC) and ovarian volume (OV)). Any data discrepancies or concerns were discussed and resolved with the original study investigators.
      
      
        Risk of bias assessment
        We evaluated the risk of bias in the included studies providing IPD using the AXIS appraisal tool for cross-sectional studies [40]. The appraisal was conducted by two independent reviewers (ADB and RRD), and any discrepancies were resolved through consensus. This tool consists of 20 items that assess various aspects such as the study’s aim, design, sample size, outcome variable measurement, statistical methods, response rate, result consistency, discussion and conclusion, limitations, and ethical approval, with responses categorized as “yes,” “no,” or “don’t know” [41]. Overall quality was rated as low (score 1-7), medium (score 8-14), or high (score 15-20) [41].
      
      
        Data harmonization and analysis
        Data synthesis involved rigorous procedures to ensure data integrity and harmonization across diverse datasets. All laboratory measurements were standardized to the International System of Units (SI) for consistency. Outliers were identified using scatter plots and box plots, applying a criterion where values exceeding > 5 or > 10 standard deviations were flagged [42]. Invalid or implausible data points, such as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) surpassing systolic blood pressure (SBP), and height < 120 cm were identified, based on consensus clinical judgment and predefined criteria. Definitions of outliers, invalid data points, and rules for variable harmonization were documented and collaboratively discussed with original study investigators to achieve consensus on data handling (Additional File 1: Table S4).
        For the harmonized definition of PCOS, we adhered to the International PCOS Guideline criteria, requiring two of three key features: OD, clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. The specific criteria for each feature were defined as follows:◦ OD: Menstrual cycles numbering fewer than eight or exceeding 17 per year, and/or cycle lengths shorter than 21 days or longer than 35 days.◦ Clinical hyperandrogenism: Defined by hirsutism quantified through the modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) scoring system. We analyzed ethnic distribution patterns of mFG scores using descriptive statistics of means and medians. Subsequently, we standardized the data (mean = 0, SD = 1) and performed a k-means cluster analysis (k = 2), with cluster determination guided by the average silhouette method, following our previously published methodology [43].◦ Biochemical hyperandrogenism: Defined using study-specific 95th percentile cut-offs for first-line androgen tests (TT, FT, cFT, and FAI), supplemented by secondary markers (A4 and DHEAS) when first-line tests yielded negative results. This approach accounts for variations in assay methods and reference ranges across studies.◦ Polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM): Given the considerable heterogeneity in imaging modalities, ultrasound approaches, and absence of individual participant data (IPD), harmonization of PCOM data proved unfeasible; thus, we relied on each study's original definitions and categorizations for this criterion.
        This study undertook a one-stage approach for analysis and only included women of reproductive age between 18 and 45 years. Continuous variables were reported as means with standard deviations (SD) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR), as appropriate for the distribution of data. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and proportions. Available case analysis was employed, and we did not opt to undertake multiple imputations for any missing data because they could not be random. Stata 18 software was used for data management and analysis.

        Study characteristics and risk of bias
        The literature search identified 6507 publications, from which 1437 duplicates were removed. After screening the titles and abstracts, 342 studies underwent full-text review of which 313 studies were excluded (Additional File 1: Table S2). Finally, 29 studies met the eligibility criteria and their authors were contacted. Of these, the authors of 19 studies, encompassing 31,580 participants, did not respond. Of the 10 authors who responded, seven expressed willingness to collaborate and completed the data-sharing process, whereas three studies involving a combined total of 17,439 participants were unable to do so [44–46]. Additionally, two ongoing studies were identified through other researchers, and two authors contributed more than one study from different populations. The entire P-PUP study dataset encompassed 12 population-based medically unbiased representative cohorts [26, 31, 47–56] and 12,513 participants drawn from PCOS research groups spanning eight countries internationally (Fig. 1). A detailed assessment of the included studies’ methodological quality appraisal is presented in Additional File 1: Table S3. All of the included studies had a low risk of bias (high quality) [26, 31, 47–56].Fig. 1PRISMA IPD flow diagram for P-PUP study selection
        Table 1 presents the characteristics of the final included studies. The entire P-PUP study dataset included studies from China (n = 2; 4645 women) [48, 52], Iran (n = 3; 2517 women) [49, 53, 54], Italy (n = 1; 519 women) [50], Russia (n = 1; 2695 women), South Korea (n = 1; 499 women) [26], Turkey (n = 1; 392 women) [51], the USA (n = 2; 806 women) [55, 56], and Nigeria (n = 1; 440 women) [47]. All studies were cross-sectional in design with sample sizes ranging from 392 to 3000.

        Participant selection after data harmonization
        Of the total 12,513 participants in the P-PUP study, 2046 were excluded due to missing data on age (n = 6), age < 18 years (n = 609), age > 45 (n = 1178), natural/surgical menopause (n = 81), current pregnancy/lactation (n = 40), and ovarian pathology (n = 48). Additionally, 488 participants were excluded due to abnormal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH > 25 IU/L), prolactin (> 67.2 µg/L), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP > 30 nmol/L), or thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH > 5 µU/mL) (Fig. 2, Additional File 1: Table S4). A total number of 9979 participants was included in the final analysis following data harmonization. The predominant ethnicities represented in reproductive-age women were 40.1% Asian Han Chinese, 23.8% White Iranians, and 9.5% White Russians (Fig. 3).Fig. 2Flow chart for study participant selection. Note: TSH, prolactin, and 17-OHP were not consistently collected across the total populations in the studies, as some studies collect the data on women suspected of having PCOSFig. 3Ethnicity distribution of the study participants
      
      
        Assessment of ovulatory dysfunction
        All studies collected information on ovulatory dysfunction (OD) through the assessment of menstrual cycles, but the data collection methods were heterogeneous. Four studies collected data about OD in categorical form [48, 52, 55, 56], with differing cut-offs: fewer than 21 days, 21–35 days, or greater than 35 days [52]; 35 days or less or greater than 35 days [56]; less than 26 days and greater than 35 days [55]; and another reported it as a binary with regular (21–35 days) or irregular (fewer than 21 days, greater than 35 days or irregular bleeding) [48]. Six studies collected actual menstrual cycle length [26, 31, 47, 49, 53, 54], seven studies collected the number of menstrual cycles per year [31, 47, 49–51, 53, 54], and one study recorded the minimum and maximum menstrual cycle lengths, in addition to the overall menstrual cycle length [31]. One study also reported minimum and maximum cycle lengths and cycle numbers per year in addition to the categorical menstrual cycle status, with nearly 60% missing data [48]. Except for one study [31] which had 4% (62/1550) missing data, the remaining studies provided complete data on OD (Additional file 1: Table S5).
        The definitions of OD varied across studies and are summarized in Table 1. Most studies defined OD based on menstrual cycle length or the number of menstrual cycles per year, with some including progesterone levels to further assess ovulation status. OD was most commonly defined by using an upper limit of menstrual cycle length greater than 35 days [31, 47–49, 52–56], with another study using a threshold of greater than 34 days [51]. The lower limit for menstrual cycle length also varied, with three studies using less than 21 days [31, 48, 49, 53], one study using less than 24 days [51], one using less than 26 days [55], and another one using less than 25 days [47]. For the number of menstrual cycles per year, four studies defined OD as less than eight menstrual cycles per year [26, 31, 47, 52], while two studies used the cut-off of fewer than nine cycles per year [55, 56]. Additionally, three studies incorporated a lack of menses for three consecutive months as part of their OD definition [26, 49–51, 54, 55]. Mid-luteal progesterone level was utilized by three studies as part of their assessment of OD [51, 54, 55]. The reported prevalence of OD in the included studies ranged from 9.2 to 31.9%, with an overall aggregated prevalence of 18.2%. For data harmonization, we defined OD as fewer than eight or more than 17 menstrual cycles per year and/or a menstrual cycle length of less than 21 days or greater than 35 days, in alignment with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines [2–5]. Based on this definition, the prevalence of OD across the included studies ranged from 3.7 to 31.9%, with an overall prevalence of 15.3% (Table 2).

        Assessment of clinical hyperandrogenism
        All included studies assessed clinical hyperandrogenism, using hirsutism as a primary criterion [26, 31, 47–56]. Hirsutism was assessed directly by a health professional, including gynecologists, midwives, physicians, nurses, endocrinologists, and general practitioners using the mFG score. Hirsutism was defined by an mFG score of 6 or higher in six studies [26, 47, 48, 51, 55, 56], 8 or higher in five studies [49, 50, 52–54], and 5 or higher in one study [31].
        All studies reported acne [26, 31, 47–56], with nine providing IPD [26, 47, 49, 50, 52–56], and three incorporating acne into their definition of clinical hyperandrogenism [48, 52, 54]. One study employed the Burke-Cunliffe acne grading method, assessed by a physician [50]; six studies employed the standard acne lesion assessment of the face, back, and chest, assessed by gynecologists, midwives, physicians, and general practitioners [31, 47, 49, 52–54]; two studies mentioned that no specific acne scoring system was used, with assessments conducted by nurses [55, 56], while another two studies did not provide details on the acne scoring tools used, with assessments conducted by physicians [48, 51]. One study used self-reported acne without a specific scoring system [26]. Among studies that included acne in their clinical hyperandrogenism definition, a score of two or higher was used in one study [52], six or higher in another [54], and the cut-off was not specified in one study [48].
        Six studies reported on the presence of female pattern hair loss (FPHL) [31, 47, 50, 52, 54, 55], with four providing IPD [47, 50, 54, 55], and two incorporated FPHL into their definition of clinical hyperandrogenism [50, 54]. The presence of FPHL was assessed by gynecologists, physicians, nurses, and general practitioners using the Ludwig scale in three studies [31, 50, 52], while three other studies provided no details on the FPHL assessment tool used [47, 54, 55]. FPHL was reported in a categorized form in two studies with no cut-offs provided [50, 54].
        For data harmonization, we defined clinical hyperandrogenism using hirsutism only in alignment with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines which highlights hirsutism as the strongest predictor of hyperandrogenism. We used ethnicity-specific mFG score cut-offs derived from k-means (k = 2) cluster analysis in our recent publication [43]. The thresholds were set at mFG score ≥ 8 for Iranians, ≥ 7 for White Italians and Black Africans, ≥ 5 for Asian Han Chinese, White Russians, Turkish, and Black Americans, and ≥ 4 for White Americans, Asian Koreans, Asian Russians, and Mixed Russians [43]. Based on these cut-offs, the prevalence of clinical hyperandrogenism ranged from 8.1 to 34.2% in individual included studies, with an overall aggregate prevalence of 14.2% (Table 3).

        Assessment of biochemical hyperandrogenism
        Biochemical hyperandrogenism was assessed in all included studies except for one study done in Nigeria [47]. Seven studies assessed all participants [31, 48–51, 53, 56], three studies [26, 54, 55] assessed selective subgroups, and the remaining one study collected blood samples from a random half of the population [52]. Among the studies that assessed androgen levels in selective subgroups, Tehrani et al. assessed only participants with either hirsutism (mFG score ≥ 8) or menstrual disorder (26% of the sample, 260/1000) [54]; Azziz et al. assessed only participants with menstrual dysfunction (48.7% of the sample, 189/388) [55]; and Kim et al. assessed participants who consented to provide blood samples (32.1% of the sample, 160/499) [26].
        Of the included studies, 11 reported total testosterone (TT) [26, 31, 48–54, 56], seven reported calculated free androgen index (FAI) [26, 31, 49, 51–54], eight reported androstenedione (A4) [49–56], and nine reported dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) [26, 31, 49–51, 53–56]. The assay method used included enzyme immunoassay (EIA) [49, 53, 54], liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) [31, 50], chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) [31, 51, 52], radioimmunoassay (RIA) after extraction [55, 56], and RIA [26, 48, 51, 55, 56] (Table 1). Three studies reported free testosterone (FT) [48, 55, 56]: two reported calculated FT (cFT), derived from TT measured by an in-house RIA after serum extraction and SHBG binding activity by equilibrium dialysis using Sephadex G-25 and [3H]T as the ligand, and approximations for binding to albumin [55, 56], while one study reported directly measured FT utilizing RIA [48].
        Biochemical hyperandrogenism was defined using the selected control subgroups as above 95th percentile in eight studies [26, 49, 51–56], above 97.5th percentile in one study [50], above 97.7th percentile (equivalent to 2 standard deviations above the mean in normally distributed data) in another study [48], and above 98th percentile in one study [31] (Table 1). The prevalence of biochemical hyperandrogenism varied widely across studies, ranging from 5.6 to 30.0%, with an overall prevalence of 17.4%. In this study, we adapted the 95th percentile cut-off specific to each study for harmonization to account for variations in assay methods and reference ranges across studies. We used first-line tests (TT, FT, cFT, and FAI) and second-line tests (A4 and DHEAS) when first-line tests were negative, as per the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines. This approach revealed a biochemical hyperandrogenism prevalence ranging from 11.0 to 30.3%, with an overall prevalence of 20.4%. The overall prevalence remained nearly the same at 20.2% when studies assessing selective subgroups of populations were excluded (Table 4).

The reported laboratory values were converted to the SI unit using the following conversion factors: for A4 3.49 from ng/mL to nmol/L and 0.00349 from pg/mL to nmol/L; for TT 3.47 from ng/mL to nmol/L and 0.0347 from ng/dL to nmol/L; for FT 0.003467 from pg/mL to nmol/L and 0.03467 from ng/dL to nmol/L; for DHEAS 0.00271 ng/mL to µmol/L and 0.0271 µg/dL to µmol/L. For data harmonization, we utilized the 95th percentile cut-off specific to each individual study population, applying first-line tests (TT, FT, and FAI) and incorporating A4 and DHEAS when first-line tests were negative, in accordance with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines
      
      
        Assessment of polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM)
        Eight included studies assessed all participants for PCOM. One study provided PCOM as a binary variable [49], OV data was provided by six studies [26, 31, 47, 48, 51, 52], while AFC was provided by seven studies [26, 31, 47, 48, 51–53]. The imaging modalities used included transvaginal ultrasound with a band frequency ranging from 5 to 13 MHz, and transabdominal ultrasound with a band frequency ranging from 1 to 9 MHz. Additionally, transrectal ultrasound was utilized in two studies [26, 52]. Unfortunately, the IPD in the included studies did not specify the ultrasound approach, either transvaginal, transabdominal, or transrectal.
        Except for Makwe et al. which defined PCOM as having an AFC count of ≥ 20 and/or OV ≥ 10cm3 [47], all other included studies used older criteria, defining PCOM as having an AFC count of ≥ 12 and/or OV ≥ 10cm3 [26, 31, 48, 49, 51–53]. The reported prevalence of PCOM varied widely across studies, ranging from 6.6 to 39.9%, with an overall prevalence of 19.2% (Table 5). Due to the heterogeneity in imaging modalities, ultrasound approaches, and lack of IPD, data harmonization for PCOM was not feasible, and thus we relied on each study’s original definitions and categorization.

        Prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
        Of the included study, eight defined PCOS using the Rotterdam criteria [26, 31, 47–49, 51–53], while the remaining four used the National Institutes of Health (NIH 1990) criteria and did not include ultrasound data for PCOM [50, 54–56]. The reported prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 19.8%, with an overall prevalence of 11.7% using each study’s original definition. For data harmonization, we defined PCOS by applying the International PCOS Guidelines criteria, requiring two out of three key features: OD, hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. We defined OD as fewer than eight or more than 17 menstrual cycles per year and/or a menstrual cycle length of less than 21 days or greater than 35 days; we defined hyperandrogenism as either clinical (limited to ethnicity-specific hirsutism scores) or biochemical (using study-specific 95th percentile cut-offs for first-line androgen tests, supplemented by secondary markers when first-line tests were negative), in accordance with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines recommendations. Post harmonization, the prevalence of PCOS ranged from 3.3 to 18.3%, with an overall prevalence of 11.0% (Table 6).

      Discussion
      The P-PUP study represents the first international IPD-based meta-analysis involving unselected (medically unbiased) women from the general population, assessed for PCOS features, offering a unique and diverse cohort to explore PCOS characteristics across heterogeneous populations. This comprehensive dataset includes a large sample size of 9979 women aged 18–45 years from 11 primary ethnicities, eight countries and four continents. Our analysis revealed significant heterogeneity in data collection methods and the definitions used for PCOS diagnostic features, particularly in the assessment of ovulatory dysfunction. This variability contributed to a wide range of reported prevalence of PCOS across original studies, from 3.3 to 19.8% (11.7% overall). After data harmonization, the PCOS prevalence ranged from 3.3 to 18.3%, with an overall prevalence of 11.0%.
      Ovulatory dysfunction (OD) is a key component in the International Guidelines PCOS diagnostic criteria, focused on menstrual cyclicity, and irregular cycle length and number per year. The International PCOS Guidelines [2–6], defined irregular cycles as > 90 days for any one cycle in women 1-year post menarche, < 21 or > 45 days in women one to less than 3 years post menarche, < 21 or > 35 days or < 8 cycles per year in women 3 years post-menarche to perimenopause, while acknowledging the need for further research [57]. We identified significant variations in menstrual cycle data collection, especially prior to the International PCOS Guidelines. Categorical and continuous data was collected, including average cycle length in days, average cycle number per year, minimum and maximum cycle length and cycle number per year. OD cut-offs were variable across studies. Here, we harmonized OD data aligned with Guideline recommendations, reporting a prevalence of 3.7% to 31.9% or 15.5% overall. Future studies should collect standardized continuous data on cycle length (in days) and cycle number per year, with clear explanations of cycle length as the number of days from the first day of one period to the first day of the next, to limit confusion with the duration of menstrual bleeding. While acknowledging the inherent variability of cycles in PCOS and limitations of self-reported data for large-scale epidemiology studies, standardized data collection and definitions would substantially minimize error while ensuring consistency and comparability across studies. The International PCOS Guideline’s OD cut-offs were derived from the 95th percentile of menstrual cycle duration, based on variable control populations which likely included women with PCOS [58]. Using this percentile as a diagnostic cut-off, particularly when it is not linked with clinical outcomes, including anthropometric outcomes (weight, waist-hip circumference, BMI), reproductive outcomes (androgens, ovulation frequency, pregnancy complications), and cardiometabolic (insulin resistance, lipid profiles, blood pressure, fasting glucose), represents a crude and overly simplistic approach [58]. Moving forward, applying advanced analytics including cluster analysis to define cut-offs based on well-defined unselected populations and clinical correlates such as association with other PCOS features or with long-term outcomes is a research priority captured in the International PCOS Research Road Map [59].
      Hyperandrogenism is an essential PCOS diagnostic feature and manifests clinically as hirsutism, acne and androgenic alopecia. Acne and androgenic alopecia are relatively nonspecific markers of hyperandrogenism, particularly in PCOS [2–5, 16]. While validated scoring systems exist for acne and androgenic alopecia, these are not universally agreed upon for PCOS due to limited research in PCOS populations, ethnic variations, and clinical contexts. In included original studies, acne and alopecia were inconsistently reported, with variable tools and definitions. In contrast, hirsutism is strongly correlated with biochemical hyperandrogenism and is the most reliable clinical sign of hyperandrogenism in PCOS [60, 61]. The modified Ferriman-Gallwey (mFG) visual scale is Guideline recommended [62] and was used in all included original studies. Historically, a cut-off mFG score of ≥ 8 defined hirsutism in PCOS, based on a misinterpretation of original Ferriman and Gallwey data at the 95th percentile of a predominantly white population [63, 64]. In P-PUP IPD we established ethnicity-specific mFG cut-offs via k-means cluster analysis, with cut-offs ranging between 4–6 for the majority of populations [43]. This aligns with the International PCOS Guidelines recommendations for an mFG score of 4–6 to diagnose hirsutism [2–5]. Clinical hyperandrogenism ranged from 6.8 to 28.4% (13.7% overall) in original studies with variable mFG cut-offs and use of acne and alopecia. With cluster analysis cut-offs and data harmonization, we report a prevalence of 8.1% to 34.2% (14.2% overall) and aligned to Guidelines, cluster-defined mFG cut-offs are recommended.
      Biochemical hyperandrogenism in PCOS focuses on elevated free testosterone, which may be measured directly or calculated primarily through FAI and cFT. Our recent systematic review and meta-analysis informed the International PCOS Guidelines recommendation to use TT and FT as a first-line laboratory test for biochemical hyperandrogenism [65] using LC–MS/MS methods with the best accuracy [66, 67]. In the P-PUP study, only two original studies used LC–MS/MS [31, 50], all others relied on less specific and sensitive immunoassay. Cut-offs for biochemical hyperandrogenism varied, with arbitrary thresholds at the 95th, 97.5th, or 98th percentile of healthy controls. In P-PUP we adapted the 95th percentile cut-off for androgens specific to each study to harmonize data reporting a prevalence from 11.0 to 30.3% in original studies, with an overall prevalence of 20.4%. Further cluster analyses are underway to refine definitions and address persisting limitations.
      PCOM is evaluated using pelvic ultrasonography and is characterized by either ovarian enlargement, measured as increased OV, and/or an excess of small antral follicles, either within the entire ovary (FNPO) or a single cross-sectional image (FNPS) [68]. Cut-offs for OV and FNPO vary by ultrasound technology and approach. The 2023 International PCOS Guidelines recommend the transvaginal ultrasound approach, FNPO ≥ 20 in at least one ovary or OV ≥ 10 ml to define PCOM in adults. If older ultrasound technology is used, the AFC count is ≥ 12 in at least one ovary. PCOM is not recommended in adolescents as it lacks specificity [2–5]. In the present analysis, only one study adhered to these recommendations and transabdominal and transrectal ultrasound approaches were also used, with no validated PCOM cut-offs, limiting harmonization and resulting in the retention of original study definitions. Guidelines now clearly recommend a transvaginal ultrasound, and cut-offs for FNPO and OV which need to be applied, along with the inclusion of AMH measurements.
      
        Strengths and limitations
        This study has several strengths. Firstly, this IPD is unique and includes a large diverse, international IPD set, with generalizability to those with PCOS. Unselected participants also minimize selection bias, as seen in clinic-based cohorts. Also, the IPD analysis allowed standardization of definitions and cut-offs across studies and aligned with the 2023 International PCOS Guidelines to minimize heterogeneity and enhance comparability. Limitations include heterogeneity in data collection methods, particularly for ovulatory dysfunction, hyperandrogenism, and PCOM. Some original data could not be harmonized, affecting the comparability of results across populations. Most original studies relied on immunoassays for androgen measurement, which are less accurate than LC-MS/MS. Most studies also used older ultrasound technology and variable approaches and lacked sufficient methodological detail, with reliance on original study PCOM definitions. Although serum AMH is now recommended as an alternative marker for PCOM, this data was not available. Lastly, although the study included participants from four continents and eight countries, including participants from diverse ethnic backgrounds enhanced generalizability, notable geographic and cultural gaps in representation persist, underscoring the need for more globally comprehensive PCOS research.
      
    
    
      Conclusions
      The P-PUP study brings together an unprecedented cohort of ethnically diverse, unselected population-level data to enable research and advance knowledge in PCOS. In integrating this IPD we have shown a lack of standardized data collection methods across original studies. Cut-offs for PCOS diagnostic features also vary, jeopardizing diagnostic accuracy and consistency and impacting data harmonization. This work directly addresses the high research priorities identified in the PCOS Guidelines research roadmap, which emphasizes creating international data repositories and standardizing research approaches [59]. Future research efforts should prioritize the standardization of data collection methods that align with the International PCOS Guidelines and PCOS core outcome sets [39], while simultaneously refining definitions and establishing accurate normative cut-offs for individual PCOS diagnostic features. These diagnostic thresholds should be based on cluster analysis and natural groupings, identifying diagnostic clusters that are linked to short and long-term outcomes in medically unbiased, unselected, and diverse populations. This dual approach to standardization would facilitate big data integration and the development of machine learning–driven models for precision medicine in PCOS.

Title: Multiomics analysis revealed the regulatory role of chenodeoxycholic acid in fatty acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis

Abstract: ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the regulatory role and mechanisms of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on lipid metabolism, and to evaluate its therapeutic potential in lipid metabolism-related diseases such as acne, seborrheic alopecia, and prostate cancer, with the aim of identifying safer and more sustainable treatment alternatives.MethodsLipid-overproduction models were established using RM-1 (murine prostate cancer cells) and primary sebaceous gland cells, stimulated by linoleic acid (LA) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), respectively. CDCA’s mechanisms were explored using transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics. In vivo validation was conducted via intradermal injection of CDCA into the sebaceous gland area of golden hamsters to assess its effect on sebaceous lipid metabolism.ResultsCDCA significantly reduced intracellular lipid accumulation in both murine prostate cancer cells (RM-1) and primary sebaceous gland cells, and suppressed the expression of the androgen receptor (AR), along with the downregulation of key lipogenic enzymes (SREBF1, FASN, FADS2). Mitochondrial membrane potential was restored in CDCA-treated cells. Multi-omics analyses revealed that CDCA modulated fatty acid biosynthesis and degradation, energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, and Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPAR-γ) signaling. Lipidomic profiling demonstrated a shift from saturated to unsaturated fatty acid dominance after CDCA treatment. In vivo, CDCA decreased sebaceous lipid accumulation and downregulated PPAR-γ expression in golden hamsters.ConclusionCDCA exerted multifaceted regulatory effects on lipid metabolism, hormone signaling, and mitochondrial dynamics. These effects contributed to the maintenance of sebaceous gland homeostasis and supported the development of innovative and potentially more biocompatible therapies for lipid-related disorders.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12944-025-02656-w.

Body: Introduction
      Lipid homeostasis refers to the state in which organisms maintain the balance of lipid levels, encompassing multiple aspects such as fatty acid metabolism. As fundamental units of lipid metabolism, fatty acids play pivotal roles in critical physiological processes including energy supply, cellular membrane structure, and signal transduction [1–3]. However, dysregulation of lipid metabolism is closely associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases, particularly in cancer and dermatological disorders. For instance, in prostate cancer, aberrant lipid metabolism not only contributes to tumorigenesis but also correlates with malignant progression and therapeutic resistance [4–6]. In dermatology, disrupted lipid metabolism is implicated in acne and seborrheic alopecia. Excessive lipid accumulation drives acne pathogenesis, while abnormal lipid metabolism may alter the follicular microenvironment in seborrheic alopecia [7, 8]. Thus, elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of lipid homeostasis is essential for understanding disease mechanisms and developing novel therapeutic strategies.
      Bear bile, a traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely utilized for its heat-clearing, detoxifying, liver-soothing, and vision-improving properties. Ancient texts such as the Xiao’ er Weisheng Zongwei Lun Fang (Compendium of Pediatric Health and Refined Prescriptions) documented the use of “Xiongdan Shexiang Wan” (Bear Bile and Musk Pill) to treat pediatric malnutrition syndromes, stating: “For treating pediatric malnutrition syndromes, abdominal distension, pica, and persistent fever” [9]. The term “malnutrition syndromes” in modern contexts may correlate with metabolic disorders, including malnutrition and digestive dysfunction, both linked to lipid metabolism. Studies indicate that bear bile powder improves lipid profiles by reducing total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) while elevating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels [10–12]. Furthermore, clinical research demonstrates that bear bile-containing formulations and bear bile powder itself exhibit efficacy in managing lipid metabolism disorders such as hyperlipidemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [13, 14]. These findings highlight bear bile’s potential in modulating fatty acid metabolism and maintaining lipid homeostasis.
      Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), the primary bioactive components of bear bile powder [15–17], have shown therapeutic promise in metabolic disorders. Both bile acids improve hepatic function, regulate cholesterol metabolism, and mitigate inflammation, with established clinical applications in NAFLD and primary biliary cholangitis [18–20].
      However, despite this growing recognition, the potential of CDCA in regulating fatty acid metabolism outside hepatic contexts—particularly in tumor biology and dermatological lipid disorders—remains largely unexplored.
      In particular, the roles of CDCA in sebaceous lipid metabolism and its molecular targets in prostate cancer and sebaceous glands have not been systematically elucidated.
      Addressing this gap may offer new insights into the extrahepatic functions of bile acids and contribute to the development of novel metabolic therapies for skin and cancer-related disorders.
      Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of CDCA in modulating fatty acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis in both prostate cancer and sebaceous gland models. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics, the study sought to elucidate the molecular pathways involved and identify potential therapeutic targets of CDCA in the context of cancer and dermatological lipid disorders.
    
    
      Materials and methods
      
        Cell culture of RM-1 and primary sebaceous gland cells
        RM-1 cells (CL-0198, Procell Life Science & Technology, Wuhan, China) and primary sebaceous gland cells (CTCC-280-HUM, Meisen Cell Technology, Hangzhou, China) were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37℃ with 5% CO2. Humidity was maintained by placing 3000 mL of sterile distilled water in the incubator to prevent medium evaporation. RM-1 cells were cultured in DMEM medium (SH30022.01, HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (PSA). Primary sebaceous gland cells were maintained in specialized epithelial cell medium (CTCC-009-613, Meisen Cell Technology, Hangzhou, China), composed of basal medium, 10% FBS, 1% epithelial cell growth supplement (ECGS), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells within passages 4–8 were used for experiments. Routine subculturing was performed when cells reached 80% confluency.
        STR profiling confirmed that the sebaceous gland cells were of human origin, consistent with the supplier’s documentation. In addition, immunostaining for keratin 7 (KRT7)—a cytoskeletal protein expressed in epithelial lineages including sebaceous cells—was used to further support their identity (Supplementary Material 3). All STR authentication results are provided in Supplementary Materials 1–3.
      
      
        CCK-8 assay
        RM-1 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in culture medium. Cell suspensions (8,000 cells/well) were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ until adherent. Cholic acid (CA, 81-25-4, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), deoxycholic acid (DCA, 83-44-3, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), UDCA (128-13-2, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and CDCA(474-25-9, Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were diluted in serum-free medium to concentrations of 0–500 µmol/L. After 24 h of treatment, 10 µL of CCK-8 solution (CK04, Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) and 90 µL of serum-free medium were added to each well. Plates were gently shaken to ensure uniform distribution and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy H1, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Cell proliferation rates were calculated as:
        Cell viability (%) = [(Experimental group– Blank control) / (Negative control– Blank control)] × 100.
      
      
        Nile red staining for lipid detection
        RM-1 and primary sebaceous gland cells in the logarithmic phase were seeded into 96-well plates (8,000 cells/well) and allowed to adhere overnight. Groups included: normal control, LA-treated (0.1 mmol/L for RM-1; 0.0125 mmol/L for primary sebaceous gland cells), and LA combined with CA/DCA/UDCA/CDCA. After 24 h of treatment, cells were exposed to 20 µg/mL dihydrotestosterone (DHT, D413176, Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) for 48 h. Medium was discarded, and cells were washed three times with PBS (5 min each). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (50 µL/well, 20 min), washed with PBS, stained with Nile Red (7385-67-3, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) (50 µL/well, 20 min, dark), and washed again. Triton X-100 (0.5%, 50 µL/well, 5 min) and DAPI (5 min) were sequentially applied. Fluorescence was visualized using an inverted microscope (CKX41, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
      
      
        Mitochondrial membrane potential assay
        Cells were treated for 24 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with 1 mL mitochondrial membrane potential probe (JC-10) staining working solution (CA1310, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) at 37 °C for 20 min. JC-10 staining buffer (1×) was prepared by diluting 5× stock with distilled water (1:4) and stored on ice. After incubation, cells were washed twice with 1× buffer and observed under a fluorescence microscope.
      
      
        qPCR analysis of lipid metabolism genes in RM-1
        Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (15596018, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), reverse-transcribed with ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix (FSQ-201, TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan), and quantified. qPCR was performed using SYBR Green Premix (PK-201, TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) in 20 µL reactions (95 °C for 30 s, 40 cycles). GAPDH served as the reference gene. Relative mRNA levels were calculated via the 2^−ΔΔCt method. The PCR primer (Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Material 4.
      
      
        Western blot analysis
        After 24 h of treatment, cells were harvested for protein extraction. Protein lysates were normalized based on concentration, mixed with loading buffer, and denatured at 100 °C for 10 min. Approximately 20–40 µg of protein (in a volume of 5–15 µL) per lane was separated by SDS-PAGE at 200 V. After the bromophenol blue front reached the gel bottom, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against fatty acid synthase (FASN), sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), and Histone 3 (all diluted 1:1000). Notably, the anti-FASN (A19050), anti-FADS2 (A24354), and anti-Histone 3 (A4835) antibodies were obtained from Abclonal Biotechnology Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China), while the anti-SREBF1 antibody (14088-1-AP) was purchased from Proteintech (Rosemont, IL, USA). The next day, membranes were washed thrice with TBST (10 min each) and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by further TBST washes. Signal detection was performed using ECL reagents and visualized on a ChemiDoc imaging system (BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA).
      
      
        Multi-Omics profiling
        
          RNA-Seq
          Cell samples from RM-1 were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground, and lysed in 1 mL of pre-chilled Trizol. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Next, 200 µL of pre-chilled chloroform was added, mixed vigorously, and allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature. Following another centrifugation, the aqueous phase was collected, mixed with an equal volume of pre-chilled isopropanol, and incubated for 10 min. After centrifugation, the RNA pellet was washed with 1 mL of 75% ethanol, briefly air-dried (3–5 min), and resuspended in 20–50 µL of 0.1% DEPC-treated water. The total RNA was then used for mRNA enrichment, fragmentation, cDNA synthesis, adapter ligation, and subsequent sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq Xplus platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Data analysis—including read alignment, expression quantification, differential expression analysis, and KEGG enrichment using the Python SciPy package—was performed. Please refer to Supplementary Material 5 for details.
        
        
          Fatty acid metabolomics
          primary sebaceous gland cells samples (300 µL per sample, diluted 2×) were stored at − 80 °C. A mixed standard solution of 50 common fatty acids was prepared at 2000 µg/mL and further diluted using a 50% acetonitrile–isopropanol solution. Isotopically labeled internal standards were also prepared. Fatty acids were extracted using acetonitrile and isopropanol to ensure efficient recovery. Quantification was performed using UHPLC-MS/MS (AB SCIEX ExionLC™ AD system coupled with a QTRAP® 6500 + mass spectrometer) in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Standard curves generated from known concentrations were used to determine sample concentrations, with statistical analyses performed using Microsoft Excel and appropriate statistical software.
        
        
          Deep data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics
          Proteins from primary sebaceous gland cell samples were extracted and analyzed using an Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer in a DIA workflow. This method enables simultaneous collection of fragment data from all precursor ions, providing enhanced coverage and reproducibility compared to data-dependent acquisition (DDA). Quantitative analysis was conducted using DIA-NN software with retention time calibration via internal peptide standards. Differentially expressed proteins were defined as those with expression changes greater than 1.2-fold or less than 0.83-fold and a P-value < 0.05. Functional annotation and enrichment analyses were carried out using the COG, GO, and KEGG databases, and protein–protein interaction networks were constructed to elucidate biological functions.
        
      
      
        Golden hamster model
        Three SPF-grade golden hamsters (average weight ~ 120 g, 8 weeks old) were procured from Beijing Weitong Lihua Experimental Animal Technology Co., Ltd. and housed in the Animal Experimental Facility of the Institute of Basic Theory, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (License No. SCXX (Beijing) 2021-0006). The animals were maintained under controlled environmental conditions (temperature 20–24 °C, humidity 40–60%, 12-hour light/dark cycle, with adequate ventilation, standardized feed, and ad libitum water). The hair on the sebaceous gland regions of both sides of the abdomen was removed prior to experimentation. The experimental group received subcutaneous injections of a CDCA injection solution in the right-side sebaceous gland region, prepared per 2 mL as follows: 2 mg CDCA, 18 mg benzyl alcohol, 2.84 mg disodium hydrogen phosphate, 8.76 mg sodium chloride, 2.86 mg sodium hydroxide, and injection water, with pH adjusted to 8.3 as needed using hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. The control group was administered an equivalent volume of blank control solution. Injections were given daily for six consecutive days, and data were recorded at various time points.
      
      
        Dermatoscopic data acquisition
        Following induction of anesthesia with isoflurane, the dorsal hair of the golden hamsters was removed using depilatory cream and thoroughly washed with physiological saline. Once the skin was dry, a medical electronic dermatoscope (CH-DSIS-2000, Chuanghong Medical Technology, China) equipped with a 20× lens was placed in close contact with the skin. The focus was adjusted until a clear image of the sebaceous gland region was obtained, and parameters such as gland size and pigment deposition were recorded.
      
      
        Oil red O staining
        Frozen Sect. (10 μm thick) of the sebaceous gland region were prepared and fixed in 10% formalin for 30 min. Sections were then rinsed twice with distilled water (3 min each), treated with 60% isopropanol for 20–30 s, and stained with an improved Oil Red O staining kit (G1261, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China) for 10–15 min. After brief differentiation with 60% isopropanol (5–10 s) and a distilled water rinse (1 min), Mayer’s hematoxylin was applied for 1–2 min. The sections were then washed, air-dried, and mounted with glycerol gelatin. Lipid droplets appeared in shades of orange-red, while nuclei were stained blue.
      
      
        Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining
        Paraffin Sect. (4 μm thick) were deparaffinized and rehydrated prior to staining with an HE staining kit (G1120, Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing, China). Sections were stained with hematoxylin for 2 min, rinsed under running water for 10 min to achieve “blueing,” briefly differentiated with an acidic solution for 10 s, and subsequently stained with eosin for 20 s. After thorough rinsing, the slides were dehydrated, cleared in xylene, and mounted with neutral gum for optical microscopy image acquisition.
      
      
        Immunofluorescence staining
        Frozen Sect. (10 μm thick) from the sebaceous gland region were equilibrated to room temperature and washed three times with PBS (3 min per wash). After blocking with 5% goat serum at room temperature for 1 h to prevent nonspecific binding, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against Ki67 (dilution 1:200) and Cytokeratin 5 (K5, dilution 1:200) (27309-1-AP and 66727-1-Ig, respectively, from Proteintech, Wuhan, China). The following day, sections were washed three times with PBS, incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody (1:1000) at room temperature for 1 h, and finally mounted with DAPI-containing fluorescence mounting medium. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence imaging was performed using a touchscreen microscope (RVL2-K2, Echo Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA) with high-resolution objectives (4x–100x oil) and multi-wavelength LED excitation. Standard fluorophore filter sets (e.g., DAPI, FITC, TRITC, Cy5) were used, and images were captured with a 5 MP CMOS camera (2448 × 2048 pixels). Acquisition and processing were controlled via Revolve software, enabling automated exposure, focus, and filter selection.Image analysis was performed on three independent biological replicates. For each replicate, four images were captured under consistent exposure settings. Two images were averaged to generate one data point, resulting in six statistical values per group (n = 6). This design ensures both data representativeness and statistical reliability.
      
      
        Statistical analysis
        All images were analyzed using ImageJ software (Version 1.8.0, NIH) with standardized protocols. Immunofluorescence intensity was quantified by threshold-based methods (auto-threshold algorithm combined with negative control calibration) to calculate integrated density. Oil Red O staining was processed via RGB color thresholding (Hue 0–30, Saturation 50–255) to determine lipid droplet-positive area percentage (%Area). Prior to analysis, uniform background subtraction and region of interest (ROI) delineation were performed.
        Data were statistically evaluated using GraphPad Prism 8.0. Initial tests for normality (Shapiro–Wilk) and homogeneity of variances (Levene’s test) were performed; if assumptions were violated, non-parametric tests or variance adjustments were applied. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Bonferroni or Tukey post hoc tests for multiple comparisons. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

        Regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism in RM-1 cells
        
          Effects of different bile acids on RM‑1 cell viability and LA-induced lipid accumulation: CDCA’s potent inhibitory effect and concentration advantage
          To systematically evaluate the effects of bile acids on RM-1 cell viability, the concentration-gradient responses of CA, DCA, UDCA, and CDCA were analyzed using CCK-8 assays (Fig. 1A–D). The IC10, IC15, and IC20 concentrations were selected from SPSS-predicted inhibition ranges (IC10-IC25) to enable pharmacological comparisons under equivalent inhibition conditions while maintaining > 80% cell viability for physiologically relevant lipid metabolism studies. As shown in Fig. 1A-D, all bile acids exhibited clear concentration-dependent inhibitory effects, with CDCA demonstrating the strongest potency, as evidenced by its significantly lower IC10 concentration (0.05 µmol/L) compared to other compounds (P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA). Notably, statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed between high-concentration groups (IC20) and 0 µmol/L controls.

Nile Red staining of RM-1 cells co-treated with LA and each bile acid at IC₁₀, IC₁₅, and IC₂₀ concentrations for 24 h: CDCA (G), CA (H), DCA (I), and UDCA (J), nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), and lipids with Nile Red (red), scale bar = 50 μm; K. Quantification of Nile Red fluorescence intensity (n = 6). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001)

          To assess the combined effects of bile acids and linoleic acid (LA, 0.1 mmol/L), the ability of each bile acid to suppress LA-induced lipid accumulation at IC₁₀/IC₁₅/IC₂₀ concentrations was further assessed (Fig. 1E–K). Nile red staining revealed that CDCA and UDCA exhibited markedly stronger lipid-suppressive effects than CA and DCA. Strikingly, CDCA exhibited a 52-fold greater potency than UDCA, achieving comparable lipid suppression at a significantly lower IC₁₀ concentration (0.05 µmol/L vs. 2.6 µmol/L). Given its superior concentration-efficacy profile and robust lipid-modulatory capacity, CDCA was prioritized for subsequent mechanistic investigations.
        
        
          Multiple regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential, and androgen receptor (AR) expression in RM-1 cells
          As illustrated in Fig. 2, CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation induced by linoleic acid (LA, 0.1 mmol/L) in RM-1 cells (Figs. 2A–B). Quantitative analysis of Nile red fluorescence intensity revealed a marked reduction in lipid accumulation in the CDCA-treated group compared to the LA group. Magnified images further demonstrated that CDCA alleviated localized intracellular lipid droplet aggregation (Fig. 2C).

Nile Red staining of RM-1 cells co-treated with DHT and CDCA (IC10-IC20); M. Quantitative analysis of Nile Red fluorescence intensity (n = 6). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001)

          Given the close relationship between lipid synthesis and mitochondrial energy metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) was assessed using JC-10 staining (Figs. 2D–E). LA stimulation significantly increased ΔΨm, indicated by enhanced red fluorescence and diminished green fluorescence, suggesting elevated energy metabolism. In contrast, CDCA treatment significantly reduced the elevated ΔΨm induced by LA, bringing it closer to baseline levels observed in untreated cells. Quantitative analysis of the JC-10 red-to-green fluorescence ratio confirmed that CDCA-treated cells exhibited significantly lower ΔΨm than LA-stimulated cells.
          Although CDCA simultaneously suppressed lipid accumulation and modulated ΔΨm, the causal relationship between these effects remains to be elucidated. LA-induced lipid synthesis may elevate energy demands, thereby augmenting ΔΨm. However, CDCA’s inhibitory effects extend beyond lipid synthesis suppression and may involve indirect mechanisms, such as modulating fatty acid metabolism or mitochondrial function, to influence ΔΨm. Thus, the interplay between reduced lipid synthesis and ΔΨm attenuation likely involves a complex regulatory network requiring further investigation.
          Furthermore, considering the close interplay between lipid metabolism and hormonal signaling in prostate cancer, AR overexpression in RM-1 cells was induced using DHT. After 48 h of DHT stimulation, both AR expression and lipid accumulation were significantly elevated (Figs. 2G–H). Additionally, CCK-8 proliferation assays demonstrated that DHT not only enhanced lipid accumulation but also increased cellular viability (Fig. 2F).
          Importantly, co-treatment with CDCA and DHT substantially reduced DHT-induced AR upregulation (Figs. 2I–K). These findings suggest that CDCA may regulate lipid synthesis and metabolism by modulating androgen signaling through AR suppression. This mechanistic insight underscores CDCA’s potential therapeutic value in lipid metabolism-related disorders, such as acne. Acne pathogenesis is closely linked to increased androgen levels and altered lipid metabolism. Elevated androgens, particularly DHT, stimulate sebaceous glands to produce excessive sebum, leading to clogged pores and promoting the growth of Cutibacterium acnes, a bacterium implicated in acne inflammation. Additionally, lipid metabolic dysfunction impairs the skin barrier and fosters an inflammatory environment conducive to acne development.
          Moreover, under 2-DHT treatment, lipid accumulation increased, while CDCA was able to suppress lipid accumulation concurrently with AR inhibition (Figs. 2L–M), further elucidating the positive correlation between AR and lipid metabolism.

          CDCA modulates lipid metabolism in RM-1 cells via regulation of fatty acid and energy metabolic pathways
          RNA sequencing analysis revealed that co-treatment with CDCA and LA significantly altered gene expression profiles in RM-1 cells (Fig. 3A). Compared to the LA-treated group, the CDCA + LA group exhibited 72 upregulated and 57 downregulated genes (Fig. 3C). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predominantly associated with lipid and fatty acid metabolism-related pathways (Fig. 3D). Notably, the enrichment of the fatty acid metabolism pathway underscores CDCA’s pivotal role in regulating fatty acid synthesis, degradation, and metabolic homeostasis. Additionally, the enrichment of TGF-β and FoxO signaling pathways suggests that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism through indirect mechanisms. The involvement of the GnRH signaling pathway further implies that CDCA could modulate fatty acid metabolism via endocrine regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, pathways related to energy metabolism, including ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, were enriched, suggesting a potential link between CDCA treatment and alterations in cellular energy homeostasis. Furthermore, the enrichment of pathways like amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism suggests potential interactions between carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the regulation of fatty acids.

Western blot analysis showing the expression levels of lipid metabolism-related proteins (FASN, SREBF1, FADS2) in RM-1 cells, with Histone 3 serving as the internal control, the original Western blot bands are provided in Supplementary Material 6. Statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA compared to the LA group. Significance indicators: *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001

          Further KEGG enrichment analysis focused on lipid metabolism-related pathways (Fig. 3E). The results demonstrated significant enrichment in pathways including fatty acid metabolism, fatty acid degradation, biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and bile acid biosynthesis. Energy metabolism-related pathways, such as the AMPK signaling pathway and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, were also closely associated with lipid metabolism. Sankey diagram analysis identified key genes involved in these differential pathways, including aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 family member (ALDH2), acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain (ACADVL), carbonyl reductase 4 (CBR4), hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 4 (HSD17B4), and Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 2 (PCSK2) (Fig. 3F). Specifically, ACADVL and HSD17B4, involved in fatty acid metabolism and degradation pathways, suggest that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism by regulating the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. CBR4, associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, further emphasizes CDCA’s role in regulating fatty acid composition. Additionally, genes related to cholesterol metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis, such as ALDH2, indicate that CDCA may indirectly participate in the regulation of lipid homeostasis by affecting cholesterol and bile acid metabolism.
          Building upon RNA-Seq analyses and previous experimental findings, the regulatory effects of CDCA on lipid and fatty acid metabolism were further investigated. Key genes associated with lipid synthesis include SREBF1 and Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase (ACC), while genes pivotal in fatty acid metabolism encompass FASN and Fatty Acid Desaturases 1–3 (FADS1-3). The mRNA expression levels of these critical factors were assessed (Fig. 3G–L), and CDCA was found to significantly downregulate their expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis further confirmed the downregulation of lipid metabolism-related proteins, including FASN, SREBF1, and FADS2, upon CDCA treatment (Fig. 3M). Collectively, these findings suggest that CDCA modulates lipid metabolism by downregulating the expression of genes and proteins involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism, highlighting its potential application in regulating lipid metabolic processes.
        
      
      
        In vivo and in vitro validation of CDCA regulation on sebaceous gland lipid metabolism
        
          Regulation of sebaceous gland activity and lipid accumulation by CDCA in golden hamsters
          To elucidate the mechanisms underlying CDCA’s effects on lipid metabolism, this study utilized golden hamsters—an animal model characterized by a well-developed sebaceous gland system. Upon intradermal injection of CDCA into the sebaceous gland region, dermoscopic examination revealed a slight, non-significant reduction in the area of this region, accompanied by mild local inflammation and decreased melanin deposition (Fig. 4A). Oil Red O staining indicated that CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation in the sebaceous gland area, indicating its regulatory role in lipid metabolism (Fig. 4B–C). Further histological analysis through Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining showed no significant morphological changes in sebaceous gland tissue structure, suggesting that CDCA does not cause structural damage to the glands; however, a noticeable reduction in gland size was observed (Fig. 4D–E). Immunofluorescence staining revealed a significant decrease in Ki67 expression in peripheral sebaceous gland cells, indicating reduced cellular activity (Fig. 4G). Additionally, the expression levels of AR and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), both closely associated with lipid metabolism, were diminished following CDCA treatment. This finding aligns with observations in RM-1 cells, where CDCA not only regulates lipid metabolism but also affects AR expression. These results suggest that CDCA may modulate sebaceous 
        
      
      
        Gland homeostasis by influencing peripheral sebaceous gland cell activity, as well as androgen accumulation and the expression of lipid-related regulatory proteins such as PPAR-γ

        In summary, the study demonstrates that CDCA regulates sebaceous gland homeostasis by reducing lipid accumulation and cellular activity, potentially through the modulation of AR and PPAR-γ. Importantly, this effect occurs without disrupting the overall glandular structure, providing a theoretical basis for the application of CDCA in treating sebaceous gland-related disorders.
        
          Regulation of fatty acid composition and lipid accumulation by CDCA in primary sebaceous gland cells
          Building upon previous in vivo findings demonstrating that CDCA inhibits lipid accumulation and AR expression in the sebaceous glands of golden hamsters, its effects on sebaceous gland cells were further investigated using a primary sebaceous gland cell model.
          Lipidomic analysis (Fig. 5A) revealed that CDCA treatment significantly altered the fatty acid composition in primary sebaceous gland cells, including increased levels of various unsaturated fatty acids (such as linoleic acid and arachidonic acid) and polyunsaturated fatty acids, while decreasing certain saturated fatty acids (like palmitic acid). These changes suggest that CDCA optimizes the fatty acid profile by enhancing anti-inflammatory fatty acids (e.g., linoleic acid, which promotes skin barrier repair) and reducing pro-inflammatory saturated fatty acids.

Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA versus control group: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001

          Further Deep DIA proteomic analysis (Fig. 5B) unveiled the regulatory mechanisms of CDCA. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that CDCA modulates pathways related to fatty acid metabolism and degradation, including β-oxidation and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Additionally, CDCA significantly impacts mitochondrial function-related pathways (such as ATP synthesis and mitochondrial metabolism), implying its influence on lipid metabolism through mitochondrial energy regulation.
          A CCK-8 assay identified a non-toxic concentration of CDCA for primary sebaceous gland cells (25 µmol/L) (Fig. 5C). Nile Red staining (Fig. 5E and G) further confirmed that CDCA inhibits lipid accumulation in primary sebaceous gland cells. Under linoleic acid (0.0125 mmol/L) stimulation, CDCA significantly suppressed lipid accumulation, demonstrating its direct regulatory effect on sebocyte lipid metabolism.
          CDCA reduced mitochondrial membrane potential in primary sebaceous gland cells, mirroring the effects observed in RM-1 cells. Moreover, considering the association between lipid accumulation and androgens, CDCA decreased AR expression and lipid accumulation induced by 2-DHT (Fig. 5H–K), aligning with effects observed in RM-1 cells.
          In summary, CDCA regulates sebaceous lipid metabolism through multiple mechanisms, including altering fatty acid composition, modulating metabolic pathways, affecting mitochondrial function, and concurrently regulating AR expression. These findings underscore CDCA’s pivotal role in lipid metabolism regulation and its potential therapeutic value in treating lipid metabolism-related disorders.
        
      
    
    
      Discussion
      Lipid metabolism plays a central role in maintaining essential physiological processes such as cellular function, energy balance, and signal transduction. Dysregulation of lipid metabolism not only affects normal physiological functions but is also closely associated with the onset and progression of various diseases [11, 21, 22]. Recent studies have demonstrated that CDCA, a primary active component of bear bile, exhibits significant potential in regulating lipid metabolic disorders [20]. This study further investigated the role of CDCA in lipid metabolism regulation. The effects of CDCA on lipid metabolism were systematically examined using various cell models, including RM-1 cells, primary sebaceous gland cells, and in vivo experiments targeting the sebaceous gland area of golden hamsters. The results indicated that CDCA significantly inhibited lipid accumulation across these different cell and animal models, primarily by modulating fatty acid metabolism, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
      Initially, CDCA’s regulatory effects on lipids were validated using two cell lines. In RM-1 cells, CDCA significantly inhibited LA-induced lipid accumulation, exhibiting noticeable effects even at lower concentrations (IC10, 0.05 µmol/L), outperforming other bile acids such as UDCA. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that CDCA’s impact on RM-1 lipid metabolism was primarily focused on the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and energy metabolism. PCR and Western blot results indicate that CDCA significantly downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of key genes such as SREBF1, ACC, FASN, FADS1-3, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1). Inhibition of ACC and FASN directly affected de novo fatty acid synthesis, while downregulation of FADS and SCD1 might have reduced the production of unsaturated fatty acids, thereby influencing the composition of intracellular fatty acids. In primary sebaceous gland cells, lipidomics analysis further confirmed CDCA’s regulatory effects on fatty acid composition [23–25]. CDCA treatment significantly upregulated the content of various unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., LA, arachidonic acid) while inhibiting the expression of certain saturated fatty acids (e.g., palmitic acid). This regulation not only optimizes fatty acid composition but may also improve skin condition by increasing the proportion of anti-inflammatory fatty acids (e.g., LA).
      This study revealed the regulatory effects of CDCA on fatty acid metabolism and, for the first time, systematically explored its impact on energy metabolism and mitochondrial function. In RM-1 cells, a significant decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential was observed following CDCA treatment, suggesting that CDCA might have influenced the cellular energy metabolic state by regulating mitochondrial function. RNA-Seq analysis further supported this view, showing significant changes in energy metabolism-related pathways such as ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling after CDCA treatment. This aligns with recent research published in Nano Letters, which demonstrated that CDCA-loaded nanoparticles can reduce adipocyte size by inducing mitochondrial functions, including promoting β-oxidation [26]. Proteomic results from primary sebaceous gland cells also confirmed this conclusion, indicating that CDCA not only affects fatty acid metabolism but also significantly regulates processes related to mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation. This consistent effect across different cell types suggests that CDCA may influence energy metabolism and mitochondrial function through a universal mechanism, thereby regulating fatty acid metabolism and balance. Additionally, studies by Liu J et al. have shown that CDCA may promote lipid peroxidation by activating the ROS/p38 MAPK/DGAT1 axis and can directly bind to mitochondria, inducing mitochondrial changes in AML cells, including swelling and cristae reduction [27]. These findings complement previous discoveries and collectively reveal the multifaceted role of CDCA in regulating energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.
      Through RNA-Seq and proteomic analyses, several signaling pathways potentially involved in CDCA’s mechanism of action were identified. The AMPK signaling pathway was likely a key mechanism by which CDCA regulates lipid metabolism. Additionally, changes in TGF-β and FoxO signaling pathways suggested that CDCA may influence lipid metabolism by regulating cell differentiation and metabolism. Notably, CDCA’s impact on the GnRH signaling pathway was also observed, which may explain its regulatory effects on hormone-related lipid metabolism. In the experimental validation section, RM-1 cells were stimulated with DHT to induce AR overexpression, and CDCA was found to reduce AR expression as well. This indicates that CDCA can regulate hormone expression while modulating lipids, further confirming the close relationship between abnormal lipid accumulation and hormone levels.
      Comprehensive results indicated that CDCA exhibited bidirectional regulation of fatty acid metabolism. On one hand, it inhibits fatty acid synthesis by downregulating genes such as SREBF1 and ACC. On the other hand, Deep DIA analysis suggests that CDCA might promote fatty acid degradation by activating β-oxidation phosphorylation-related pathways. This bidirectional regulatory mechanism enabled CDCA to more precisely balance intracellular fatty acid levels; moreover, it can optimize fatty acid composition, providing a theoretical basis for its potential application in diseases related to lipid metabolic disorders.
      Based on the research findings and existing literature, CDCA emerged as a versatile regulator of lipid metabolism with promising therapeutic applications. In skin-related lipid metabolism disorders, CDCA may hold potential value in the treatment of acne and seborrheic alopecia. Observations in primary sebaceous gland cells indicate that CDCA suppresses lipid accumulation and optimizes fatty acid composition, providing direct evidence for its potential application in these conditions. By reducing sebum accumulation and increasing the proportion of anti-inflammatory fatty acids, CDCA may help alleviate acne symptoms [7, 28]. In the context of seborrheic alopecia, CDCA’s regulation of sebaceous gland activity could assist in controlling excessive oil accumulation. In diseases associated with lipid metabolism abnormalities, such as prostate cancer, CDCA’s potential role warrants attention. CDCA exhibited inhibitory effects on lipid metabolism and modulated AR expression in RM-1 prostate cancer cells, providing novel insights into its therapeutic potential for prostate cancer. CDCA may inhibit tumor cell growth and metastasis by modulating lipid metabolism and hormone signaling pathways [29–31].
      In summary, CDCA’s consistent effects across various cell models, its comprehensive regulation of lipid metabolism, and its impact on energy metabolism and mitochondrial function laid the foundation for its potential application in the treatment of multiple diseases. Future research should further explore CDCA’s mechanisms of action, optimize administration methods, and conduct preclinical and clinical studies to fully harness its potential in treating lipid metabolism-related diseases.
      
        Study strengths and limitations
        This study offers several important strengths. By integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and fatty acid-targeted metabolomics, a comprehensive and multi-layered understanding of how CDCA regulates lipid metabolism was established. This integrative approach was applied across RM-1 prostate cancer cells, primary sebaceous gland cells, and in vivo golden hamster models, ensuring both mechanistic depth and translational relevance. Notably, CDCA exhibited a bidirectional regulatory pattern—suppressing de novo fatty acid synthesis through SREBF1, ACC, and FASN, while simultaneously promoting fatty acid degradation pathways such as β-oxidation. The study also uncovered a previously underappreciated role of CDCA in mitochondrial regulation and energy metabolism, supported by consistent findings across multiple datasets and functional assays. Furthermore, the dual applicability of CDCA in both dermatological (acne and seborrheic disorders) and oncological (prostate cancer) settings broadens its therapeutic significance and opens up possibilities for cross-disciplinary interventions.
        Despite these contributions, several limitations should be acknowledged. The study did not clarify whether CDCA’s effects are mediated through canonical bile acid receptors such as FXR or TGR5, which could provide more targeted mechanistic insight. Although key signaling pathways like AMPK and MAPK were highlighted in the omics data, their involvement was not directly confirmed using pharmacological or genetic methods. Additionally, the in vivo validation was limited to the sebaceous gland model, while findings related to prostate cancer were based solely on in vitro assays, thus limiting their immediate clinical translation. Lastly, although CDCA is already used clinically, its long-term safety and toxicity profile, particularly in the context of topical or dermatological applications, remained to be evaluated. Future studies focusing on receptor mechanisms, pathway validation, and formulation safety will be essential to fully translate CDCA into therapeutic use.
      
    
    
      Conclusion
      CDCA demonstrates potential in modulating lipid metabolism by reducing lipid accumulation and reshaping fatty acid composition in RM-1 prostate cancer cells and sebaceous gland cells. It also influences mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, with in vivo validation confirming its regulatory effect on sebaceous gland homeostasis. These findings provide a foundation for developing novel, mechanism-based interventions to address sebaceous and metabolic disorders in a more targeted and sustainable manner. Further studies are warranted to optimize delivery strategies and comprehensively assess the safety and translational potential of CDCA for long-term therapeutic use.

Title: Lipid-Based Nanocarriers
for Topical Therapy of Cutaneous
Leishmaniasis: An Insight into the Mechanism of Action

Abstract: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a parasitic infection
caused by
Leishmania species, affecting millions worldwide. The current treatment
options for CL have several limitations, including low efficacy, inability
to reach the target site, potential toxicity, and longer treatment
duration, leading to poor patient compliance. Therefore, there is
an urgent need for alternative treatments, especially topical ones,
that are more effective, safe, and patient-friendly. Although numerous
reviews have described the advantages of a wide range of nanoparticles
in the treatment of CL, this review narrows its focus to the utilization
of novel lipid-based nanocarriers for the topical treatment of CL,
offering an in-depth analysis of the topical potential and mechanism
of skin permeation of these lipidic nanocarriers. Lipid-based nanostructures
such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanostructured lipid
carriers have been extensively studied for CL treatment, either alone
or in combination with other drugs or therapies. These carriers can
improve the bioavailability, stability, and efficacy of the drug,
target the infected site, and reduce adverse effects on healthy tissues.
Moreover, these can be easily formulated into different dosage forms,
such as creams, gels, or ointments, for convenient topical application.
Despite the many benefits of lipid-based carriers, there are still
some challenges that need to be addressed, such as optimizing the
formulation parameters, ensuring the reproducibility and scalability
of the process, and evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy in
clinical trials. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview
of the current state-of-the-art lipid-based nanocarriers for topical
treatment of CL, covering the recent advances, limitations, clinical
evidence, and prospects of this promising approach. In addition, the
skin and macrophage targeting potential of various lipid-based nanocarriers
is also discussed, which is especially helpful in treating the lesions
of CL.

Body: Introduction
      
        Overview of Leishmaniasis
        Leishmaniasis is a term used
for the group of diseases that are caused by the bite of phlebotomine
sandflies. The disease typically shows three types of patterns in
infected individuals, i.e., cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral
Leishmaniasis. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis,
the most common form of the disease, is categorized into localized
cutaneous Leishmaniasis (LCL), diffuse cutaneous Leishmaniasis (DCL),
and mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis (MCL) depending on the area of the
body involved. Visceral Leishmaniasis involves the transfer of parasites
into the vital organs and is the most severe form of the disease. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis is an endemic disease
in more than 70 countries of the world (1.5 million new cases each
year), with 90% of cases reported in Pakistan, India, Ethiopia, Brazil,
Afghanistan, Peru, and Saudi Arabia. The
reported number of cases, especially coinfection with human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV), is increasing globally each year. According to WHO, up
to 70% of cases of VL are reported in adults having coinfection with
HIV in southern Europe.

      
      
        Life Cycle and Clinical Symptoms of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis
        When an infected sand fly bites the host, it transfers promastigotes
into the skin, which are phagocytosed by host cells, mainly macrophages.
Once inside the phagolysosomes of macrophages, promastigotes develop
into amastigotes, which infect further macrophages present locally
or at distant sites. The leishmania cycle is completed when an otherwise
healthy sand fly bites an infected host, leading to the transfer of
amastigotes. These amastigotes subsequently transform into promastigotes
in the sand fly’s gut and the parasite is ultimately migrated
into proboscis.
Figure 
 represents the stages of the lifecycle of
the Leishmania parasite.

        Most infections with Leishmania species remain
symptomless, and where the symptoms appear,
the first sign
is usually erythema at the site of the bite. The characteristic lesion
of LCL is developed after erythema develops into a nodule and then
a papule, which ulcerates over 2 weeks to 6 months. These lesions vary in size, appearance, and the time they
take to cure spontaneously. Time to cure depends on the species of
Leishmania involved, e.g., in the case of L. major, the lesion takes 2–6 months to heal, whereas in the case of L. mexicanaand L. tropica
, they
take 3–9 and 6–15 months, respectively.

various changes that may occur in the skin throughout the disease,
including ulcerative and scaly lesions.

            Various skin changes
may occur during the course of the disease
of CL. (A) Intact skin was treated with stratum corneum, viable epidermis,
and dermis. (B) Lesion characterized by partial damage to the skin,
stratum corneum barrier function is lost, and dermis filled with infected
macrophages. (C) Ulcerative lesion characterized by loss of stratum
corneum and epidermis, fewer macrophages, and increased inflammatory
mediators (created in BioRender; Riaz, A. (2025) https://BioRender.com/in2fttn).
          
          
        
      
      
        Current Treatment and Hurdles/Challenges
        In addition
to intrinsic activity, the arrival of active drug ingredients at the
site of action and therapeutic concentration is equally important
for efficacy. In the case of cutaneous Leishmaniasis, the target is
infected macrophages that reside in the deeper layer of skin, i.e.,
dermis. The main reason for the insufficient efficacy of topical treatment
is the difficulty for active ingredients to cross the stratum corneum
barrier of the skin and to overcome rapid systemic clearance once
they reach the dermis. Further, various skin lesion patterns ranging
from nodules and scales to ulcers throughout the disease also significantly
affect drug absorption from topical sites. Therefore, the design of intelligent new formulations and the discovery
of new potential targets are required to overcome the aforementioned
problems.
        
Table 
 shows various treatment options for CL, which include parenteral,
oral, intralesional, and topical therapy. Pentavalent antimonials,
including sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate, are the
first-line treatments for any form of Leishmaniasis. They were given
parenterally as well as in the form of intralesional injections. However,
research data shows no significant difference in the efficacy of one
over the other. Other drugs that are
being used include Amphotericin B and its liposomal formulation Ambisome,
paromomycin, miltefosine, buparvaquone, and the immunomodulator drug
imiquimod. Several repurposed drugs,
including azole antifungals, antiparasitic, anticancer, antibiotics,
and antihypertensives, were found to be effective against the promastigotes
and/or amastigotes of various species of Leishmania. These drugs and potential targets for drug repurposing are an extensive
research area and have been reviewed in detail previously. The readers
are referred to these reviews for further study on the repurposing
of drugs to discover potential new drugs with antileishmanial activities.
,
 In addition, several herbal systems and oils derived from plants
were found to be effective against various Leishmania species in vitro and in vivo. One such oil, Annatto oil, derived from the
plant Bixa orellana has demonstrated
the antileishmanial potential in vitro and diseased
animal models when administered intraperitoneally. Various medicinal plants, including Almond, Thyme, Aloe,
Garlic, and Marigold, were scientifically proven to be effective in
treating lesions of CL and reducing the parasite burden. The uncomplicated cases may be treated without
requiring hospital admission, but frequent visits to health care centers
are required. However, these therapies are far from being satisfactory
because of the emergence of resistance, associated side effects, high
cost, and challenges in reaching the target site, i.e., infected macrophages. For uncomplicated LCL, local therapy in the
form of topical or intralesional administration is practiced routinely.
Topical therapy is always superior to intralesional injections in
terms of patient compliance, as there is no associated pain or anxiety.
However, research data shows that the intralesional antimonials are
more effective and have lower recurrence rates as compared to conventional
topical creams.

        Approaches to Improve Dermal Drug Accumulation
        Major
strategies that are commonly used to improve dermal drug accumulation
include occlusive effects, supersaturation, the use of permeation
enhancers, and novel drug delivery systems. Skin occlusion has long been used in dermatology to increase the
penetration of topically applied medicaments and to improve wound
healing. Occlusive dressing helps increase the retention time of ointments
or other drug delivery systems on the skin and prevents early removal
by protecting the skin against scratching and rubbing. However, the main reason for the increase in
penetration of topically applied substances is shown to be an increase
in the level of hydration of the stratum corneum (SC) under occlusion.
This increased hydration disrupts the ultrastructure of the SC lipid
barrier, thereby increasing the skin permeability.

        Various compounds from different chemical classes
have been suggested as chemical penetration enhancers, including surfactants,
lipids, and other hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds (DMSO, propylene
glycol, and ethanol). These compounds affect SC barrier properties
and increase the permeability of active compounds through various
mechanisms affecting both protein and lipid components of the stratum
corneum. In contrast to previous methods
to enhance permeability, supersaturation does not require alteration
of the physicochemical properties of the skin barrier. In a supersaturated
system, drug molecules are dispersed in a vehicle in amounts higher
than their solubility, thereby imparting a high thermodynamic activity,
which leads to enhanced skin permeability. However, these supersaturated systems may lead to drug crystallization
over time because of thermodynamic instability.
        Conventional
drug delivery systems that are being used topically
for the treatment of CL include creams, ointments, and hydrophilic
gels. Application of nanotechnology to the field of topical drug delivery
has provided new horizons to the treatment of skin disorders. Various types of nanoparticles have been used
for improvement in drug delivery, either at dermal or transdermal
levels.
Figure 
 shows possible mechanisms by which lipid
nanoparticles can target deeper skin layers and enhance skin localization.
These novel drug delivery systems serve the purpose through various
mechanisms, which include improvement in the solubility of poorly
soluble drugs, enhanced skin penetration through SC, and provision
of sustained drug release. These mechanisms account for an increased
amount of the drug available at various skin layers and sustained
drug release only at the target topical site, thereby minimizing systemic
absorption and related side effects. Dermis
targeting can be improved by surface modification with ligands or
peptides that bind to skin-specific receptors or components. Various
classes of nanoparticles that have been explored for their potential
to improve drug delivery for the treatment of CL include lipid nanoparticles,
such as liposomes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), nanostructured
lipid carriers (NLCs), polymeric nanoparticles, and metallic nanoparticles,
such as silver (Ag) and nanoparticles of metal oxides (titanium, silicon,
and zinc oxides).

        While other reviews have explored a variety of
nanoparticles (metallic,
polymeric, lipidic, etc.) in treating either visceral or cutaneous
leishmaniasis,
−

 there is very limited literature available regarding
a specific focus on lipid-based nanocarriers, especially in the context
of topical applications. This review aims to fill that literature
gap by concentrating on the efforts made for the development of novel
lipid-based drug delivery systems for the delivery of antileishmanial
agents for topical treatment of CL. First, we will discuss the general
overview of various types of lipid-based nanocarriers and the possible
advantages that these lipid-based nanosystems offer over other types
of nanocarriers. We then discuss the possible mechanism of action
of each class of lipid-based nanoparticles and their topical potential
in detail. We then conclude with the application of lipid-based nanoparticles
for the treatment of CL.
      
      
        Advantages of Lipid-Based Colloidal Carriers for Topical Application
        Colloidal drug delivery systems have revolutionized the medical
field since their introduction. They have been studied to overcome
the problems associated with conventional systems, e.g., improved
solubility of poorly soluble drugs, reduction in associated side effects,
and improved therapeutic index. They
are broadly categorized into two main categories, i.e., polymer-based
and lipid-based colloidal systems, depending on the type of material
used in their fabrication. The main advantages
of lipid-based nanocarriers over other types of nanoparticles (polymeric,
metallic) include the biocompatible and biodegradable nature of lipids, lower toxicity, loading of hydrophobic drugs, codelivery
of hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, easy scale-up, enhanced flux across
skin layers, and finally controlled drug
release. Emulsion polymerization is a type of radical polymerization
that usually starts with an emulsion incorporating water, a monomer,
and a surfactant. It is the most common method of production for polymeric
nanoparticles, which involves the use of potentially toxic cross-linkers
and monomers that are difficult to remove completely at the end of
the process. Another problem is the lack
of cost-effective and suitable methods for the production of polymeric
nanoparticles on a large scale. Lipid-based colloidal carriers were
introduced mainly to overcome the toxicity issues of polymeric nanoparticles,
as they are mainly composed of safe and well-tolerated excipients.
Furthermore, their production can be undertaken on a large scale easily,
which is a prerequisite for the successful entrance of any drug delivery
system into the market. They can be produced on a large scale using
various techniques: high-pressure homogenization, ultrasonication,
spray drying, and coacervation. Research efforts have been oriented
toward lipidic systems, including liposomes, nanoemulsions, and lipid
nanoparticles (SLNs and NLCs), which will be described further in
detail. Figure 
 represents
each class of lipid nanoparticles that has been explored for dermal
drug delivery of antileishmanial agents.

        Liposomes
        
          Potential of Liposomes in Topical Drug Delivery and Possible
Mechanism of Action
          Liposomes are nanostructured lipid vesicles
that are composed of multiple lipid bilayers (mostly phospholipids)
enclosing an aqueous shell. They provide
many advantages when employed as a topical drug delivery vehicle,
including their nontoxicity, biodegradability, and ability to encapsulate
both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs in the same package. Many methods have been reported in the literature
for the production of liposomes, which are beyond the scope of this
review, and readers may follow these references for details on manufacturing
methods. Liposomes are especially significant
for topical drug delivery because they can provide targeted drug delivery
to various skin strata and reduce systemic drug absorption, therefore
minimizing side effects. Modifying liposome size, surface charge,
and chemical composition targets specific skin layers. Liposomes made
of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) were among the first to be
employed for topical drug delivery. Later,
many researchers reported the ability of liposomes to localize in
SC and deeper skin layers and suggested the usefulness of liposomes
for dermal drug delivery.

          There
may be many possible mechanisms that can explain enhanced cutaneous
drug delivery when the drug is encapsulated in liposomes. The first
concept focuses on the penetration of intact vesicles as a possible
mechanism of enhanced skin accumulation. This hypothesis is supported
by the fact that small unilamellar vesicles resulted in better accumulation
of aqueous radiolabeled inulin in deeper skin layers as compared to
larger-sized multilamellar vesicles, suggesting a role of particle
size on skin deposition. Another mechanism
suggested liposomes as penetration enhancers, in which liposomal lipids
adhere to the skin surface, alter the lipid structure of SC, and penetrate
the SC by disrupting and merging with the lipid matrix. This interaction
depends on lipid composition, and the penetration-enhancing effect
of liposomes has been demonstrated by many researchers. These lipid-based
delivery systems can interact and fuse with the SC’s intercellular
lipids. Because they are not as dense as SC, they can pass through
sweat glands and hair follicles. They can be made to release the medication
in a regulated way, which would lengthen the medication’s half-life
in the skin and boost its effectiveness.
,


        
        
          Conventional Liposomes for Treatment of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis
          All aforementioned properties of liposomes suggest them as a favorable
candidate for the topical treatment of CL. Liposomal formulation of
antileishmanial drugs (amphotericin B, stibogluconate, miltefosine,
and paromomycin) has been used systemically to cure lesions of CL,
which showed superior efficacy as compared to free drug or control
groups. One group of researchers showed
the potential of liposomes containing meglumine antimoniate (MA) to
be taken up by macrophages infected with L. major more effectively as compared to free MA. Results of in vitro antileishmanial assay against amastigotes demonstrated that the
MA-loaded liposomes resulted in lower IC50 values and were
≥ 10-fold more effective compared to free MA. The results of
the macrophage uptake study, as determined by fluorescence microscopy,
demonstrated that fluorescently labeled liposomes were taken up by
infected macrophages (>80%) only after 10 min of incubation, with
100% of the cells showing fluorescence after 1 h. However, these studies
demonstrated efficacy only in vitro, and further in vivo studies were suggested to confirm the efficacy of
MA liposomes.

          A preclinical study
demonstrated the efficacy of paromomycin sulfate (PM) loaded liposomes
(LPMFs) in L. major-infected BALB/c
mice. Liposomes containing different
concentrations of paromomycin (10 and 15%) were synthesized by a fusion
method. The skin permeation study for prepared formulations was conducted in vitro using mouse skin and a Franz diffusion cell, where
results demonstrated that for both formulations, almost 60% of LPMFs
were retained on the skin, and about 15% penetrated the skin. Topical
application of LPMFs on lesions of infected BALB/c mice twice a day
showed significantly smaller lesion size as compared to the control
group, and a complete cure was achieved after 8 weeks. They proposed
liposomes containing PM as promising carriers for the topical treatment
of CL. The potential of PM-loaded liposomes for topical delivery was
also evaluated by other researchers. Large
multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) and large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs)
were prepared by solvent evaporation and reverse-phase evaporation
methods, respectively. Skin permeation experiments across normal and
stripped skin demonstrated the controlled topical delivery of paromomycin
for LUVs liposomes. Almost similar findings were reported in another
study where liposomes enhanced the penetration of the drug across
stripped skin in vitro and better antileishmanial
activity in infected mice in vivo. Two types of liposomal
vesicles were prepared using phosphatidylcholine (PC) alone or from
a PC/cholesterol combination to encapsulate paromomycin (PA). The
permeation of PM across intact skin was higher for liposomal formulations
(7.2 ± 0.2% for PC and 4.8 ± 0.2% for PC/Chol) compared
to the drug solution (1.9 ± 0.1%). The permeation of PM from
liposomal formulations was also higher (20 times for PC and 10 times
for PC/Chol) compared to the drug solution across the stripped skin.
The results of the in vivo study on BALB/c mice infected
with L. major also demonstrated superior
efficacy of liposomal formulations compared to the drug solution in
terms of relapse rate. By day 64, 50% of animals showed relapse in
the PA solution-treated group, whereas the percentage of animals showing
relapse in the liposomal formulation-treated group was only 10%. At
the end of the study period, cure rates were demonstrated to be 0%
for PA solution and 30% for liposomal PA.

          In yet another study, liposomes were used to encapsulate amphotericin
B (AmB) for topical application to treat CL. In this study, two types of liposomes were prepared: liposomal AmB
formulation and PEGylated liposomal AmB formulation. The efficacy
of prepared formulations was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo, and results confirmed the drug-containing
liposomal formulations to be more potent compared to standard AmB.
Further, it was demonstrated that the addition of PEG in liposomes
improved the antileishmanial efficacy in vivo in
BALB/c mice in reducing the parasite burden by 1.6 fold and lesion
size by 1.7 fold compared to nonPEGylated liposomal formulations.
Compared to free AmB, the PEGylated liposomal AmB formulation demonstrated
a decrease in lesion size by 5.9-fold and parasite burden by 2.5-fold.
This improved efficacy of PEGylated liposomes was attributed to the
smaller size compared to nonPEGylated liposomes, as smaller particles
penetrate the target cells more efficiently.
          Another possibility
that can improve the efficacy of drug-loaded
liposomes is the active targeting of nanocarriers to the diseased
site. Most of the research in the area of treatment of CL using nanomedicines
has utilized the passive targeting of nanocarriers to infected macrophages,
especially in the case of topical drug delivery. Active targeting involves the surface modification of lipid
nanocarriers using various ligands or antibodies that can specifically
recognize the receptors on the target cells and thus enhance the uptake.
Macrophages, the main target in the topical treatment of CL, contain
many receptors that can be targeted to enhance the uptake of nanocarriers,
including opsonic receptors (CD11b & CD44). Hyaluronic acid (HA),
a glycosaminoglycan naturally produced in our body, can be recognized
by CD44 and other HA receptors in macrophages. In one attempt, liposomes were coated with hyaluronic acid
(HA), and when compared with noncoated liposomes, the former improved
the antileishmanial activity of the entrapped active ingredient. These
HA-containing liposomes were also able to penetrate deeper skin layers
when applied topically and were proposed as a potential topical drug
delivery system for the treatment of CL. The results of the skin permeation
study demonstrated higher retention of loaded drug in the epidermis
(0.69 ± 0.05 and 0.23 ± 0.07 for surface-coated liposomes
compared to controls, where no drug could be quantified in deeper
skin layers). In another study, the surface
of cationic liposomes was modified with covalently attached p-aminophenyl-α-D-mannoside
for the delivery of AmB. The results of the in vivo study in golden hamsters infected by L. donovani demonstrated superior antileishmanial activity in the case of mannose-coupled
cationic liposomes, where a maximum reduction in the parasite load
was observed compared to liposomes without any surface modification.
The parasite burden was reduced by 42.5 ± 1.8, 61.2 ± 3.2,
and 78.8 ± 3.9% in the case of AmB solution, AmB-loaded cationic
liposomes, and AmB-loaded mannose-coupled liposomes, respectively. Overall, the active targeting of nanocarriers
to infected macrophages seems to be a promising new area that requires
further exploration, as limited research articles are available on
this topic.
        
        
          Ultradeformable Liposomes in Treatment of CL
          To further
improve the skin permeation properties, the next generation of conventional
liposomes was developed, which have some useful properties like flexibility
and ultradeformability. These include transfersomes and ethosomes
that incorporate some useful alterations in the composition of traditional
liposomes. Transfersomes are composed of phospholipids and contain
single-chain surfactants as edge activators (tween, span, and sodium
cholate), which destabilize vesicular lipid bilayers and make them
highly deformable and elastic. This feature enables Transfersomes
to squeeze through intercellular regions of the SC and improve skin
permeation properties. They were reported to penetrate the skin in vivo with an efficacy comparable to subcutaneous administration.
In a recent study, trifluralin-loaded transferosomes were evaluated
for their targeted delivery to dermal skin layers and macrophages.
Prepared drug-loaded transferosomes demonstrated superior in vitro efficacy against L. tropica promastigotes (3.07 fold reduction in IC50) and amastigotes
(2.86 fold reduction in IC50) as well as a higher macrophage
penetration compared to the drug solution. The results of this study
demonstrated transferosomes as suitable candidates for cutaneous applications.

          Ethosomes contain phospholipids plus a
high concentration (20–50%) of ethanol, which is a well-known
permeation enhancer. The incorporation of ethanol provides the vesicles
with a soft, flexible, and fluid nature, which allows them to penetrate
deeper skin layers. Nanoethosomal formulations of amphotericin B were
prepared by the mechanical dispersion method for the treatment of
fungal skin infections. They proposed
a nanoethosomal formulation as a promising carrier for topical skin
delivery of AmB. Similarly, AmB-loaded ultradeformable liposomes were
developed for the treatment of cutaneous fungal and leishmanial infections. These ultradeformable liposomes showed 75% and
100% L. braziliensis amastigotes and
promastigotes activity, respectively, at a concentration of 1.25 μg/mL.
A 40 times higher accumulation of the drug in human skin was reported
for the prepared ultradeformable liposomal formulation as compared
to Ambisome after 1 h of incubation in the absence of any occlusion.
AmBisome is a marketed liposomal formulation of amphotericin B, which
is antileishmanial and an antifungal drug. Figure 
 compares the structure of liposomes and
ultradeformable liposomes as well as the possible mechanism of skin
permeation for ultradeformable liposomes.

        Lipid Nanoparticles
        
          Potential of Lipid Nanoparticles in Topical Drug Delivery and
Possible Mechanism of Action
          Both Solid lipid nanoparticles
(SLNs) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) have numerous potential
features that are valuable for dermal drug applications. First, they
are colloidal drug carriers that provide sustained drug release at
the site of application, and second, they are composed of biological
lipids that ensure excellent tolerability and safety. Their small
size results in enhanced contact with SC, which increases the amount
of drug that penetrates into the skin layers. However, the most important
property of lipid nanoparticles that provides improved drug accumulation
in the skin is their potential to cause skin occlusion. Occlusion
causes increased skin hydration due to reduced water loss from the
skin, as described earlier.

          The
occlusive potential of lipid nanoparticles of various sizes was studied
at in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo levels. Formulation based on SLNs resulted in thicker
SC, and it has the potential to be used as an effective skin moisturizer.
SLN-based formulations demonstrated excellent skin tolerability and
were proposed as promising dermal drug delivery systems. Another interesting feature of lipid nanoparticles
is their ability to target different skin strata. Various researchers
have shown the potential of lipid nanoparticles to target skin layers,
which is particularly beneficial for topical drug delivery in the
treatment of different skin conditions. Skin targeting improves drug
accumulation in specific layers and at the same time avoids excessive
drug absorption into the blood.
,
 Another interesting
study prepared tacrolimus-loaded lipid
nanoparticles (T-LN) for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD).
These nanoparticles were able to provide targeting and increased drug
accumulation at epidermal and dermal layers, where immune-inflammatory
cells responsible for AD are present. In vitro drug
release and skin permeation properties were investigated using pig
ear skin and compared with those of the marketed ointment. Confocal
laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was used to confirm the results of in vivo skin uptake. Results of the in vivo cutaneous uptake study demonstrated higher drug levels (3.36, 28.68,
and 30.81 times in the stratum corneum, dermis, and epidermis, respectively)
as compared to the available marketed ointment.
          The mechanism
of skin permeation and targeting of lipid nanoparticles
largely remains unclear and requires a thorough investigation. However,
it is clear that drug release from SLNs and NLCs largely depends on
manufacturing conditions and process parameters. Various formulation
parameters, such as lipid composition, lipid ratios, and manufacturing
methods, can be finely tuned to achieve drug penetration and targeting
control. Both burst release and sustained release can be obtained
using lipid nanoparticles, while sustained drug delivery only in the
skin strata for longer periods is most desirable for topical drugs.
There may be many possible mechanisms for SLNs and NLCs to permeate
the skin. For instance, intact lipid nanoparticles can permeate SC
if they are of a very small size. However, in most cases, they accumulate
in gland ducts, appendageal openings, and hair follicles of the skin,
with smaller sizes showing higher accumulation. This would be ideal
for treating cases of cutaneous Leishmaniasis where sustained therapeutic
drug concentration is required in the dermis, which is the site of
infected macrophages.
,
 In other cases, lipid nanoparticles
simply act as a controlled drug delivery vehicle and remain on the
outer skin surface, allowing only the drug to partition and permeate
the skin. Another possible mechanism is that both drug and lipid molecules
from SLNs permeate the skin independently and the interaction of skin
lipids and lipids from SLNs forms a lipophilic reservoir region for
lipophilic drugs, which will increase the residence time of such drugs
in the skin.

        
        
          Lipid Nanoparticles for Treatment of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis
          Although relatively less work has been done in the area of topical
treatment of CL, both SLNs and NLC lipid nanoparticles showed promising
enhancement in efficacy when antileishmanial drugs were loaded and
tested against visceral Leishmaniasis.
−


 Many researchers prepared drug-loaded
SLNs by conventional methods, and the results of these studies proposed
that the prepared drug delivery systems have the potential to be used
as a treatment for Leishmaniasis, owing to easy scale-up feasibility,
low cost of fabricating materials, and efficacy compared to polymeric
nanoparticles. However, these studies did not cover many aspects,
such as in vitro and in vivo performance,
and were unable to provide experimental evidence of efficacy against
either VL or CL. Other studies provided
proof of the in vitro efficacy of prepared lipid
nanoparticle formulations against various Leishmanial strains and
demonstrated a significant reduction in EC50 values compared
to nonformulated drugs.
,


          Despite the tremendous
potential of lipid nanoparticles for topical application and skin
targeting for CL, very little work has been done in the area. Keeping
this in view, our research group prepared topical drug-loaded NLCs-based
gel to treat lesions of CL. Prepared drug-loaded NLC formulations
showed significant targeting potential to deeper skin layers as well
as macrophages. Encapsulation of amphotericin&nbsp;
B (AmB) in NLCs demonstrated a significant reduction in IC50 values in vitro, against L. major promastigotes (105 μg/mL) and amastigotes (190 μg/mL),
compared to free AmB (IC50 values of 243 μg/mL for
amastigotes and 165 μg/mL for promastigotes). Finally, AmB-loaded
NLCs demonstrated a significant drop in parasite load per mg of the
lesion compared to free AmB and the control group when tested topically
on L. major-infected mice. Our studies suggested NLCs as promising drug
delivery carriers for topical treatment of skin conditions where targeting
is required for deeper skin layers. Encouraging in vitro results motivated us to evaluate the potential of NLCs in treating
lesions of CL in vivo. For this purpose, AmB-loaded
NLCs were prepared, and efficacy was evaluated and compared to free
AmB solution in vitro and in vivo. Results of in vitro antileishmanial assays demonstrated
a significant reduction in IC50 values against promastigotes
(0.02 ± 0.1 μM) and amastigotes (0.02 ± 0.1 μM)
of L. major compared to free AmB solution
(0.15 ± 0.2 μM for promastigotes and 0.14 ± 0.0 μM
for amastigotes). Results of in vivo evaluation on BALB/c mice demonstrated
that topically applied NLCs significantly reduced the parasite burden
in the treatment group (65 × 108 ± 13 per mg
of the lesion) compared to control (>167.8 × 108 ±
11 per mg of the lesion) and free AmB solution (>145.4 ± 18).
These results demonstrated the topical potential of NLCs in treating
the lesions of CL.

        
      
      
        Lipidic Nanoemulsions
        
          Potential of Nanoemulsions in Topical Drug Delivery
          Nanoemulsions have tremendous potential in the topical delivery of
medicaments owing to the following advantages: higher drug loading,
lower skin toxicity, improved skin hydration, and permeation enhancement
of drugs. Shakeel et al.

 conducted a study to
gain insight into the skin permeation mechanism of a transdermally
applied celecoxib nanoemulsion. Results of their experiments confirmed
that nanoemulsion caused the extraction of lipids of SC, and significant
disruption of the lipid bilayer was observed. Photomicrograph images
showed voids and empty spaces in the epidermis caused by nanoemulsion
application. Similar results were reported by the same researchers
for the drug aceclofenac, where they proposed lipid extraction of
SC as the main mechanism of drug permeation after the application
of nanoemulsion.

          Amphotericin B-loaded
nanoemulsion was synthesized as a cost-effective and efficacious alternative
drug delivery system to liposomes for topical drug delivery. Different oil/water nanoemulsions were prepared,
which contained varying concentrations of surfactant (Tween 80) and
cosurfactant (PEG-400). These formulations were characterized, and
skin permeation from optimized formulations (F-1, F–III, and
F–VI) was compared with commercially available gel (Fungisome
0.1%). The ex vivo skin permeation study demonstrated
enhanced skin permeation (1.85-fold higher than fungisome and 3.0-fold
higher than the drug solution) and skin deposition (2.11-fold higher
than fungisome) from the optimized nanoemulsion. They proposed the
synthesized nanocarrier as a safe and economical topical treatment
for fungal skin infections. Another study proposed nanoemulsion (NE)
and nanoemulsion-based gel of amphotericin B (AmB-NE gel) for local
skin delivery. All prepared formulations exhibited superior and statistically
significant (p ≤ 0.001) antifungal activity
as compared to reference drugs as well as a higher skin permeation
flux rate in the case of NE (15.74 ± 0.4 μg/cm2/h) and AmB-NE gel (18.09 ± 0.6 μg/cm2/h) compared
to free drug solution (4.59 ± 0.01 μg/cm2/h). Although these studies were not conducted on
Leishmanial strains, these formulations have the potential to be used
against CL owing to their skin-targeting potential in deeper layers.
        
        
          Nanoemulsions for Treatment of CL
          Chalcones are lipophilic
compounds that have shown potential for the treatment of CL. Nanoemulsions
containing synthetic chalcone were prepared and optimized for skin
permeation and retention. Their results
demonstrated that a formulation composed of polysorbate 20 and soybean
lecithin showed good physicochemical properties and the highest dermal
retention (3.03 μg g–1). Targeting and distribution
into the dermis were also confirmed by confocal fluorescence microscopy.
Results of the antileishmanial assay against strains of Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes proved that the
optimized formulation retained antileishmanial activity after 60 days.
They suggested soybean lecithin and polysorbate 20-based nanoemulsion
as a suitable alternative for the topical treatment of CL. Some other
studies also demonstrated the potential of microemulsion and nanoemulsion
in the treatment of CL.
,,
 However, these studies did not prove any superior in vivo efficacy, in contrast to marketed products. An interesting study
where the topical potential of nanoemulsions was demonstrated in vivo to treat lesions of CL was undertaken by researchers. Nanoemulsion containing natural oils, extracted
from P. emarginatus fruits (SO-NE),
was prepared and employed in the topical treatment of CL. Results
of the treatment on infected animals demonstrated a significant reduction
of lesion sizes in the case of nanoemulsion (7.3 ± 0.8–5.6
± 1.5 mm) compared to when oils were applied without formulation
(6.7 ± 1.5–6.8 ± 1.6 mm). This study proposed topical
nanoemulsion in combination with other standard treatments as a suitable
drug delivery system for the topical treatment of CL.
        
      
      
        Other Lipid Nanocarriers for Topical Treatment of CL
        Nanocochleates are another phospholipid-based system that is formed
when negatively charged phospholipid bilayers are bridged using mostly
calcium ions. These cigar-like nanostructures offer the advantages
of increased stability, safety, and easy production. There are a few
reports where nanocochleates have been used to improve the efficacy
of antileishmanial drugs for the treatment of either visceral or cutaneous
Leishmaniasis. The intralesional administration of nanocochleates
containing essential oil from the plant Artemisia absinthium L. (EO-Aa-NC) demonstrated superior antileishmanial activity compared
to control (nonformulated EO-Aa) by 50% in the BALB/c model of CL. The animals were allocated to five groups postinfection,
with each group containing eight animals. One group did not receive
any treatment, whereas the remaining four groups received intralesional
EO-Aa, EO-Aa-NC, blank NC, and standard treatment Glucantime. Results
of the in vivo study demonstrated that EO-Aa-NC was
as effective as the standard drug Glucantime, whereas it also significantly
reduced the lesion sizes (p < 0.05) compared to
nonformulated EO-Aa and controls. Similarly, oral administration of
amphotericin B-loaded nanocochleate formulation resulted in a higher
accumulation of drugs in the organs (spleen and liver) of interest
compared to the liposomal amphotericin B. There is limited literature that validates the topical potential
of nanocochleates in treating skin diseases, although one report demonstrated
the superior efficacy and stability of drug-loaded nanocochleates
compared to liposomes for treating skin conditions. Given these encouraging results, nanocochleate formulations
should also be investigated to enhance the antileishmanial efficacy
when administered via the topical route for the treatment of CL.
        Lipid-core nanocapsules (LNCs) are composed of a lipidic core that
is surrounded by a polymeric envelope (usually biodegradable polycaprolactone).
Encapsulating the active ingredients in LNCs confers protection from
the external environment as well as provides a way to control the
drug release. There are few reports of
utilizing LNCs to improve the topical delivery of antileishmanial
drugs. In one study, lipid-core nanocapsules were used to entrap antileishmanial
chalcone (CH8) to analyze the topical potential of this nanocarrier
in reducing the parasite burden in mice infected with L. amazonensis. Rhodamine-labeled LNCs were also
prepared (Rho-LNC–CH8) to study macrophage uptake, and results
demonstrated that Rho-LNC–CH8 were internalized by infected
macrophages within 15 min. Results demonstrated that after 3 weeks
of topical application every day, LNCs containing CH8 significantly
reduced the parasite burden (86%) compared to the free CH8, which
was ineffective. This improved efficacy was attributed to the efficient
permeation of LNCs into the mouse skin as well as macrophage targeting
of lipidic nanocarriers. Another study
demonstrated significantly enhanced antileishmanial efficacy of quercetin
(Qc) when encapsulated in LNCs compared to free Qc, after oral administration
in the BALB/c mice infected with L. amazonensis. The results from these studies demonstrate the potential of LNCs
that should be explored further in the topical therapy of CL.
      
      
        Controversies in Skin Permeation and Deposition of Lipid-Based
Nanocarriers
        The exact mechanism of skin permeation and deposition
of lipid-based nanocarriers is still not clear and requires further
investigation. Many studies reported the effect of particle size,
composition, and surfactant type on skin permeation and localization
potential, with smaller sizes showing better penetration compared
to larger ones. Stratum corneum, being
negatively charged, acts as a barrier to the passage of the anionic
nanocarriers. Conversely, cationic nanocarriers will interact and
accumulate, preferably in superficial layers. Therefore, neutral lipids
are preferred to enhance skin permeation and deposition. The particle size of nanocarriers also depends
on surfactant type, with certain surfactants producing smaller sizes
compared to others. However, the exact
mechanism behind this effect remains unclear and needs further investigation.
Some conflicting evidence suggests that these nanocarriers largely
remain in superficial skin layers and mainly act as reservoirs of
loaded drugs to provide a sustained release rather than penetration
to deeper layers To address these inconsistencies,
Standardized methodologies in conducting skin permeation/deposition
studies, both in vitro and in vivo, and advanced imaging techniques
to accurately assess skin penetration are required.
      
      
        Safety and Efficacy of Lipid-Based Nanocarriers for Topical
Application: Clinical Evidence
        There are a limited number
of clinical studies available on the topical application of lipid-based
nanocarriers in the treatment of CL lesions. Table 
 summarizes the study design, lipid-nanocarrier-based
formulation type, and key findings of available clinical trials specifically
conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lipid-based nanoformulations
in topical drug delivery to treat CL lesions.

        Currently, the lesions of CL are treated with either
intralesional
injections or systemic administration of drugs including liposomal
AmB as presented in Table 
. Topical therapy is used conventionally as an adjunct to
systemic therapy because topical therapy with traditional formulations
alone is unable to produce a satisfactory clinical response due to
several challenges mentioned earlier in the manuscript. Lipid-based
nanocarriers have demonstrated promising results for topical application,
either alone or in combination with intralesional therapy, both in vitro and at the preclinical level. Among lipid-based
nanocarriers, liposomal formulations are already approved for systemic
administration to treat both visceral and CL. However, clinical trials
specifically for topical application for treating the lesions of CL
were only found for liposomes and are summarized in Table 
. Results from these clinical
trials demonstrated that topical application of liposomes containing
antileishmanial drugs, whether alone or in combination with standard
therapies, was safe and highly effective in reducing the lesion size
and severity of ulceration and induration. One study demonstrated
that topical azithromycin alone produced results comparable to those
of intralesional glucantime (standard therapy), highlighting the potential
of topical application that can be used as a standalone treatment
for self-limiting cases of CL, eliminating the need for systemic therapy.
In another study, combining topical application with oral therapy
produced better results than oral therapy alone. This suggests the
potential of topical application to complement the standard therapies
that can reduce recovery time and hospital visits while potentially
minimizing the need for hospitalization in severe cases of the disease.
        Lipid nanoparticles, on the other hand, have found their way into
the market to deliver vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. Several
clinical trials are underway for the delivery of mRNA-based vaccines
for various cancers and solid tumors using lipid nanoparticles. There are a few reported clinical trials for
the topical application of lipid nanoparticles-based formulations
to treat various skin conditions, including acne vulgaris and pityriasis
versicolor.
,
 The results of these trials
demonstrated the superior efficacy of SLNs-based formulation compared
to the commercial product in treating pityriasis versicolor, whereas
in the case of acne vulgaris, the formulation based on NLCs provided
skincare benefits as well. Similarly, the topical potential of nanoemulsions
(NE) was also confirmed by a few clinical studies. For example, in
one study, NE containing adapalene proved to be superior in terms
of efficacy compared to marketed adapalene gel to treat acne vulgaris. However, clinical trials that evaluate the
topical potential of lipid nanocarriers, other than liposomes, in
treating the lesions of CL are missing and highlight a research gap
that needs addressing.
      
    
    
      Challenges and Future Perspectives
      Lipid-based nanocarriers
(LNCs) also face numerous challenges in
the treatment of CL. One of the key obstacles in topical drug delivery
systems is the stratum corneum. It acts as a protective barrier and
limits drug penetration. Although lipid-based nanocarriers are designed
to enhance transdermal absorption, skin properties, lipid composition,
and hydrophilicity variations can lead to inconsistent drug delivery.
Moreover, there also remains uncertainty regarding nanoparticle penetration
and their ability to reach infected macrophages. Apart from that, LNCs face stability issues such as degradation,
drug leakage, and phase separation during storage. Physicochemical
properties might be altered due to temperature fluctuations and exposure
to external environmental factors, thus reducing their therapeutic
efficacy over time. Another major challenge
is to maintain an optimal balance between the drug encapsulation efficiency
and controlled drug release. Repeated application of nanocarriers
with surfactants or penetration enhancers may lead to local irritation
or hypersensitivity reactions, raising concerns about their prolonged
use in CL therapy. Large-scale manufacturing
of lipid-based nanocarriers is cost-intensive because it requires
precise control over particle size, charge, and encapsulation efficiency.
The transition from laboratory-scale research to commercial-scale
production remains a bottleneck due to variability, a lack of standardization,
and complex formulation methods. Regulatory guidelines for nanomedicine
approval are still in evolving stages, and the lack of specific criteria
for lipid-based nanoformulations poses additional challenges.

      Future research should focus on the aforementioned
key areas to
overcome these challenges and advance the clinical application of
lipid-based nanocarriers for the treatment of CL. For this purpose,
nanocarrier modifications can be explored to optimize drug penetration
across the skin barrier. Ligand-functionalized nanocarriers, microneedle-assisted
drug delivery systems, and hybrid nanoparticle systems combining lipid-based
carriers with polymeric nanostructures may enhance penetration and
drug retention time. Development of
lyophilized nanoformulations with cryoprotectants can significantly
increase storage stability and prolong shelf life. Microfluidic-based
nanocarrier synthesis is another promising approach for large-scale
and reproducible production by ensuring precise control over particle
size, charge, and encapsulation efficiency. Another focus should be on conducting long-term in vivo safety studies to assess the immune response, potential skin irritation,
hypersensitivity reactions, and systemic toxicity to repeated applications
of lipid-based nanocarriers. Furthermore, lipid formulations with
natural phospholipids, sterols, and antioxidant-loaded carriers can
be explored to minimize toxicity. Future studies should also conduct
randomized clinical trials to establish the efficacy, safety, and
patient acceptability of lipid-based nanocarriers for CL. Finally,
there is also a dire need to establish standardized characterization
protocols for LNCs in dermatological applications. Regulatory agencies
(e.g., FDA, EMA, WHO) can play a crucial role in defining acceptable
toxicity limits, stability criteria, and manufacturing guidelines.
      
        Toxicity Considerations of Lipid-based Nanocarriers
        Although the use of lipidic nanocarriers has gained widespread attention
from researchers in drug delivery, there is still a limited set of
data that specifically explores the toxic effects of these nanocarriers
on healthy and/or diseased tissues and cells. The possible immunological
reactions that these nanoparticles can elicit are another lesser-known
area and need further research so that these systems can be improved
and enter the market. In the case of lipidic nanocarriers, toxicities
and immune responses can arise from the lipid components as well as
various other excipients (surfactants, cholesterol, etc.) and compounds
used for surface modifications (PEG, conjugated antibodies).

        Cationic liposomes enhance the stability
and delivery of negatively charged nucleic acids and therefore are
being used extensively for said purpose. Many researchers have reported
the toxic effects of cationic liposomes on various cells, especially
macrophages and monocytes. Cationic liposomes were labeled as highly
toxic to macrophages with cytotoxic potential increased at higher
zeta potential values.
,
 Interestingly, in
the case of topical delivery in treating CL, this higher cytotoxicity
toward macrophages can be useful in combating the infected macrophages.
The presence of cholesterol in liposomes, although it has added benefits
as previously discussed, can impart independent toxicity problems
as well as release of inflammatory mediators (TNFα- & IL-6). There are also reports of hypersensitivity
reactions after the administration of liposomes that are attributed
to complement activation due to the surface PEG of stealth liposomes.

        On the other hand, SLNs and NLCs are
composed of lipids that are
generally recognized as safe (GRAS) excipients and are considered
safe. However, newer research on these
lipid nanoparticles involves surface modification to actively target
the drugs, which requires the use of various linking agents. These linkers and cryoprotectants can elicit
immune responses and toxicity problems.
,
 To demonstrate the biocompatibility of lipid nanoparticles in vitro,
researchers used cell viability assays on various cell lines. These
cell lines can tolerate SLNS or NLCs in doses up to 1–2 mg/mL.
,
 Selection of a suitable surfactant is also crucial to developing
a biocompatible lipid nanoparticle formulation in which nonionic surfactants
are always preferable. However, if the application requires the use
of a cationic surfactant, it always comes with a risk of decreased
compatibility. Cationic surfactants can cause immune system sensitization
as well as create pores and defects in the cell membranes.
,
 There are also numerous reports of evaluating skin irritation potential
using animal models that demonstrate these lipid nanoparticles as
extremely safe topical systems with either no signs of irritation
to the skin (edema or erythema)
,
 or significantly
less irritation compared to the marketed formulation of active ingredient.
,


        Nanoemulsions are mainly composed of ingredients that are
considered
safe and well tolerated. However, the main component that can cause
toxicity is the surfactant (cationic, anionic, or nonionic). In addition,
nanoemulsions can be formulated to contain various other ingredients
like gelling agents, ripening inhibitors, cosurfactants, or organic
solvents that can indirectly impart toxicity by altering cell membrane
permeability. There was no significant
difference in the toxicity of nanoemulsions when compared to emulsions
using Caco-2 cell lines, which shows that a reduction in particle
size did not affect toxicity.

        In the case of topical therapy, the main purpose of the formulation
is to reach into the skin layers while avoiding systemic uptake. Therefore,
the systemic toxicity that may arise after the topical application
of nanoformulations must be taken into account. Although lipidic nanocarriers
mainly comprise well-tolerated and safe lipids, the effect of other
excipients should always be evaluated when nanotoxicology. Undesired
immunological effects and hypersensitivity reactions are some other
aspects that can result in reduced safety of lipid nanocarriers, and
more research work is needed in this area to produce fully capable
topical drug delivery systems.
,


        Each class of
lipid-based nanocarriers has its specific advantages
and concerns regarding topical application. Liposomes and ultradeformable
liposomes can squeeze through the stratum corneum barrier and provide
enhanced skin flux, while at the same time, they possess stability
issues that require postprocessing steps, such as freeze-drying, to
enhance the stability of the final formulation. Lipid nanoparticles
have improved stability, and there is the possibility of topical gel
formulations that can be stable over a storage period, but there is
the issue of drugs leaking out of the nanocarriers over time. This
problem was overcome by the introduction of nanostructured lipid carriers.
Nanoemulsions have also been traditionally linked to drug leaking,
highlighting the area for further research to improve their stability.
      
    
    
      Conclusions
      Topical delivery is an attractive alternative
treatment route for
cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), offering significant advantages over
systemic therapy. This review demonstrated the potential of lipid-based
colloidal carriers in enhancing topical drug delivery, particularly
for CL. These nanocarriers provide key benefits such as improved skin
penetration, occlusive effects, enhanced skin targeting and deposition,
as well as sustained drug release at the target site, addressing some
of the challenges of conventional dosage forms. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have consistently demonstrated
promising results in improving topical drug efficacy to treat the
lesions of CL.
      Despite these advantages, challenges remain,
including formulation
optimization, large-scale production, and clinical validation. Even
with encouraging preclinical findings in the field, there is a limited
set of data on clinical trials, and that too is confined to liposomes.
Future research should focus on refining the formulation parameters,
improving the stability, and conducting large-scale extensive clinical
trials to facilitate regulatory approval and real-world application.
The use of advanced production techniques, such as microfluidics,
can further improve the reproducibility and scalability of lipid-based
nanocarriers. Given that liposomes and lipid nanoparticles are already
in commercial use for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications, their

Title: Prebiotic Oligosaccharides in Skin Health: Benefits, Mechanisms, and Cosmetic Applications

Abstract: Prebiotic oligosaccharides have attracted significant interest in dermatology and skin health due to their ability to modulate the skin microbiome and microbiota–host interactions. This review offers a novel dual perspective, systematically examining the benefits of both oral intake and topical application of prebiotic oligosaccharides, including well-established prebiotics (e.g., human milk oligosaccharides, galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides) and emerging prebiotic candidates (e.g., gluco-oligosaccharides, chitosan-oligosaccharides, agaro-oligosaccharides). First, cutting-edge synthetic processes for producing diverse oligosaccharides and their structural chemistry are introduced. Then, we discuss in vitro studies demonstrating their efficacy in promoting skin commensals, inhibiting pathogens, and conferring protective effects, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-melanogenic, and wound-healing properties. Furthermore, we emphasize in vivo animal studies and clinical trials revealing that prebiotic oligosaccharides, administered orally or topically, alleviate atopic dermatitis, enhance skin hydration, attenuate acne, and protect against photo-aging by modulating skin–gut microbiota and immune responses. Mechanistically, we integrate genetic and molecular insights to elucidate how oligosaccharides mediate these benefits, including gut–skin axis crosstalk, immune regulation, and microbial metabolite signaling. Finally, we highlight current commercial applications of oligosaccharides in cosmetic formulations while addressing scientific and practical challenges, such as structure–function relationships, clinical scalability, and regulatory considerations. This review bridges mechanistic understanding with practical applications, offering a comprehensive resource for advancing prebiotic oligosaccharides-based skincare therapies.

Body: 1. Introduction
      The skin microbiota, the human body’s second-largest microbial community after the gut, plays a crucial role in skin disease and well-being [1,2]. Skin microbiota can be commensal, mutualistic (beneficial), or pathogenic. A balanced composition of commensal (e.g., Staphylococcus epidermidis, Cutibacterium acnes) and pathogenic (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) microorganisms maintains skin homeostasis [3], while dysbiosis contributes to disorders like atopic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, etc. [4,5,6,7]. In addition, the skin microbiota also actively supports skin barrier function, including skin hydration, anti-aging, anti-melanogenesis, etc. [1,8].
      Prebiotics have recently gained significant attention in dermatology and skin health due to their ability to modulate host microbiota beyond the gastrointestinal tract [9,10]. Defined as substrates selectively utilized by host microorganisms to confer health benefits, prebiotics now encompass compounds targeting diverse microbial communities, including those residing on the skin [11,12,13]. While dietary fibers, like fructans, carrageenan, and fucoidans, have been extensively reviewed for skin health benefits [14,15,16], prebiotic oligosaccharides, which usually consist of 2–20 monosaccharide units, represent particularly promising skin therapies. Well-established prebiotic oligosaccharides include human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOSs), and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOSs), which show efficacy in mitigating atopic dermatitis [17,18,19]. Emerging oligosaccharides, such as gluco-oligosaccharides (GlcOSs), xylo-oligosaccharides (XOSs), chitosan oligosaccharides (COSs), agaro-oligosaccharides (AOSs), etc., exhibit diverse biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging effects, as evidenced by in vitro and in vivo studies [20,21,22].
      Current research on prebiotic oligosaccharides has primarily investigated their oral administration and systemic effects on skin health. But accumulating evidence now demonstrates the efficacy of topical application in delivering targeted dermatological benefits [18,23]. Clinical studies have documented that GOSs incorporated in cosmetic formulations significantly enhance skin hydration, particularly improving water-holding capacity and reducing transepidermal water loss in healthy female subjects [24,25]. Furthermore, emerging clinical evidence supports the anti-aging and photoprotective properties of various functional oligosaccharides when applied topically, including GlcOSs [26], XOSs [21], and COSs [27]. These findings highlight the dual mechanisms of oligosaccharides through oral intake or topical application, underscoring their considerable potential as active ingredients in advanced cosmetic formulations, which aligns with the growing consumer demand for science-backed, bioactive ingredients for next-generation skincare products.
      Despite substantial evidence supporting the skin health benefits of functional oligosaccharides, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding their mechanisms of action. For example, oral administration of HMOs has been shown to alleviate pediatric atopic dermatitis (AD) through gut microbiota modulation and immune system interactions [17], but the underlying biological pathways require further elucidation. Similarly, in vitro and in vivo studies observed benefits of GOSs, FOSs, and GlcOSs in acne management, skin hydration, anti-aging, etc. [28,29,30]. However, methodological inconsistencies across studies and insufficient investigation of the structure–biological function relationships of oligosaccharides significantly limit the basic understanding of their mechanisms of action. Particularly, the underlying mechanisms of topically applied prebiotic oligosaccharides remain poorly understood because of the scarcity of dedicated studies.
      Therefore, this review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in the applications of well-established and tentative prebiotic oligosaccharides—both orally and topically—in modulating skin microbiota and their subsequent effects on skin health and cosmetic benefits (illustrated in Figure 1). These benefits include, but are not limited to, the alleviation of atopic dermatitis, acne prevention, enhanced skin hydration, anti-melanogenesis, anti-aging properties, and photoprotection. First, well-established and tentative prebiotic oligosaccharides are introduced, covering their chemical structures and novel production methods. Next, we systematically review in vitro and in vivo studies elucidating the functional roles of oligosaccharides in skin health, followed by an in-depth discussion of their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, this review examines the practical utilization of prebiotic oligosaccharides in commercial cosmetic formulations, emphasizing key bioactive ingredients and their integration into skincare products. Finally, we address current challenges and propose future research directions to advance this promising field.
    
    
      2. Prebiotic Oligosaccharides: Chemical Structures and Novel Production Methods
      The International Association of Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) defines prebiotics as substrates selectively utilized by host microorganisms to confer health benefits, including those targeting extraintestinal niches like the skin [12]. While formally recognized prebiotics include non-digestible oligosaccharides, such as human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), fructo-oligosaccharides (FOSs), and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOSs), emerging candidates, like gluco-oligosaccharides (GlcOSs), xylo-oligosaccharides (XOSs), and chitosan oligosaccharides (COSs), are gaining plenty of attention. This section summarizes the skin-beneficial oligosaccharides, detailing their structural characteristics (monomeric composition, degree of polymerization, glycosidic linkages) and production methods (Table 1), as these parameters critically determine their skin health efficacy.
      
        2.1. Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs)
        The first recognized group of prebiotics includes HMOs, with approximately 200 different structures characterized in human breast milk [12,32]. Structurally, HMOs consist of fucose (Fuc) and/or N-Acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) attached to galactose, N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), or glucose residues, classifying them into fucosylated, sialylated, and neutral core HMOs [51]. For research purposes, HMOs can be isolated directly from breast milk or synthesized through enzymatic, chemical, or chemoenzymatic methods. Enzymatic methods catalyzed by glycosidases, glycotransferases, or glycosynthases enable the production of diverse HMOs with varying DPs, monomer compositions, and glycosidic linkages [32]. Commercial-scale production of HMOs relies on microbial fermentation techniques, where metabolically engineered microorganisms (primarily E. coli) convert inexpensive carbon sources, such as lactose and glucose, into HMOs [31,32,33]. As illustrated in Figure 2, the strains are modified to express glycosyltransferases and synthesize sugar nucleotides (e.g., CMP-Neu5Ac, GDP-Fuc, UDP-GlcNAc) in vivo. The glycosyltransferases then transfer sugar moieties (e.g., sialy group, fucosyl groups) to lactose, yielding HMOs, such as 3′-sialylactose/6′-sialylactose and 2′-fucosyllactose (2′-FL) [13]. Notably, 2′-FL, the most prevalent HMO, has been produced commercially and widely incorporated into infant formula [52].
      
      
        2.2. Galacto-Oligosaccharides (GOSs)
        GOSs consist of galactosyl oligomers typically terminating with lactose. Commercial GOS products, such as Vivinal® GOSs, Bimuno® GOSs, and Oligomate 55® GOSs, are produced via β-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23, from, e.g., Bacillus circulans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Aspergillus oryzae)-catalyzed transgalactosylation of lactose [34,36]. As illustrated in Figure 3, GOS synthesis involves lactose hydrolysis, galactosyl–enzyme intermediate formation, and intra- and intermolecular transgalactosylation. The product yield and structures depend on the kinetic difference between hydrolysis and transgalactosylation, which are governed by reaction conditions (e.g., initial lactose concentration, temperature, water activity) and enzyme properties (hydrolytic activity and transferase activity) [53]. The resulting GOS mixtures exhibit diverse DP (usually 2 to 10) and glycosidic bonds (β-(1→6), β-(1→4), β-(1→3), β-(1→2), and also (1↔1)-linked non-reducing disaccharides (β-D-Galp-(1↔1)-α-D-Glcp and β-D-Galp-(1↔1)-β-D-Glcp)) [54]. Alternative dairy sources, like milk and whey permeates, have been utilized to enhance the GOS production economy [53,55]. A recent advance involves the chemical synthesis of GOSs via lactose hydrolysis and dehydrative glycosylation in concentrated sulfuric acid, generating potential prebiotic GOSs with novel α and β linkages [35].
      
      
        2.3. Fructo-Oligosaccharides (FOSs)
        FOSs consist of β-(2→1)-linked fructosyl chains terminating with sucrose. Commercial FOS production is well-established by major manufacturers (Actilight, Beneo, Meiji, NutraFlora) [37]. Two industrial processes yield structurally distinct FOSs (Figure 4). S-FOSs are produced via sucrose transfructosylation using fructosyltransferases (FTases), yielding exclusively GFn type FOSs (1-kestose (GF2), nystose (GF3), and fructosylnystose (GF4)) [56]. Recent research focuses on the heterologous expression of FTases from yeast and bacterial expression systems [57]. On the other hand, H-FOSs are generated through controlled inulin hydrolysis by endoinulinase, producing mixed GFn type and Fn type FOSs (such as inulobiose (F2), inulotriose (F3), and inulotetraose (F4)) [37,58]. H-FOSs exhibited broader DP distribution (from two to nine) and larger average DP (4.0) compared to S-FOSs (from two to four, average DP 3.6) [59]. In the lab, while acid hydrolysis (HCl/H2SO4) offers a simpler alternative for inulin hydrolysis: it generates undesired byproducts (fructose, 5-HMF) with low FOS selectivity [37].
      
      
        2.4. Gluco-Oligosaccharides (GlcOSs)
        GlcOSs comprise glucose oligomers with α/β-(1→6/4/3/2/1) glycosidic linkages. The predominant commercial GlcOSs are isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMOs), which are DP 2–6 GlcOSs with mainly α-(1→6) and α-(1→4) glycosidic bonds, marketed as ISOThrive nectar, Vitafiber, FiberYu, IMO-900, Wako IMOs, etc. [60]. As detailed in our recent review [40], industrial IMO production employs either (1) starch (corn, tapioca) processing via sequential liquefaction, hydrolysis, and transglycosylation using hydrolases and α-transglucosidase or (2) direct sucrose/maltose conversion via dextransucrase (EC 2.4.1.5)-catalyzed transglycosylation. A less common commercial GlcOS, gentio-oligosaccharides (GnOSs), consists of β-(1→6)-linked GlcOSs synthesized through β-glucosidase-mediated glucose reversion [61].
        Recent advances in chemical synthesis have expanded the routes for producing prebiotic GlcOSs from glucose, maltose, and cellulose feedstocks. Dehydrative glycosylation of glucose in concentrated LiBr (61.7%), H2SO4 (≥72%), or H3PO4 (≥85%) yields short-chain GlcOSs (DP mostly 2–10) with diverse α/β-(1→6/4/3/2/1) linkages [62,63]. Recent advances in linkage-controllable GlcOS synthesis include zeolite-confined glucose glycosylation [64] and direct maltose glycosylation in unacidified LiBr [42]. Moreover, the production of β-(1→4)-linked cello-oligosaccharides (one type of GlcOS) from abundant cellulose resources is highly promising [65]. The key challenges involve the disruption of cellulose’s crystalline structure within weakly acidic solvents (nonacidified 61.7% LiBr (a.q.), essential for achieving selective cleavage of glycosidic bonds) [66,67] and controlled depolymerization to oligosaccharides (DP 4–11, 90.3% yield) while minimizing glucose formation [68]. To advance commercial viability, current research focuses on (1) developing efficient separation protocols for oligosaccharide recovery [69,70], (2) optimizing solvent systems for obtaining higher GlcOS concentration [71], and (3) employing combined hydrolysis and glycosylation to improve GlcOS solubility in water [72]. These methods have been explored on various lignocellulosic biomasses (e.g., birch, poplar, and corn stover) for GlcOS production, demonstrating potential for sustainable industrial production [45,73,74].
      
      
        2.5. Other Prebiotic Oligosaccharides
        Xylo-oligosaccharides (XOSs) are β-(1→4) linked xylose oligomers (DP typically 2–6), commercially produced from corncob xylan through alkaline extraction and controlled enzymatic hydrolysis by endo-1,4-xylanase. Recent efforts focus on utilizing abundant lignocellulosic biomass (e.g., wheat bran, cotton stalk, corn stover, sugarcane bagasse) as alternative feedstocks for XOS production [75,76]. The resulting XOSs maintain the β-(1→4) xylose backbone but may contain arabinose or ferulic acid substitutions, depending on the source material [77].
        Chitosan oligosaccharides (COSs) are β-(1→4) linked glucosamine oligomers that are produced via chitin deacetylation and depolymerization processes. Acid hydrolysis (e.g., HCl, H3PO4), oxidative degradation, ultrasonic treatment, ultraviolet irradiation, and enzymatic hydrolysis (chitosanases, cellulases) are feasible for chitin depolymerization [47,48]. Deacetylation can be achieved using fungal-derived chitin deacetylase or chemically through a reaction in a concentrated alkaline solution (e.g., 50% NaOH) [78,79].
        Agaro-oligosaccharides (AOSs) derive from agar (extracted from red algae) degradation via acid hydrolysis (HCl, H3PO4, citric acid, solid acids, trifluoroacetic acid), enzymatic hydrolysis (α/β-agarases), or microbial fermentation (e.g., Bacteroides uniformis NP1) [20]. AOSs contain two structural types: neoagaro-oligosaccharides (NAOSs) with α-1,3-linked-3,6-anhydro-L-galactose (L-AHG) termini and agaro-oligosaccharides (AOSs) with β-1,4-linked-D-galactose (D-Gal) termini.
      
    
    
      3. In Vitro Studies of Prebiotic Oligosaccharides on the Skin Microbiome and Related Skin Health Effects
      Table 2 highlights recent in vitro studies of prebiotic oligosaccharides (e.g., HMOs, GOSs, FOSs) and candidate oligosaccharides (e.g., GlcOSs, XOSs, COSs) on the promotion of skin health. The key findings include the positive effects of oligosaccharides on the promotion of skin commensal and pathogen inhibition, anti-melanogenic effects, antioxidant and anti-inflammation, and wound healing. In the following subsection, the specific type, chemistry, and dosage of oligosaccharides are introduced, and the action of mechanisms by which they confer skin health effects are discussed as well.
      
        3.1. Promotion of Skin Commensals and Inhibition of Pathogens (HMOs, GOSs, FOSs, GlcOSs)
        Mortaz et al. reported that galacto-oligosaccharides (GOSs) and 2′-fucosyllactose (2′-FL) directly suppressed the growth of specific pathogenic microbes, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), and affected the phagocytosis of neutrophils [80]. Their results showed that GOSs (5%, 10%) and 2.5% 2′-FL significantly decreased SA and PA bacterial growth/CFUs (p ≤ 0.05), and SA and PA growth lag times were suppressed by co-incubation with GOSs (>2.5%) or 2′-FL (1.5%). In vitro assays using human blood polymorphonuclear cells indicated that GOSs/2′-FL were able to increase the ability of bacteria phagocytosis by neutrophils, providing potential wound healing.
        Early in vitro studies indicated substantial metabolism of gluco-oligosaccharides (GlcOSs) by skin commensals, such as Rothia kristinae, Kytococcus sedentarius, Staphylococcus capitis, Corynebacterium xerosis, and Lactiplantibacillus pentosus [97]. In contrast, pathogenic or opportunistic strains, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Cutibacterium acnes, did not or minimally metabolized the GlcOSs. Meanwhile, the acidic medium (potentially lactic acid) after bacterial fermentation also showed an inhibitory effect on skin pathogens. Another study reported that GlcOSs alone inhibited glycocalyx production by S. aureus cells, indicating their ability to suppress the skin pathogen [83].
        Liu-Walsh et al. reported that a colloidal-oat-containing prebiotic β-glucan (5%) significantly promoted the growth rate and metabolism of the skin commensal S. epidermidis ATCC 12228, while it only increased the growth rate of S. aureus ATCC 6538 in an in vitro competition assay [84]. Furthermore, β-glucan metabolism significantly increased the concentration of lactic acid, a natural moisturizing factor of the stratum corneum skin barrier, which contributed to skin hydration with a slightly acidic pH.
        Li et al. investigated the impacts of four prebiotic oligosaccharides (FOSs, GOSs, IMOs, and inulin) on the in vitro growth of a skin commensal S. epidermidis CCSM0287 (a potential skin probiotic) [23]. Their results showed that all four oligosaccharides (2% (w/v) in final media) supported the growth of S. epidermidis CCSM0424, with FOSs being the most effective. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) analysis indicated that the fermentation of oligosaccharides by S. epidermidis CCSM0287 produced acetic acid and isovaleric acid, which was different from the metabolites from gut bacteria. In addition, the post-fermentation supernatant (postbiotics) from 2% FOSs significantly inhibited S. aureus CCSM0424 biofilm formation. Their study proved that FOSs are a potential skin prebiotic that significantly promotes the growth of S. epidermidis and inhibits S. aureus biofilm formation, thus exerting the probiotic effects of S. epidermidis.
        Fourniere et al. studied the production of oligosaccharides from Ulva sp. (green alga) and their effects on the skin bacteria S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and C. acnes [87]. The oligosaccharides produced from the enzymatic extraction and depolymerization of Ulva sp. (Ulvan) consisted of 24.4–30.4% carbohydrates (44.9–55.4% rhamnose and 7.5–11.0% glucuronic acid) and 21.6–30.8% uronic acid, with a molecular weight of 8 kDa and 1.5 kDa, respectively. The Ulvan-derived oligosaccharides at a concentration of 1000 μg/mL did not affect the bacterial growth of S. aureus MFP03 and S. epidermidis MFP04 in terms of generation time, but they were able to modify their biofilm structures in vitro. In addition, the Ulvan-derived oligosaccharides did not significantly change the cytotoxic potential of S. epidermidis and S. aureus towards HaCaT keratinocytes. Also, the inflammatory potential of both acneic and non-acneic C. acnes strains on HaCaT keratinocytes was decreased up to 39.8% by the treatment with the oligosaccharides. The results suggested the potential of Ulvan-derived oligosaccharides for dermo-cosmetic applications.
        From the above studies, several mechanisms are suggested to explain the effects of oligosaccharides on the promotion of skin commensals and/or inhibition of pathogens. First, prebiotic oligosaccharides act as a direct carbon source for the growth of skin commensals, rather than pathogens, and produce fermentation metabolites, such as lactic acid and SCFAs, to modulate skin pH for a favorable microenvironment [23,84]. Alternatively, skin microbes that metabolize prebiotic oligosaccharides can also provide substrates for the growth of non-metabolizing microbes, thus reinforcing commensal networks through cross-feeding and preventing pathogen overgrowth [3,98]. In terms of pathogen colonization resistance, two pathways have been proposed for the metabolism of prebiotic oligosaccharides (Figure 5): (1) skin commensals secrete antimicrobial metabolites, such as bacteriocins, and phenol soluble modulins, to directly suppress pathogens or alter the virulence of pathogens and (2) skin commensals signal to the host to mount a protective immune response to invading pathogens [3].
      
      
        3.2. Anti-Melanogenesis (HMOs, GOSs, AOSs)
        Kwak et al. reported that 2′-fucosyllactose (2′-FL), a major component in HMOs, was considered as a potential skin whitening cosmetic material with anti-melanogenic effects [88,89]. In vitro assays on MNT-1 cells and human-derived melanocytes showed a 40% reduction in melanin production with 2′-FL treatment (no cytotoxicity at 20 g/L) [88]. The anti-melanogenic effects of 2′-FL are mediated through the AMPK-ULK1 autophagy pathway (Figure 6). 2′-FL activates AMPK, which phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser555, initiating autophagy while inhibiting mTORC1. This triggers the formation of autophagosomes, marked by light chain 3 (LC3)-II conversion, which engulf melanosomes for lysosomal degradation. Concurrently, 2′-FL downregulates melanogenic enzymes (tyrosinase and TYRP1) and, thus, suppresses melanin production [89]. Studies confirm that this pathway—validated by AMPK inhibition experiments—leads to ~40% melanin reduction in melanocytes without cytotoxicity, positioning HMOs as promising natural agents for treating hyperpigmentation in cosmetics [88,89].
        Suh et al. reported the inhibitory effects of GOSs on skin pigmentation through in vitro and clinical trials [29]. In vitro cell viability tests suggested that there was no cytotoxicity on B16F10 cells with GOS concentrations of 70 mg/mL or less (GOS purity of 74.9%). Melanin production in B16F10 cells was significantly inhibited by 14 mg/mL GOS (p < 0.05), and treatment with 70 mg/mL GOS decreased about 25% of the melanin production. In addition, 14–35 mg/mL GOS showed a positive effect on UVB-irradiated HaCaT keratinocytes, but higher concentrations (70 mg/mL) inhibited cell viability, possibly because of osmotic pressure (rather than GOS toxicity). Clinical trials suggested that after a 12-week GOS treatment (1 g, twice per day) on healthy women (40–60 yrs, N = 84), the melanin index and erythema index both significantly decreased (p < 0.05), suggesting the potential role of GOSs as a nutritional approach for the inhibition of skin pigmentation.
        Kim et al. investigated the enzymatic production of 3,6-anyhydro-L-galactose (AHG) from agarose (red algae) and its skin whitening properties [90]. An in vitro skin whitening assay indicated that 100 μg/mL AHG was able to significantly suppress melanin production in murine B16F10 melanoma cells, and AHG up to 200 μg/mL did not show significant cytotoxicity. In addition, AHG showed strong anti-inflammatory activity in suppressing in vitro nitrite production. Later, the same group systematically investigated the skin whitening activity of AHG and AHG-containing oligosaccharides (agaro-oligosaccharides (AOSs), neoagaro-oligosaccharides (NAOSs)) via in vitro cell assays [91]. It was found that AHG, AOSs, and NAOSs at 12.5/25/50 μg/mL did not exhibit cytotoxicity toward murine B16 melanoma cells or human epidermal melanocytes (HEMs). Moreover, AHG significantly reduced the intracellular melanin content in B16 cells and HEMs and NAOSs (DP 4 and DP 6) exerted a moderate anti-melanogenic effect, while NAOSs (DP 2) and AOSs (DP 3, DP 5, and DP 7) did not reduce melanin production. The authors claimed that AHG is responsible for the anti-melanogenic activity in AOSs. The structural differences explained their difference in skin whitening properties, i.e., the non-reducing end of NAOSs contains AHG, while that of AOSs contains galactose.
        Recently, Aisa et al. reported that a novel oligosaccharide compound (referred to as ACO-II-1), extracted from almond, with a structure of β-D-Fruf-(1→2)-β-D-Fru-(1→6)-α-D-Glcp-(1→1)-α-D-Glcp, showed strong antioxidant activity and an inhibition effect on melanogenesis in forskolin (FSK)-induced B16F10 melanoma cells [99]. ACO-II-1 was able to reduce intracellular melanin content and tyrosinase activity, with a reduced expression of tyrosinase, TRP-1, TRP-2, and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). An investigation into the mechanism showed that the anti-melanogenic properties of ACO-II-1 were mediated through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and β-catenin signaling pathways.
      
      
        3.3. Antioxidant and Anti-Inflammation Activities (AOSs, GlcOSs, FOSs, GOSs, XOSs)
        In a recent study by Lee et al., a mixture (referred to as AO13) of 3,6-anyhydro-L-galactose (AHG) and agaro-oligosaccharides (AOSs, DP 3) exerted strong antioxidant activity in human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) in vitro [92]. Specifically, AO13 exhibited no cytotoxicity in HDFs and promoted cell proliferation. In addition, AO13 showed higher reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging activity than the neoagaro-oligosaccharides (NAOSs, DP 2 and DP 4) in H2O2-induced HDFs in vitro, mainly because of the structural difference, i.e., AOSs contain galactose at the non-reducing end, whereas NAOSs contain AHG. Since ROS promote skin aging by driving extracellular matrix degradation in the dermis, the authors suggested that odd-numbered AOSs might help prevent skin aging by protecting against oxidative stress, thus exerting antioxidant activity.
        Park et al. reported the synthesis, prebiotic effect, and anti-inflammatory properties of α-gluco-oligosaccharides (α-GlcOSs) produced by Leuconostoc lactis SBC001 [93]. Glucansucrases produced by Leuconostoc lactis SBC001 catalyzed the transglycosylation reaction of maltose and sucrose, which produced α-GlcOSs consisting of 24% α-(1→4) and 76% α-(1→6) linkages with an average molecular weight of 1137 Da (average DP around 7). The resultant α-GlcOSs showed anti-inflammatory activity towards lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 265.7 macrophage cells in vitro. Specifically, α-GlcOS treatment decreased the production of nitric oxide by suppressing the expression of nitric oxide synthase. In addition, the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10) were suppressed. Also, the nuclear factor-kappa B signaling pathway was inhibited by α-GlcOS treatment. Furthermore, it was predicted that the anti-inflammatory properties of α-GlcOSs were attributed to the reduced inflammatory response by suppressing the inflammatory-associated genes and cytokines in the NF-κB signaling pathway and the MAPK signaling pathway. On the other hand, α-GlcOSs promoted the in vitro growth of six bacterial (potential probiotic) and yeast strains, exerting their prebiotic potential.
        Chang et al. prepared pectic oligosaccharides (POSs) of different molecular weights via hydrolysis of okra pectin (112.31 kDa) by the Fenton reaction using varied concentrations of FeSO4. They found that the smallest POSs (1.79 kDa) showed the highest prebiotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities [94]. Specifically, the POSs promoted the in vitro growth of two probiotic strains (Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus ATCC 7469 and Bifidobacterium longum ATCC 15707) with increased SCFA levels. Compared to the original pectin, the POSs with lower molecular weights showed stronger antioxidant activities by scavenging DPPH and ABTS radicals. Moreover, the POSs inhibited LPS-induced nitrite and inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL) IL-1β and IL-6) and also inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/NF-κB signaling pathways in RAW 264.7 cells.
        GOSs, FOSs, XOSs, chitio-oligosaccharides, and other polysaccharides, such as fructans, arabinoxylans, and β-glucans, were reported to have strong antioxidant activity and to act as reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers by scavenging free radicals, such as the superoxide anion (O2•−), hydroxyl radical (•OH), and nonradical molecules, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen (1O2) [100]. The mechanism (Figure 7) was suggested to be that oligosaccharide metabolism and production of SCFAs are able to induce the expression of crucial antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and reduce the generation of oxidative products during digestion and colonic fermentation [101,102]. GSTs are a family of enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to various substrates, thereby neutralizing ROS) and other oxidative products. By enhancing the expression of GSTs, oligosaccharides effectively reduce the oxidative burden within the body, protecting cells and tissues from oxidative damage. Furthermore, in vivo studies have highlighted a potential synergistic effect between prebiotic oligosaccharides and polyphenols [103]. When oligosaccharides, such as FOSs and GOSs, are metabolized in the large intestine, the resulting SCFAs may enhance the bioavailability and efficacy of polyphenols. This synergistic interaction provides an early defense against oxidative stress, as the combined action of SCFAs and polyphenols can more effectively neutralize ROS and other free radicals compared to either component alone.
      
      
        3.4. Wound Healing (GOSs, Thiolated Oligosaccharides)
        Silvagno et al. conducted in vitro assays using human keratinocyte cell lines and reported the beneficial effect of GOSs (prepared from whey permeate) on wound healing and skin health due to their direct activity on keratinocyte functions [30]. GOS treatment (3%, 7 days) stimulated a beneficial reversible inflammatory response (IL-8 upregulated by nuclear factor kappa B signaling) in HaCaT cells and promoted cell migration and E-cadherin loss without epithelial–mesenchymal transition. In addition, GOS treatment led to enhanced mitochondrial function associated with the translocation of the Forkhead Box O1 transcription factor. GOSs also triggered an increased expression of cell differentiation markers that contribute to wound healing processes. These results suggested the potential topical application of GOSs for wound healing purposes.
        Santos et al. found that dietary supplementation of inulin and GOSs can improve colonic healing and surgical recovery in mice experiments with a surgical colonic anastomosis [95]. Mice were fed a diet containing inulin, GOSs, or a non-fermentable dietary fiber cellulose (all 10 wt/wt%) for two weeks before undergoing colonic anastomotic surgery. It was found that oligosaccharides improved the general health of operated mice, based on increased body weight, and induced the thickening of the colonic wall. In addition, inulin/GOS supplementation resulted in significantly higher levels of SCFAs, such as butyrate, lowering the incidence of anastomotic leaks. The improved anastomotic healing was mostly attributed to an enhanced re-epithelialization of the wound, indicated by increased epithelial proliferation (indicated by mucosal layer). In addition, inulin and GOS diets resulted in elevated collagen levels in peri-anastomotic tissue and an inhibitory effect on collagenases, such as matrix metalloproteinases, responsible for collagen degradation.
        Schnürch et al. found that thiolated poly- and oligosaccharide-based hydrogels are highly advantageous for tissue engineering and wound healing, such as thiolated chitosan and thiolated hyaluronic acid (Glycosil) [96]. Thiolated poly- and oligosaccharide-based hydrogels have good biocompatibility, biodegradability, and nontoxicity and perform well in the role of wound dressings with unique features, such as in situ gelling, cell adhesion (bioadhesion), drug release control, enzyme inhibition, and metal binding properties (mitigate toxic effects). These features are primarily attributed to their capability to form disulfide bonds with each other and/or endogenous proteins. Figure 8 illustrates the functional roles of thiolated poly- and oligosaccharide-based hydrogels in the four key stages of the wound healing process. The mechanism underlying the effectiveness of thiolated poly- and oligosaccharide-based hydrogels as wound dressings can be attributed to their capacity to absorb and retain wound exudates, thereby creating a conducive environment for critical biological events, such as fibroblast proliferation and keratinocyte migration.
      
    
    
      4. In Vivo Studies of Prebiotic Oligosaccharides on the Skin Microbiome and Related Skin Health Effects
      This section summarizes the in vivo animal and human trials that have investigated the effects of prebiotic oligosaccharides on the skin microbiome and related skin health benefits, as detailed in Table 3. By examining oral and topical administration methods, this section elucidates how prebiotic oligosaccharides modulate skin and gut microbiota to confer benefits, such as alleviation of atopic dermatitis, acne attenuation, enhanced skin hydration, and anti-aging effects. The discussion also addresses mechanistic insights, clinical outcomes, and the role of microbial metabolites (e.g., SCFAs) in mediating these effects, offering a holistic perspective on their therapeutic and cosmetic potential.
      
        4.1. Alleviation or Prevention of Atopic Dermatitis (HMOs, FOSs, GOSs, AOSs)
        HMOs play an important role in establishing the infant gut microbiota and have immunomodulatory effects on the infant gut system, which have been gradually examined with preventive effects against atopic dermatitis (AD)/eczema in infants [119,120]. Several studies and meta-analyses have reported a protective role of HMOs against AD when infants are fed human milk, particularly during the first 4 months of life [17,121]. The action mechanism of HMOs was summarized in a recent review by Ceraj et al. [17], which is illustrated in Figure 9. Specifically, HMOs act as food for infant gut microorganisms, such as B. infantis, Bacteroides spp., and others, producing metabolites like SCFAs upon metabolism. Then, SCFAs can modulate the immune response by interacting with dendritic cells that extend dendrites into the gut lumen or by crossing the epithelial barrier to directly interact with immune cells in the lamina propria. As a result, interleukins, such as IL-10, are released by dendritic cells and function in the regulation of inflammation. The authors found that infants with microorganisms that have the complete set of HMO metabolizing genes are protected from the development of AD/eczema and/or experience reduced severity of AD/eczema. In addition, Thanabalu et al. reported that SCFAs from the metabolism of prebiotic oligosaccharides affect peripheral inflammation by locally promoting iTreg development in the intestine that then migrate to target skin, where the Th2 cell response was suppressed, resulting in a protective effect against atopic dermatitis [105].
        Tang et al. reported that dietary GOSs ameliorated atopic dermatitis (AD)-like skin inflammation and behavioral deficits (anxiety, depression) by modulating the gut microbiota–brain–skin axis [18]. GOS treatment (purity >95%, 0.5 or 1.5 g/kg) markedly relieved skin inflammation by decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines IgE, IL-4, IL-13, IFN-γ, and TNF-α and regulating PPAR-γ/NF-κB signaling in 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB)-induced AD mice (N = 40). Furthermore, GOS treatment significantly improved anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms by normalizing the neurotransmitter levels of 5-HT, DA, NE, and CORT in the brain. The underlying mechanisms were that GOSs restructured the gut microbiota and specifically promoted Lactobacillus and Alloprevotella, which increase fecal SCFAs, particularly acetate and butyrate. A marked correlation between the altered intestinal microbiota/SCFAs, AD-associated symptoms, and comorbid behavioral phenotypes (anxiety, depression) was substantiated by Pearson correlation analysis.
        Kim et al. investigated the mechanism through which kestose-enriched FOSs alleviated AD and compared it to the effects of normal FOSs [106]. The oral administration (7.3 mg powder/day or 4.9 mg syrup/day) of kestose-enriched FOSs (>85% kestose) in ovalbumin-sensitized Balb/c mice was found to increase fecal propionic and butyric acid levels to a greater extent than that of normal FOSs (33% kestose). This was the result of FOS-modulated gut microbiota, with an increasing abundance of Lactobacillus and Alistipes and a decreased abundance of Prevotella. Moreover, kestose-enriched FOSs significantly reduced the serum levels of Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TARC, and eotaxin) and Treg cytokines (IL-10 and IL-1β) while increasing Th1 cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12). This indicated that the allergic inflammation of AD was suppressed by kestose-enriched FOSs through their immunological recovery of the Th1/Th2 balance.
        Ren et al. reported that the alginate oligosaccharides (AOSs) of different structures mediated the gut–skin axis balance and prevented skin aging in mouse models [107]. Oral gavage of all AOSs (10 mg/kg) significantly upregulated skin aging phenotypes (increased stratum corneum water content, skin elasticity, epidermal thickness, collagen thickness, increased DEJ tortuosity, and reduced fibrotic area) in aging mice. Among the three types of AOSs, MAOSs (mannuronate oligosaccharides, 6.44 kDa, mannuronate/guluronate ratio 12.56) markedly mediated the colonic butyrate-HIF-1α axis homeostasis, which promoted the entry of butyrate into the skin, upregulated the mitophagy level, and ultimately improved skin aging via the HDAC3/PHD/HIF-1α/mitophagy loop in mice.
      
      
        4.2. Prevention of Allergies (HMOs, GOSs, FOSs)
        Allergic diseases, such as respiratory allergies, food allergies, and atopic dermatitis, have shown increasing prevalence, particularly among children and infants, which has triggered interest in dietary intervention in early life to modulate gut and immune maturation. HMOs have been shown to exhibit effects in the modulation of the gut microbiome [33,52] and mucosal immune response, which play a potential role in the prevention of allergic diseases [17]. Zuurveld et al. summarized the possible functions of HMOs related to the protection of allergic diseases at a young age (Figure 10) [122]. First, HMOs act as prebiotics by promoting commensal bacteria growth and inhibiting pathogen adhesion to the intestinal epithelium. HMO fermentation to SCFAs strengthens epithelial barrier function and modulates immune responses locally and systemically. Second, HMOs boost mucus secretion and tight junction integrity, reinforcing the physical barrier between the intestinal epithelium and the gut content. Thirdly, HMOs directly regulate immune function by influencing the dendritic cell response. Finally, a small fraction of HMOs transported over the intestinal epithelium exert immunomodulatory effects beyond the gut. These HMO-mediated mechanisms may promote immune tolerance and, therefore, potentially prevent allergic diseases.
        Bodinier et al. reviewed the preventive effects and mechanisms of prebiotic oligosaccharides, such as GOSs, FOSs, and other emerging prebiotic oligosaccharides (e.g., XOSs, IMOs), in allergies [123]. The authors summarized two distinct mechanisms (direct and indirect effects) by which prebiotic oligosaccharides can influence host health. Indirect effects were attributed to the SCFAs produced from the fermentation of prebiotic oligosaccharides by gut bacteria, which impact epithelial cells and immune cells and thereby potentially influence the prevention of allergies. On the other hand, the direct function of prebiotic oligosaccharides on the epithelial cells of the lung, skin, gut, and immune system was observed. For example, prebiotic FOSs/GOSs suppressed the excessive production of TSLP, substance P, IL-4, IL-10, and TNF-α, which contributed to the prevention of keratin depletion, an improvement in epidermal biophysical properties, the restoration of skin sebum levels, and a reduced bacterial infection risk. Additionally, prebiotics promoted immune tolerance by increasing CD4+ Foxp3+ Treg cells in skin-draining lymph nodes, inhibiting germline class-switching and IgE production.
      
      
        4.3. Attenuation of Acne Vulgaris (COSs, FOSs, GOSs)
        Acne vulgaris is a common inflammatory skin disease that is closely related to the skin microbiome [124,125]. Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes, formerly Proprionibacterium acnes), a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium, has long been considered as a skin commensal and has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen that contributes to the inflammatory phase of acne [126]. Current acne treatments focus on the use of doxycycline, benzoyl peroxide, isotretinoin, etc. [125], and prebiotic oligosaccharides have been studied as an emerging therapy for acne by restoring the microbial equilibrium or selectively targeting pathogenic strains. For example, Kim et al. reported the antibacterial activities of chitosan oligosaccharides (oligochitosan) against acne-related bacteria, particularly C. acnes [85]. It was found that 10 kDa oligochitosan presented the highest antimicrobial effect with minimum inhibitory concentration values of 32–64 μg/mL on C. acnes. In addition, an antibacterial synergy effect was observed when combining oligochitosan with tetracycline or erythromycin, indicated by a median ΣFIC (fractional inhibitory concentration) range of 0.02–0.56. The mechanism was presumably attributed to the fact that oligochitosan can be stacked over the microbial cell surface, blocking nutrients, or bind to DNA, thus inhibiting transcription or the permeability of the microbial cell wall.
        Furthermore, Ruxton et al. summarized the effects of a novel seaweed oligosaccharide–zinc complex (SOZC) on reducing the symptoms of acne vulgaris [110]. The seaweed oligosaccharides were prepared by the extraction of polysaccharides from brown seaweed (Laminaria digitata), followed by enzymatic depolymerization and, finally, chelating with ZnSO4 to form a zinc complex (Phycosaccharide® AC, The Mentholatum Company, East Kilbride, United Kingdom). In vitro studies proved that 5.6% SOZC reduced C. acnes (contributing to the inflammatory phase of acne) counts by 74%, and SOZC was found to have soothing effects, indicated by increased levels of interleukin 1 alpha by 11.1%. In addition, double-blind human trials suggested that treatment with 5% SOZC significantly improved acne vulgaris symptoms in 14 days, with reduced sensitivity and improved skin healing. The likely mechanisms of action may include antibacterial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects related to brown seaweed, and a synergistic effect might be attributed to the zinc complex.
        A recent human trial study was conducted to investigate the effects of oral supplementation with FOSs and GOSs in women with severe acne [108]. The results suggested that oral FOSs (100 mg) and GOSs (500 mg) for 3 months significantly reduced fasting blood glucose levels (p = 0.02), total cholesterol levels (p = 0.018), and triglycerides (p = 0.05), but there was a nonsignificant decrease in insulin and C-peptide plasma. Overall, oral FOSs and GOSs led to positive effects on glycemic and lipid metabolic parameters in women with adult acne. Additionally, FOS and GOS supplements may reduce systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance, all of which contribute to acne pathogenesis [124].
      
      
        4.4. Skin Hydration, Anti-Dryness, and Anti-Itching (GlcOSs, GOSs, FOSs, Colloidal Oat)
        Prebiotic oligosaccharides are able to improve water retention on the skin and reduce dryness [28,112]. For example, Suh et al. found that the oral administration of prebiotic GOSs and probiotic B. longum was able to prevent transepidermal water loss and reduce erythema formation in hairless mice studies [111]. Berardesca et al. investigated the efficiency of α-gluco-oligosaccharides (α-GlcOSs) and collagen tripeptide F in controlling symptoms in females with sensitive atopic skin (N = 40, 30–59 yrs) [113]. A 4-week treatment (α-GlcOSs in a lotion) was found to significantly improve skin barrier properties, including skin hydration, roughness, skin pH, and transepidermal water loss (TEWL). A clinical assessment indicated reduced dryness, desquamation, and skin irritability after treatment, which helped improve the symptoms of sensitive skin. No significant difference was observed in the number of Staphylococcus colonies after the treatment.
        Kano et al. conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial and found that a daily intake (100 mL, 4 weeks) of Yakult fermented milk containing prebiotic GOSs and probiotic B. breve (YIT 12272) improved skin hydration in healthy adult women (N = 40) [28]. The hydration levels and cathepsin L-like activity (related to keratinocyte differentiation) in the stratum corneum turned out to be significantly higher in the active group, while the serum and urine phenol levels (e.g., phenol, p-cresol, regarded as bioactive toxins) were significantly lower.
        Kim et al. reported that the oral administration of 4.25 g FOS (1-kestose) significantly alleviated itching and sleep disturbance symptoms and improved the skin barrier function in children (N = 48, 2–17 years) with atopic dermatitis through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for 12 weeks [19]. Skin microbiome composition analysis revealed that FOS treatment decreased the abundance of Lachnospiraceae and increased the abundance of Prevotella and Rothia in AD skin, while the control group (maltose) resulted in a decreased abundance of Methylobacterium. Furthermore, FOSs enhanced the skin barrier function by altering the proportion of linoleic acid (18:2) esterified omega-hydroxy-ceramides (EOS-CERs), with significantly decreased levels of amide-linked short-chain fatty acids (C28 and C30). The mechanisms underlying the positive effects of FOSs were attributed to increased expression of ELOVL3 (a key enzyme in the elongation of C16-C22 fatty acids) and FLG (a key epidermal barrier protein that maintains skin barrier function).
        Southall and colleagues reported that the anti-inflammatory activities of colloidal oatmeal (65–85% starch, 15–20% protein, 3–11% lipid, 5% fiber, and 5% β-glucan) and its protective effect for dry, irritated skin [114]. In vivo clinical trials showed that the colloidal oatmeal skin protectant lotion applied on healthy females (N = 29) with itchy, dry skin on their lower legs led to significant improvement in skin dryness, scaling, roughness, and itch intensity during a 2-week application (twice a day). In vitro assays revealed that the extracts of colloidal oatmeal significantly inhibited inflammatory mediators (pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8, NF-κB luciferase promoter levels) associated with skin inflammation and, in turn, enhanced the skin benefits of colloidal oatmeal for dry, irritated, and eczematous skin. In a similar study, Liu-Walsh et al. reported that the 6-week use of a daily moisturizer containing 1% colloidal oat significantly promoted the growth of S. epidermidis ATCC 12228 and increased the concentration of lactic acid (from bacterial fermentation) on the skin of female subjects with skin dryness issues [84]. Lactic acid is considered as a natural moisturizing factor of stratum corneum, which helps to maintain skin hydration and a slightly acidic skin pH [127].
      
      
        4.5. Anti-Aging and Photoprotection (GlcOSs, XOSs, GOSs, COSs)
        Zahr et al. investigated the effects of a moisturizer formulated with prebiotic α-glucan oligosaccharides and postbiotics (Pseudoalteromonas ferment extract) on 25 female subjects (35–65 yrs, mean age 54 ± 6) with Fitzpatrick skin types I–VI, moderate crow’s feet wrinkles, and global face photodamage [26]. A 28-day treatment (twice daily application) significantly increased the microbial facial diversity (α-diversity) and shifted the microbiota composition (e.g., reduced Cutibacterium acnes abundance). In addition, a clinical study suggested a 10.3% average improvement for 85.7% of subjects in tactile firmness (** p < 0.001), a 12.6% average improvement in overall photodamage (*** p < 0.001), and a 25.9% average improvement in full face radiance (** p < 0.001). The results suggested that the multifunctional moisturizer specifically targeted the dermal–epidermal junction (DEJ) and skin microbiome to improve the diversity and balance of the facial microbiome at the species level while providing anti-aging benefits.
        Zhao et al. found that a dual intervention (oral and topical) of xylo-oligosaccharides in human females (N = 77) attenuated facial cutaneous aging, with decreased facial Cutibacterium abundance and enriched intestinal Bifidobacterium [21]. The mechanism was predicted to be the decreased fructose-1-phosphate kinase (encoded by K02770) involved in de novo lipid synthesis, thus inhibiting lipophilic Cutibacterium with reduced facial pores.
        Suh et al. found that the oral treatment of prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (100 mg, 12 weeks) and/or probiotic Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum, 109 CFU) protected against UV-induced skin damage (wrinkle formation, skin thickening, and water loss) in hairless mice [111]. The effect was likely attributed to increased levels of gene (TIMP-1 and Col1) expression related to collagen synthesis and degradation. In addition, the treatment was found to increase the water-holding capacity of the skin, prevent transepidermal water loss, and reduce erythema formation (16.8%) of mice skin after exposure to UV. Similarly, Kim et al. reported the protective effects of dietary GOSs and B. longum against UVB-induced photo-aging and also anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects [116].
        Hong et al. reported the photoprotective effect of dietary GOSs (mainly DP 2–4 with β-(1→4) and β-(1→6) glycosidic bonds) in hairless mice by regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway [115]. The 8-week oral administration of GOSs (200 mg/kg) increased TEWL, decreased the water-holding capacity, and also significantly reduced the wrinkle area and mean wrinkle length in hairless mice exposed to UVB. In addition, GOS ingestion significantly reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α) induced by UVB irradiation. Moreover, GOS intake significantly prevented the UVB-induced MAPK phosphorylation of JNK, p38, and ERK kinases that contributed to skin aging. Similarly, Jung et al. reported that the oral administration of collagen tripeptide and GOS mixtures (3:1, 1:1, and 1:3) showed a synergistic inhibitory effect on photo-aging in UVB-exposed hairless mice through changes in gene expression, cytokine levels, and intestinal microbiota composition [117].
        Kong et al. investigated the potential preventive effects of chitosan oligosaccharides (COSs, average Mw = 1000 Da, degree of deacetylation ≥90%, water-soluble) in UV-irradiated hairless mice skin [27]. A 10-week topical application of COSs at a concentration of 50/100/200 mg/mL was found to effectively alleviate the UV-induced macroscopic and histopathological damage of mice skin by mitigating the disrupted collagen fibers and increasing the content of type I collagen and total collagen. Moreover, COSs inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), significantly enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH-Px, CAT), and increased the content of skin hydroxyproline (positively correlated to dermal collagen) and moisture. The authors therefore concluded that COSs were a promising agent for preventing skin photo-aging and promoting skin health.
        Jiang et al. studied the preparation of succinyl-chitosan oligosaccharides (SU-COSs) and evaluated their protective effects against UVB-induced skin damage both in vitro and in vivo [22]. SU-COSs (6400 Da, substitution degree of 69.26%) showed good biocompatibility with L-929 cells, erythrocytes, and subcutaneous skin in an in vitro hemolysis assay. SU-COSs effectively promoted the 2D and 3D migration of human epidermal HaCaT cells in a scratch migration assay. In vitro SU-COS treatment on UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells enhanced cell viability (increased survival ratio by <11%), maintained cytoskeletal morphology, and stabilized the cell cycle while concurrently reducing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. In vivo studies demonstrated that the SU-COS intervention (200/400 mg/kg) showed a protective effect on UVB-irradiated mice skin by reducing skin erythema and transepidermal water loss, relieving crusting. Furthermore, SU-COSs also maintained the integrity of the epidermis and skin thickness, as well as the stability of collagen fibers. The protective effects of SU-COSs were correlated with the modulation of gene and protein expression associated with the cellular cycle, collagen synthesis, extracellular matrix degradation, antioxidant defense, and anti-inflammation properties. Taken together, SU-COSs were identified as a potential treatment for repairing UVB-induced photodamage.
        Zhao et al. reported a protective effect of Panax ginseng oligosaccharides (GSOs) against skin barrier damage induced by UVB [118]. The GSOs (1000 Da) were composed of seven monosaccharide units (62.2% glucose, 9.0% galacturonic acid, 8.4% galactose, 5.8% arabinose, 5.5% glucuronic acid, 5.1% mannose, 3.9% rhamnose) linked by β-bonds. Topical treatment (0.2/1.0/2.0 mg/cm2/day) of GOSs on the dorsal skin of BALB/c hairless mice reduced UVB-induced epidermal thickening and moisture loss. Specifically, the GSOs attenuated UVB-induced skin dryness by increasing the expression of related proteins (CE and AQP3). In addition, GSO treatment reduced desquamation both in vivo and in vitro (using HaCaT cells) by enhancing the expression of desquamation-related proteins (SPINK5, KLK5, KLK7, and DSG1).
      
      
        4.6. Mechanism of Action of Oligosaccharides
        Table 4 summarizes the key pathways through which different oligosaccharides exert their skin health benefits, highlighting the importance of the administration route (oral vs. topical) in determining their mechanisms of action. Orally administered oligosaccharides, such as HMOs, GOSs, and FOSs, primarily modulate the gut–skin axis by promoting the production of SCFAs (e.g., butyrate, acetate), which regulate immune responses (e.g., IL-10, Treg cells) and enhance skin barrier function. These systemic effects are particularly effective in alleviating conditions like atopic dermatitis and improving hydration. Furthermore, topically applied oligosaccharides, including COSs and GlcOSs, directly interact with skin microbiota and keratinocytes, targeting pathways like MAPK and NF-κB to reduce oxidative stress, inflammation, and UV-induced damage, making them ideal for anti-aging and photoprotection. The distinction underscores how route-specific delivery optimizes therapeutic outcomes—oral for systemic immune modulation and topical for localized skin repair and microbiome balance.
      
    
    
      5. Commercial Cosmetic Compositions Containing Prebiotic Oligosaccharides
      An early patent described the addition of gluco-oligosaccharides (5% by weight, produced by the France company BIOEUROPE) in a series of cosmetic products, including liquid soap, shampoo, body milk (emulsion), face cream (emulsion), and vaginal gel [97]. The gluco-oligosaccharides were prepared from maltose and glucosyltransferase derived from the strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRLL B-1299, which produced α-(1→6)- and α-(1→2)-linked glucose oligomers with DP in the range of 3–7.
      Ecoskin® (Solabia, Pantin, France) is a prebiotic and probiotic complex (in liquid form) formulated with two prebiotic oligosaccharides and probiotic Lactobacillus strains (L. casei and L. acidophilus, with a reported effective dose of 1–5% (w/w) [128]. The two prebiotic oligosaccharides were α-gluco-oligosaccharides (GlcOSs), produced by enzymatic synthesis from plant substrates (α-glucan oligosaccharides), and β-fructo-oligosaccharides, prepared from Yacon tubers (Polymnia sonchifolia) via cold pressing [6]. This patented ingredient was reported to promote the growth and development of beneficial skin commensals and defend the skin from environmental pollutants (up to 2.5 μm) that accelerate aging [129].
      Bioecolia® (Solabia, Pantin, France) is a prebiotic product (in powder form) containing α-glucan-oligosaccharides that are produced via enzymatic transglycosylation from saccharose (sucrose) and maltose [130]. Structurally, the α-glucan oligosaccharides are composed of glucose units linked by α-(1→6) and α-(1→2) glycosidic bonds. The specific linkage types allow bioselective, fast, and efficient metabolism of the prebiotic by skin microbes. Specifically, 0.1% Bioecolia® promoted the growth of commensal S. epidermidis MFP04 and marginally increased the cytotoxicity of S. epidermidis on HaCaT keratinocytes at 1.0% (not enhancing biofilm formation activity) [131]. Bioecolia® was patented for its use as a medication for the treatment of uncomfortable skin/external mucosa and vulvar dryness and/or pruritus and/or vulvar burns [132].
      Glycolift® (Solabia, Pantin, France) is a tensing and firming agent containing alginate, α-glucan oligosaccharides, and plant propanediol. Glycolift® is used as an anti-aging tensor by optimizing rheological properties and forming a matrix for instant and prolonged tensing and smoothing action [133]. In addition, it also balances the skin microbiome and acts against atmospheric, UV, and domestic pollutants by forming a non-occlusive matrix. Glycolift® is formulated for facial tensing, reducing wrinkles, and radiant care.
      Lancôme®, a luxury skincare brand owned by L’Oréal (Paris, France), offers facial serums, sheet masks, eye creams, etc. According to the product label, some Lancôme® products (e.g., facial serums, moisturizers) contain prebiotic α-glucan oligosaccharides that help support a healthy skin microbiome and reduce symptoms of sensitive skin [13]. Other oligosaccharides include trehalose as a moisturizer and maltodextrin as a stabilizer, binding agent, film-forming agent, and skin softener.
      Aveeno® (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) is a clinically validated skincare brand that specializes in dry skin relief, offering products ranging from body washes to moisturizing lotion. Its FDA-approved active ingredient, prebiotic colloidal oatmeal, exhibits multiple benefits in cleansing, buffering, moisturizing, protecting, soothing, anti-irritant, antioxidant, and anti-inflammation properties [134]. Chemically, colloidal oatmeal consists of 65–85% starch, 15–20% protein, 3–11% lipid, 5% fiber, and 5% β-glucan [13]. The high concentrations of starch and β-glucans offer protective and water-holding functions through humectant and film-forming effects, and the presence of different types of phenols confers antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and UV-absorbing activities [134]. The anti-inflammatory properties, improvement in dry, irritated skin, and enhancement in skin barrier functions have been substantiated and discussed [84,114].
    
    
      6. Conclusions and Future Prospects
      This review comprehensively summarized multiple roles of prebiotic oligosaccharides in promoting skin health and their burgeoning applications in the cosmetic industry. Prebiotic oligosaccharides, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOSs), fructo-oligosaccharides (FOSs), gluco-oligosaccharides (GlcOSs), and others, have demonstrated significant potential in modulating the skin microbiota, thereby conferring a range of skin health benefits. These benefits encompass the promotion of beneficial skin commensals, the inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, anti-melanogenesis, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, wound healing, the prevention of atopic dermatitis and allergies, enhanced skin hydration, and anti-drying, anti-aging, and photoprotection properties. The mechanisms underlying these benefits are primarily attributed to the selective utilization of prebiotic oligosaccharides by beneficial skin microorganisms, leading to the production of metabolites, such as SCFAs, that modulate the skin environment and immune responses. Additionally, these oligosaccharides can directly inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects through various molecular pathways. The emerging understanding of the structure–function relationships of prebiotic oligosaccharides further highlights their potential for targeted skin health interventions.
      Despite the promising findings, several challenges and future directions should be addressed before the practical application of prebiotic oligosaccharides as cosmetic formulations. First, the structure–function relationship of oligosaccharides requires deeper investigation to elucidate how molecular characteristics (monomer composition, DP, glycosidic linkages) dictate their biological activity. This would enable the rational design of novel oligosaccharides from green and sustainable feedstocks (e.g., cellulose, lignocellulosic biomass). Second, rigorous clinical trials are needed to validate the efficacy and safety of prebiotic oligosaccharides. More importantly, mechanistic studies should be devoted to fully understanding the skin–gut microbiota–host interactions and connection to skin health effects. Finally, it is essential to consider the regulatory requirements for cosmetic products and distinguish them from health products. For example, in Europe, cosmetic claim requirements should follow EU Regulation 1223/2009 and 655/2013, while health products should follow European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidelines. Standardized protocols should be established for the production and quality control of prebiotic oligosaccharides for application in the cosmetic industry.

Title: Spirulina as a Key Ingredient in the Evolution of Eco-Friendly Cosmetics

Abstract: Limnospira spp., commercially known as spirulina, is widely recognized for its remarkable benefits due to its rich composition of bioactive compounds like phycobiliproteins, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds. These natural bioactive compounds not only serve as colorants but also offer potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anticancer, antimicrobial, and anti-aging properties. As a result, spirulina and its components are increasingly used in cosmetic formulations to promote skin hydration, reduce wrinkles, and protect against UV radiation damage. Its bioactive components enhance fibroblast growth, boost collagen production, and prevent premature skin aging by inhibiting enzymes responsible for elastin degradation. Additionally, spirulina-based cosmetics have demonstrated wound-healing properties without genotoxic effects, with formulations containing C-phycocyanin particularly effective in shielding skin cells from UV-induced apoptosis. Despite these well-established benefits, there remains significant potential for the cosmetic industry to harness spirulina’s capabilities further. Research into the molecular mechanisms underlying its bioactive compounds in cosmetic formulations is still in its early stages, offering many opportunities for innovation. Emerging fields of biotechnology, such as nanotechnology and biocosmetics, could enhance the stability, efficacy, and delivery of spirulina-based ingredients, unlocking new possibilities for skin protection and rejuvenation. Furthermore, its proven biological properties align perfectly with the increasing consumer demand for safe, sustainable, and nature-inspired skincare solutions.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Cosmetics are products applied to the human body for various purposes, including cleansing, healing, sun protection, antimicrobial effects, anti-aging, anti-cellulite treatment, moisturizing, beautification, perfuming, or altering appearance—all while ensuring no harm to human health. Millions of people use these products daily to maintain hygiene, enhance well-being, and improve their quality of life in pursuing beauty [1]. Natural ingredients and vitamins are vital in promoting cell renewal and protecting light-exposed skin, especially on the face [2]. On the other hand, synthetic ingredients commonly found in conventional cosmetics, such as coloring agents, have raised concerns. These compounds may trigger allergic reactions, particularly in individuals with dermatological sensitivities [3]. Beyond skin irritation, specific synthetic components are associated with broader health risks, toxicological issues, and environmental concerns [4,5,6], highlighting the growing importance of safer, more sustainable alternatives in cosmetic formulations.
      Research on bioactive compounds derived from natural sources has gained significant traction in the cosmetic industry, driven by the growing demand for healthier, sustainable, safe, and eco-friendly products. This trend has emphasized the feasibility of using aquatic organisms, including marine and freshwater species, as valuable ingredients for personal care formulations Reviews conducted by Wang et al. [1], Mellou et al. [7], Morocho-Jácome et al. [8], Zhuang et al. [9], Hernández Muñoz et al. [10], and Mourelle et al. [11] have summarized various renewable marine organisms suitable for cosmetics, highlighting a diverse range of ingredients with unique beneficial properties, as well as the economic interest in this field. Among these organisms, microalgae and cyanobacteria stand out due to their rich metabolic diversity and bioactive compounds, particularly natural pigments like carotenoids, chlorophylls, and phycobiliproteins [8]. These pigments not only add color but also offer health-promoting benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities [12,13].
      Of the many algae studied for cosmetic use, spirulina offers distinctive advantages compared to other marine and freshwater species. Its high protein content, abundance of essential amino acids, and rich supply of bioactive compounds—especially phycocyanin, a unique blue pigment with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties—make it well-suited for skin regeneration, photoprotection, and anti-aging applications. Unlike many macroalgae that require specific marine conditions, spirulina is highly adaptable to diverse cultivation systems, including low-cost, sustainable setups, and it produces stable pigments with proven efficacy. While other algae also contribute beneficial compounds such as polysaccharides and carotenoids, spirulina’s metabolic profile and functional versatility are more extensively documented and technologically exploited. Recent reviews on patent trends confirm that spirulina is gaining ground in cosmeceutical innovation, not only due to its efficacy but also for its compatibility with advanced delivery systems like nanoemulsions and encapsulation technologies, further enhancing its appeal for high-performance, natural cosmetic formulations [10,11].
      Among cyanobacteria, Limnospira platensis, previously known as Arthrospira platensis and commercialized as spirulina, has become the most widely used cyanobacterium for animal and human nutrition. Its popularity stems from its substantial nutritional value. Several strains of spirulina have been certified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) owing to their lack of harmful effects on human health [14]. Spirulina can thrive in extreme environmental conditions, such as high alkalinity, salinity, and temperature, making it adaptable to various cultivation methods, including wastewater reuse in open and closed batch systems [15,16,17].
      Although historically classified under the genus Spirulina, more recent morphological and molecular studies have shown that commercially cultivated strains exhibit distinct genetic and structural characteristics. This led first to their reclassification as Arthrospira and, more recently, to the definition of a new genus, Limnospira. The taxonomic revision aims to reflect the monophyletic nature of the cultivated lineages and their differences from the original type species. This reclassification has direct implications for the standardization of scientific nomenclature, regulatory frameworks for derived products, and the direction of future research [18,19,20]. The validity of this new classification has been reinforced by approaches combining genomic, morphological, and ecological data, which reveal phenotypic traits and growth patterns specific to Limnospira. This scientific redefinition enhances taxonomic accuracy and supports the development of safer and more effective biotechnological applications [21,22].
      In recent decades, spirulina has garnered attention in academic research, focusing on its production [23], scale-up processes [24], and its bioactive compounds [25,26,27,28]. Additionally, research has focused on its application in food products [29,30,31]. Despite these advancements, original studies examining spirulina and its derivatives in cosmetic formulations remain sparse, particularly in product development for cosmetics and hair care [32]. Although the potential of spirulina for cosmetic applications is well-supported due to its well-documented composition and free radical scavenging abilities, there is a notable gap in understanding its interactions with other formulation components. Existing research has yet to thoroughly investigate spirulina’s molecular interaction with cosmetic vehicles, its physical properties, its spreadability, its stability, the release rates of its active compounds, and its clinical effects when applied in biomass or byproduct forms. Further research addressing these aspects could unlock new opportunities for incorporating spirulina into innovative and effective cosmetic products.
      More recently, a review published by Ragusa et al. [33] highlighted spirulina as a promising ingredient for cosmetic formulations due to its anti-aging, revitalizing, remineralizing, and moisturizing properties for skin and hair. Similarly, Ikeda et al. [33] explored the interaction between spirulina biomass and its derivatives in dermatology, covering studies conducted on mice, in vivo and in vitro research, gene expression analysis, and cell proliferation. However, both reviews emphasized the scarcity of clinical studies on spirulina’s efficacy, and neither explored the integration of spirulina with emerging technologies like nanotechnology, 3D bioprinting, or biocosmetics development.
      This work aims to bridge that gap by focusing on the current applications of spirulina and its components in cosmetics and beauty-related products, emphasizing their advantages and outcomes in the personal care industry. Furthermore, it aims to identify recent scientific findings and address future trends, particularly in cosmetics, where natural ingredients like spirulina are increasingly paired with cutting-edge technologies to meet consumer demand for innovative, sustainable products. Understanding the full potential of spirulina in cosmetics will require further research into its molecular mechanisms and interaction with emerging cosmetic technologies.
    
    
      2. Material and Methods: Bibliographic Data Analysis
      A search was conducted in the Elsevier Scopus database (https://www.scopus.com/, accessed in 1 January 2025) to understand the critical aspects of spirulina biomass in biocosmetics and other beauty-related products through the search term ((((“Spirulina” AND “platensis” OR “phycocyanin” OR “c-phycocyanin” OR “biomass” OR “residual biomass”) AND (“biocosmetics” OR “cosmetics” OR “dermatology” OR “rinse off” OR “leave on” OR “makeup” OR “beauty”)))), and it returned 124 documents. The search term was determined so that the maximum number of studies related to cosmetics and spirulina could be obtained for the investigation.
      These findings composed the bibliometric overlay visualization map (Figure 1). It was done over VosViewer (software version 1.16.19, Leiden University, Leiden, the Netherlands). The sizes of the circles and labels are directly dependent on the weight; that is, the greater the occurrence of the term, the larger the dimensions of the circles and labels will be. The closer circles are more frequently published together, and the default colors range from blue (previous years) to green to yellow (last years), which are shown in the bottom right corner of the visualization [27]. Therefore, “Spirulina” was related to “biotechnology” and “diet supplementation” around 2014, and more recently, “Spirulina” is more related to “cosmetics.” This well-founded observation can justify the lack of studies linking spirulina to cosmetics since it is an emerging field of study. Nevertheless, the application of spirulina has gained a wide variety for several industries, such as pharmaceutics, food, and feed and biofuels, once more evidencing its potential to be explored and the possibility of cooperation between industries, when considering the use of byproducts in different sectors.
      As exclusion criteria on the Elsevier Scopus database, the type of document (limited to articles) and the years of publication were chosen, which comprised the period from 2013 to 2024. Thereby, 57 articles were collected. Interestingly, only 15.78% of this total were original articles studying specific properties of spirulina and its application in cosmetics. Further studies based on personal care products were included from the initial readings. As a result, the most relevant studies for this review were covered and comprised the following sections.
    
    
      3. Spirulina Production and Recovery
      Production is an essential point for any industry. From this point of view, information regarding the pros and cons of spirulina as a candidate in the biocosmetics sector regarding production, upstream and downstream, must be considered without underestimating the importance of critical points like scale-up, productivity, and economy. Spirulina represents 30% of the 10,000 tons of dry-weight algal biomass produced globally in the microalgae industry [34]. Upstream processes can be considered microalgae and cyanobacteria research’s baseline. These activities directly impact biomass quality and quantity, making them commercially and technically essential. They also evolve processes such as bioreactor design, culture medium preparation, CO2 supplementation, and environmental factor adjustment and control [35]. Besides the cultivation medium, photobioreactors for microalgal culture have been examined for design and operation. The main pillars of the upstream process in microalgae research include different cultivation modes, photobioreactor design, culture media preparation, microalgae supply, environmental factors, and microalgal growth monitoring [35].
      Spirulina is primarily grown in low-cost, easy-to-build, and maintained open ponds. These systems have low biomass yield, high evaporation rates, and difficulties maintaining ideal culture settings and are susceptible to contamination. Spirulina is less susceptible to contamination as a cyanobacterium that grows at increased pH (9.5 to 11.0). The productivity of biomass and other metabolites with biotechnological interest depends on the cultivation medium. Three media from the literature were selected in this study: Zarrouk’s, Hiri’s, and Jourdan’s. Spirulina production is affected by medium nitrogen concentration and nitrogen source. Light intensity significantly affects spirulina production, interfering with any photosynthetic organism [36]. Harvesting and dewatering are needed to remove biomass from culture media. The literature reports using coagulants to reduce membrane fouling and increase filtration flow, improving microalgae harvesting. Besides, the first step in downstream processing is cell disruption, which involves breaking the cell wall and membranes to release high-value components from the cytoplasm and internal organelles [37,38,39]. Figure 2 summarizes the spirulina cultivation, harvesting, and handling process.
      After the products are liberated from the cells, several extraction and fractionation methods must be utilized to separate proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates from the biomass. All remaining components must be functional. Separating and purifying extracted products yields specified products. Purification includes distillation and membrane filtering [39]. All those steps will depend on the application of the spirulina and its components as ingredients; each added step increases the cost, so comprehending the added value of each potential ingredient will also determine the final feature of the cosmetic formulated with these components.
      The sustainability of spirulina stands on an environmental, economic, and social basis. The cultivation process using wastewater and photobioreactors has gained environmental notoriety since it does not depend on soil, as agriculture usually does [16]. In this sense, semiarid climatic conditions and uncommon cultivable soils could fit its production, also generating wealth and employment. Furthermore, spirulina cultivation requires fewer areas compared to conventional vegetable cultivation farms and in closed photobioreactors, which can double the biomass concentration every 2–5 days. Therefore, replacing synthetic and natural assets derived from vegetables with more sustainable and profitable cultivation fields is also a sustainable alternative [40].
      Spirulina cultivation requires CO2 for photosynthesis, contributing to reducing the carbon footprint and global warming. The acquisition of this green technology will allow many companies to reduce their carbon footprint and effluent production, achieving environmental sustainability and reducing the economic cost of these companies. Besides, in photosynthesis, O2 is released into the atmosphere, thus benefiting the environment [41]. A drawback in spirulina cultivation is the high cost of the chemical-based culture medium due to their high nutritional value. Therefore, alternative forms have been evaluated to reduce the cost of this chemical-based culture medium, and wastewater is a promising alternative nutrient source. Wastewater is enriched with nitrogen and phosphorus, making replacing the compositions in the chemical-based culture medium possible [42].
      Different wastewaters, such as industrial, aquaculture, and domestic, could be used as a substrate for spirulina cultivation after less complex filtration, dilution, and supplementation treatments. Although prior treatments for wastewater are necessary, using wastewater as a cultivation medium for spirulina can solve part of the environmental pollution problems and achieve a sustainable circular economy [41].
      The upscaling of spirulina cultivation entails considerable technical complexities, notably in achieving effective contamination control and maintaining uniform quality at an industrial scale. Nevertheless, spirulina represents a strategic and environmentally sustainable alternative for protein production, offering a solution with a markedly lower ecological impact than conventional sources. Promoting the advancement of cultivation technologies specifically adapted to regional climate and market conditions is essential to ensure spirulina’s commercial viability and promote it as an active ingredient in cosmetic formulations considered environmentally friendly [43].
      Spirulina’s unique characteristics and potential for sustainable production make it a promising alternative to traditional crops and animal products in terms of minimizing carbon emissions and promoting food security. Besides, spirulina cultivation presents a significantly more sustainable option for reducing the carbon footprint and mitigating global warming compared to conventional crops. Unlike these land-intensive crops, which require fertile arable land and substantial freshwater inputs and are often associated with deforestation and ecosystem disruption, spirulina can be grown in closed photobioreactors on marginal, non-arable land with minimal freshwater use and without reliance on climatic conditions. Its rapid growth rate, exceptionally high protein content (up to 70%), and dense nutritional profile—surpassing that of beef in key micronutrients—make it a highly efficient food source. Additionally, spirulina production generates markedly lower greenhouse gas emissions, especially when compared to livestock systems and the input-heavy cultivation of feed crops like maize and sugarcane. These advantages position spirulina as a technologically advanced, resource-efficient, and climate-resilient alternative that can meaningfully contribute to a sustainable food future [44,45,46].
    
    
      4. Spirulina and Its Components: Biological Effects
      Limnospira platensis and Limnospira maxima, previously named Spirulina platensis and Spirulina maxima, are the best-known species [47]. Cultivation usually takes place at a pH greater than 9.5, which inhibits the growth of contaminating microorganisms [48] in a simple production process with significant economic impact, where spirulina’s byproducts can originate biofuels [17] biodegradable food packaging [49,50,51], the source for food and feed [52,53,54,55,56,57], and health and pharmaceuticals [27], thus mitigating waste and contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it is considered a highly sustainable resource [33].
      Spirulina is a cyanobacterium capable of transforming solar energy into chemical energy. Its cultivation occurs on photobioreactors or opened systems with wastewater [17,58,59]. The acquired biomass is rich in proteins (for about 60%), carbohydrates (24%), and fatty acids (7%) [60], in addition to vitamins and phycobiliproteins, namely C-phycocyanin (C-PC), allophycocyanin, and phycoerythrin [61]; carotenoids; and chlorophylls and phenolic compounds, in other words, bioactive compounds of great interest for industrial application due to antioxidant activity. The blue pigment C-PC is usually the target one due to its vast majority and antioxidant activity [12], acting as a free radicals’ scavenger that leads to anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory [26], anticancer [27,62], and antimicrobial effects [63].
      Regarding cosmetics application, the antioxidant activity is related to anti-aging; preventing and reducing the formation of wrinkles, expression lines, and stretch marks [1,64]; hydration and oil control of the skin [65]; and reducing the harmful effects of UV radiation, protecting the skin and hair [66]. As a natural ingredient derived from sustainable biomass, C-PC is an excellent antioxidant suitable as a colorant for biocosmetic formulations, notwithstanding their moisturizing, healing, anti-aging, whitening, and anti-acne actions [33].
      Additionally, studies have shown that extracts containing isolated compounds from microalgae, such as proteins, vitamins, and fatty acids, promote biological effects similar to those obtained with pure biomass. These isolated compounds have demonstrated efficacy in various applications, both in health and cosmetics. For example, microalgal proteins can aid tissue repair and strengthening, while vitamins provide antioxidant properties and essential nutrients. Fatty acids, in turn, are known for their anti-inflammatory and moisturizing capabilities [67,68].
      Various cosmetic products incorporating microalgae are already available on the market, offering proven benefits for skin and hair. These products ensure deep hydration, promoting skin and hair softness, strength, and shine. Additionally, spirulina contains a high concentration of C-FC, mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), and other substances that can help protect the skin from damage caused by free radicals and sun exposure. Thus, using microalgae in cosmetics enhances aesthetic appearance and contributes to the overall health of skin and hair [66,69].
      Cutaneous aging brings concerns from both an aesthetic and clinical standpoint. Due to the chronological effect, the natural aging process is related to intrinsic factors. However, external factors, such as ultraviolet radiation, are responsible for skin aging. Both cases cause malfunctioning of cutaneous tissues, with degradation of essential components for skin health and integrity, such as collagen and elastin [70,71].
      Spirulina has shown the ability to act on fibroblasts and keratinocytes, with the potential against types of premature aging, promoting cell proliferation, inhibition of enzymes responsible for premature aging, and antioxidant capacity, protecting the skin from oxidative stress and inflammation. In an in vitro study using a human dermal fibroblast cell line, the crude protein extract from spirulina biomass showed the ability to increase the levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while inhibiting the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 8 (MMP-8), enzymes related to premature aging. Furthermore, the extract promoted increased fibroblast growth and collagen production (42% and 142%, respectively, compared to the control) and inhibited enzymes responsible for elastin degradation [72].
      A study evaluated the action of the ethanolic extract of spirulina against damage caused by UVB radiation. The extract reversed UV radiation-induced damage, such as cell viability and senescence, DNA damage, and destruction of skin fibroblasts. The optimized extracts were applied to normal human fibroblasts and exposed to UVB radiation. In vitro analyses demonstrated the inhibition of DNA damage caused by UVB radiation, such as pyrimidine dimers, as well as a significant reduction in cell cycle arrest and senescence in dermal fibroblasts through the decrease in the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 [73]. In the same line of investigation, Mapoung et al. [74] also assessed the phenolic extract of spirulina against UVB radiation, showing a high absorption capacity, registering a sun protection factor of 30. The same extract was applied to fibroblasts exposed to UVB radiation, reducing intracellular oxygen free radical levels (ROS) and inhibiting inflammatory cytokine synthesis (IL-6 and IL-8). The authors inferred that these biological effects are associated with the high concentration of phenolic compounds in spirulina biomass [74].
      As previously mentioned, the blue pigment extracted from spirulina biomass is a valuable compound with high antioxidant action. It is responsible for a large part of the biological effects presented by cyanobacteria. C-PC was extracted from spirulina biomass, and its protective effects against UVB radiation were evaluated. Human dermal fibroblast and epidermal keratinocyte cell lines were incubated with C-PC for 24 h, and their action against UVB-induced apoptotic cell death was assessed. The results indicate that treatment with phycobiliprotein increased the expression of heme-oxygenase-1, a protein associated with combating oxidative stress. Furthermore, the treatment increased the expression of anti-apoptotic factors while reducing pro-apoptotic factors and blocked chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation induced by UVB radiation [75]. Thus, in addition to spirulina biomass, isolated compounds such as C-PC can protect skin cells against the apoptotic effects of ultraviolet radiation.
      Few studies have explored the biological effects of spirulina or its blue pigment incorporated into cosmetic formulations. Gunes et al. [76] developed a body cream incorporated with spirulina extract, and its cytotoxic, genotoxic, and wound-healing effects were evaluated in vitro. The skin cream, including 1.125% Spirulina platensis crude extract, showed a more significant wound-healing effect on keratinocyte cell lines and greater cell viability. The creams showed no genotoxic effects on human peripheral blood cells. In addition, collagen production was increased in cell lines treated with skin cream incorporated with spirulina extract at the same concentration mentioned earlier [76].
      Based on the provided text, spirulina and its compounds, such as C-PC, demonstrate promising anti-aging effects and skin protection. In vitro studies indicate that spirulina can promote cell proliferation, inhibit enzymes responsible for premature aging, increase collagen production, protect against damage caused by UV radiation, and benefit wound healing. This suggests great potential for using spirulina and its compounds in cosmetic formulations. Figure 3 connects the main compounds in spirulina biomass and describes their biological effects on skin and hair health.
    
    
      5. Application of Spirulina in Personal Care Products
      Microalgae and cyanobacteria present a significant number of components with industrial potential. However, they are understudied and undervalued. Marine, freshwater, and terrestrial species number in the thousands, and this large number of species inherently includes biochemical compound diversity. The biochemical potential for economic exploitation is countless, significantly because environmental factors change the biochemical composition and produce bioactive compounds, increasing the obtaining of different metabolites according to the variation of the cultivation parameters and conditions. They differ categorically (microalgae are eukaryotic, and cyanobacteria are prokaryotic). Nevertheless, both perform photosynthesis, and cultivation concepts and problems coincide and are comparable regarding industrial potential [77].
      A common point of interest is the non-toxicity of spirulina and its derivatives for topical applications with remarkable coloring capacity. As color is a critical feature when choosing products, the health claim about its natural and renewable source leads to high value and innovation. Positively, spirulina biomass was incorporated into cosmetic formulations without significantly modifying rheological parameters [33]. It should be mentioned that the possibility of using dried or aqueous extract solution is an excellent strategy for better handling with physical properties, which is an advantage.
      In the specialized literature, much is said about phytochemical complexes, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and phenolic compounds, but no recent study has focused on applying them. For elucidation, phenolic compounds from spirulina encapsulated as liposomes presented antifusarium properties with slower release than phenolics without encapsulation [78]. Still, to the present, it has not been clinically tested, even though liposomes are excellent vehicles for delivering active ingredients to the deeper layers of the skin.
      Predominantly, the studies did not specify what “Spirulina extract” means, whether commercially or laboratory obtained. For example, the dried extract of Karray et al. [79] and the resuspended spirulina extract applied by Infante et al. [80] seem to be C-PC, but it was not characterized. None of the summarized studies below (Table 1) have evaluated the purity of the active ingredient. Moreover, a stability test was carried out at 50 °C, an elevated temperature that does not necessarily emulate the actual daily storage of the product, and instability was identified after two weeks. Table 1 uses the nomenclature for spirulina as presented by the original authors of each publication. This approach preserves the context of the original studies. It highlights the variability in taxonomic classification found throughout the literature, despite the current academic consensus, based on recent studies, that considers the genus Limnospira more appropriate.
      In addition, when the temperature was 4 °C, the authors observed blue exudate in the creams loaded with C-PC and moringa in contrast to the stability in C-PC and pomegranate formulation after three weeks [79]. The authors concluded that pomegranate protected spirulina from fermentation, but the microbiological test did not indicate contamination; therefore, further analyses should be carried out to understand the stability of the product.
      Among cosmetics for daily use, shampoo is one of the most frequently used formulations [4]. The study by Silva et al. [81] proved the effectiveness of hair formulations made with 0.1% spirulina extract in strengthening the hair fiber, reducing combability, and increasing the shine of the strands. Resourcefully, the biodegradable composite developed by Adli et al. [82] is highly creative since it brings together a film for personal care (e.g., face or hair mask) and a way of rapidly delivering C-PC through a thin layer—economically appealing since it is an expensive bioproduct [10].
      Besides the need for clinical studies, more sensory acceptance analysis must be done. Sensorial acceptance plays a crucial role in marketing, and just Delsin et al. [65] and Infante et al. [80] conducted a sensory evaluation with more than ten volunteers. Delsin et al. [65] also evaluated the group for a considerable time (28 days) and compared the groups by age.

        5.1. Biocosmetics
        To understand the evolution of biocosmetics in the world industry, it is necessary to know that it is linked to the awareness of a portion of the population of the harmful effects of some substances that were used in conventional cosmetics, which, many times, caused hypersensitivity of the dermis, dermatitis, among other allergic reactions [87]. The first biocosmetic prominence took place in the 70s, when cosmetology was in evidence in scientific and social movements as they sought alternatives that did not bring environmental damage or human health, so natural and organic cosmetics emerged as an alternative to meet the needs of personal well-being without all the problems related to chemical substances that have adverse health effects that are present in conventional cosmetics [88].
        Biocosmetics is a term used for natural cosmetics mainly consisting of organic ingredients, free from chemical fertilizers and free substances such as dyes and synthetic fragrances, silicones, and petroleum derivatives. The bioproduct must also not contain anything of animal origin and must not be tested on them. In the 1990s, the cosmetics industry in Brazil and worldwide began to adapt to new consumers willing to pay more for natural and organic cosmetics, considering the entire production chain with a view towards an ecological and sustainable process, preserving the environment and the quality of life of future generations [89]. Additionally, biocosmetics are produced from 100% natural ingredients, free of pesticides and chemical fertilizers in the cultivation of raw materials, using techniques related to green chemistry in the extraction and production processes. The market for natural organic cosmetics has increased significantly, and the projection is for greater demand for these products [90]. Due to the increase in the consumer market and the need to develop formulations using compounds less aggressive to health and the environment, researchers are turning to discover natural actives that provide effective action in skin and hair treatment, increasing the action potential of substances already used or leading to modifications in the forms of obtaining and processing and the delivery system of natural actives [87].
      
      
        5.2. Hair Cosmetics and the Composition of Shampoos
        Shampoos are an essential and probably the most used hair product, developed to clean leather and hair. In antiquity, soaps were used for this purpose, and the first shampoo only came into existence less than a century ago, around 1933; with the advancement of shampoo technology, its chemical composition can range from 10 to 30 ingredients with different functions, which can be classified as (i) cleaning agents, (ii) conditioning agents, and (iii) active ingredients and additives. The biological function of hair is to protect the scalp, but it also plays an essential role in self-esteem and self-perception of beauty [3]. The scalp is one of the most absorbent parts of the body; since the ingredients contained in hair formulations fall directly into the bloodstream, it is vital to assess their safety for our body [4,5].
        For cleaning to occur, the component responsible for performing this function is a surfactant or detergent. These are anionic surfactants, molecules with an amphoteric structure capable of binding to aqueous and fat-soluble components, removing dirt and excess sebum from the hair [3]. Foam is not synonymous with cleanliness, but it is one of the factors that most attract consumers when choosing shampoo. Secondary surfactants or co-surfactants can increase foam, such as betaines, among which the best known is cocoamidopropyl betaine, usually obtained in a 30% aqueous solution [86].
        Currently, the requirements for a good shampoo go beyond its ability to foam and clean; it is necessary to maintain the health of the strands [4] without causing dryness and allergic reactions. Frequent surfactant exposure can cause skin dryness and irritation [65]. Among the primary surfactants, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), widely found in shampoos, soaps, and products related to skin cleansing, has more significant irritant potential due to its high cleaning potential, which can provide irritability in the same proportion and can cause long-term damage such as dryness [5], skin peeling, hair growth problems, and allergies [91].
        The term “sulfate-free” is designated to products free of this type of surfactant, the sulfates. This category of products has emerged in the last two decades due to consumer concerns about alkyl sulfate and alkyl ether sulfate products and their possible skin and eye irritations [92]. Among them, sodium isethionate (SCI) has wide application in personal care products, especially in bar products, with cleaning and foaming, due to its compatibility with the skin, softness, and emollient properties. It is essential to consider that the pH of shampoos must be close to the natural value of the hair and scalp (5.5–6.0) [5]; unlike soaps, shampoos with alkaline pH can cause damage to the hair. The study by Jeraal et al. [93] reveals that the high activity of SCI at neutral pH improves its skin compatibility, thus reducing the effects of negative charges compared to soaps and alkyl sulfates. Additionally, SCI is derived from a renewable source, produced on a large scale from the hydrolysis of coconut oil, obtaining a mixture of carboxylic acids—between octanoic acid (C8) and octadecanoic acid (C18). Therefore, it is a more natural and ecological alternative to conventional surfactants.
        Conditioning agents are also applied in formulations to impart softness, increase manageability and shine of the hair, balance the negative static charges of cleaning agents, and reduce frizz [3]. Some of these conditioning components are fatty alcohols (for example, cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol), vegetable oils, and butter [3,5], which are applied with an emollient action and offer nutrition to the hair. In addition to surfactants and conditioning agents, active ingredients and additives are also used in shampoo formulation. While additives generally provide color and aroma, active ingredients, with activities such as antioxidant action and increased hydration, are included in formulations that benefit the hair [5]. The study by Castro et al. [32] presented the formulation of three solid shampoos containing 1% (w/w) C-PC, 5% (w/w) spirulina biomass and 5% (w/w) spirulina residual biomass (obtained after C-PC extraction). The physical-chemical characterization produced results within the ranges established by Brazilian legislation for all evaluated parameters. According to the microbiological analysis results, all samples are safe and sanitary. All pigmented shampoos had higher antioxidant activity and phenolic compound content than the control shampoo, and the formulation made with spirulina biomass had more excellent stability in its pigmenting action, as did the antioxidant activity when the two methods were studied in the evaluation of this parameter during the evaluated period.
        More recently, a study used isolated proteins extracted from spirulina for application in hair treatment cream. The treatment was carried out for 9 days, and the results indicate that the formulation containing the spirulina protein isolate increased hair moisture and hydration, in addition to maintaining the integrity of the hair cuticles through the increase in keratin, resulting in stronger hair and offering a better overall appearance [88].
      
    
    
      6. Market and Consumer Behavior Toward Environmentally Friendly Cosmetics
      The awareness of people’s health has increased from the food to the cosmetics industry, making the market more receptive to natural cosmetics. This is evidenced by the growing use of natural materials and resources in manufacturing cosmetics, driven by the marketing appeal of these products. This trend is fueled by the ever-increasing environmental and health awareness worldwide, especially in developed countries. Producers and consumers of cosmetics are adapting to this new reality. The popularity of natural cosmetics can be attributed to the growing perception of the adverse effects of synthetic additives on health and the environment. As a result, health consciousness, ecological motivation, and environmental knowledge are essential to understanding green buying behavior [90].
      Many cosmetics contain ingredients derived from marine bioproducts. Their cosmetics use can be attributed to their skin benefits [94]. Extracts from algae moisturize, improve blood circulation, activate cell renewal and metabolism, regenerate tissues, have anti-inflammatory effects, and increase skin resistance [95,96]. In particular, the production of natural cosmetics with spirulina extract can have a significant positive impact on the cosmetic industry. Spirulina extract can replace the chemical ingredients present in most cosmetics, as it contains a wide variety of components, such as proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and natural pigments, such as chlorophyll, carotenoids, and C-phycocyanin [97,98]. Additionally, spirulina has several biological activities of interest, such as antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory activities, which add value to cosmetics production. Cosmetics with spirulina have the potential to be a promising product for the industry due to the richness of biological and chemical benefits, as well as being low-cost and environmentally friendly.
      Due to the increasing access to information about the current global environmental situation, cosmetics consumers increasingly demand product additives. As a result, manufacturers are expanding their range of natural cosmetics to take advantage of the changing consumer attitude. This is making the global industry highly competitive and raising the level of excellence of its products. The eco-friendly strategy is now critical to business sustainability, but only some companies can implement it. The lack of regulation in the current market is also a barrier to implementing natural cosmetics, increasing consumer distrust [99]. Therefore, the introduction of legal regulations should be intensified to fill this gap. In addition, new marketing strategies can attract consumers who purchase eco-friendly cosmetics and new consumers to the sector.
      For consumers of natural cosmetics, the relationship between price performance and quality are essential factors to consider. If the product does not meet the consumer’s expectations, the purchase becomes a negative experience. A study by Amberg and Fogarassy [100] analyzed the profile of Hungarian consumers regarding natural cosmetics, categorizing them into three groups: one group that prefers to buy natural cosmetics, another that prefers chemical cosmetics, and a third group that purchases both. It was found that these groups have different perceptions about the benefits of natural cosmetics, with some determining factors including price, knowledge about the cause, and brand tradition in the market, among others. In a similar study, Matić and Puh [101] analyzed the profile of Croatian consumers. They concluded that those more likely to buy organic food and care about their health are more open to using natural cosmetics. In another work, a study on the consumption of natural cosmetics in South Africa, Shimul et al. [102] emphasize that empowering consumers through education and learning is fundamental to motivating or convincing them to make eco-friendly purchases. Based on these observations, it is evident that the socioeconomic characteristics of the region, as well as access to information, are crucial factors for the maintenance and acceptance of natural products in cosmetic formulations.
      Regarding using algae as natural additives in cosmetics, Lafarga et al. [103] observed a remarkable need for more knowledge about the fundamental aspects of microalgae. This demonstrates that although microalgae are considered sustainable, nutritious, healthy, and safe additives, there is still little information on this subject. Another problem with using algae extracts is the poor exploration of these extracts as primary active ingredients. This is still a largely unexplored field in the cosmetics industry.
      To enhance the contextual understanding of spirulina’s emergence in the cosmetic industry, a historical timeline is presented in Figure 4. This timeline highlights pivotal moments in the biotechnological, regulatory, and commercial development of spirulina-based cosmetic products. Key milestones include establishing extraction techniques for phycocyanin, stabilization and delivery systems advances, landmark patents, international approvals, and the market introduction of notable cosmetic formulations. Together, these events illustrate the progressive incorporation of spirulina into modern cosmeceutical innovations and validate its growing commercial relevance.
      There is a growing trend in the use of microalgae in the cosmeceutical industry, incorporating products extracted from their biomass into cosmetic formulations. However, consumers will not choose natural cosmetic products if they are less effective than chemical ones. Additionally, basic knowledge about natural additives, environmental awareness, and a preference for natural products do not always create a positive association for consumers. As spirulina and algae, in general, are not common ingredients in the Western diet, the perception of their benefits must be clear so that products that use spirulina as an additive are better accepted and consumed.
      In line with this increasing interest in natural and algae-based cosmetics, several companies worldwide have launched commercial products incorporating spirulina as an active ingredient. These products vary in type and application, ranging from facial care and haircare to nutritional supplements with cosmetic appeal. The table below presents a selection of companies currently offering spirulina-based cosmetic products, highlighting their country of origin, product category, intended application, and purchase links. Table 2 illustrates the growing integration of spirulina into the global cosmetics market and provides practical examples that support its commercial viability and consumer appeal.
    
    
      7. Future Trends in the Application of Nanotechnology and Spirulina in Cosmetic Formulations
      Despite the biotechnological advances in the use of spirulina, significant gaps remain in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of its biomass constituents. Elucidating these mechanisms is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the biological effects attributed to its bioactive compounds and for the safe expansion of its cosmetic applications. Moreover, comprehensive studies on cutaneous toxicity and allergenic potential are critical to ensure topical formulations containing spirulina’s long-term safety and efficacy. Cutaneous permeation also stands as a key limitation, as the effectiveness of the active compounds relies on their ability to traverse the epidermal barrier [33,90].
      Integrating nanotechnology and bioactive compounds derived from spirulina represents an emerging and innovative approach to developing more effective and functional cosmetic products. These bioactive compounds can be incorporated into nanomaterials to enhance their stability, bioavailability, and controlled release, which are key features for topical and dermatological applications. Moreover, using biomass or biopolymers from spirulina to fabricate bioactive nanostructures and scaffolds offers advantages such as biocompatibility and reduced risk of rejection while maintaining their biological activity during encapsulation and release processes [88].
      Among the emerging technologies, producing nanofibers via electrospinning using natural pigments, particularly phycocyanin extracted from spirulina, has shown considerable promise. Studies have demonstrated that polymeric nanofibers containing phycocyanin exhibit high encapsulation efficiency, thermal stability, and pH-responsive behavior. These characteristics are highly relevant for designing smart delivery and protective systems for bioactive cosmetic formulations. The irreversible color change observed in phycocyanin-containing nanofibers further indicates the structural integrity and stability of the encapsulated compounds, which are highly desirable attributes in topical products exposed to environmental stressors [49,50].
      The fabrication of nanofibers incorporating natural pigments also presents significant potential in sensory and functional applications. The use of spirulina as a pigment source enabled the development of nanofibers with tunable optical and thermal properties, which may be exploited in cosmetic products as stability indicators or active sensors. Electrospinning, due to its ability to produce fibers with a high surface area-to-volume ratio and adjustable morphology, is a versatile tool for creating systems that enhance the interaction between bioactive agents and human skin [50].
      Another promising strategy involves the incorporation of spirulina in extruded starch-based matrices, which significantly influences the nano and microstructural organization of these materials. The formation of amylose-lipid complexes induced by intracellular compounds of spirulina during extrusion led to the development of foams with increased thermal stability and controlled porosity. These structural attributes can be translated into cosmetic applications, especially for formulating structured vehicles (gels or aerogels) that demand specific rheological and mechanical properties to ensure effective topical delivery of active ingredients [104,105].
      Lastly, using spirulina as a reducing agent in the green synthesis of metal nanoparticles has introduced a novel and sustainable avenue for functional material development. A recent study demonstrated the successful synthesis of cerium oxide nanoemulsions using spirulina extract, with superior antioxidant, antimicrobial, and selective cytotoxic effects compared to non-encapsulated nanoparticles. The potential application of such systems in cosmetics includes multifunctional formulations with antipollution, anti-aging, and skin-brightening properties. Nanoencapsulation further enhances these benefits, improving efficiency and environmental stability. Furthermore, the green synthesis approach aligns with current trends in sustainable chemistry and circular economy, which are increasingly valued by the contemporary cosmetic industry [105].
    
    
      8. Conclusions
      Applying spirulina in cosmetic formulations has many benefits, but much is still to be explored. Despite the great proven potential of the spirulina biomass and the C-PC pigment extracted from this cyanobacterium, few studies have evaluated its potential to produce biocosmetics, opening a series of opportunities for product development in the academic and industrial fields. Considering the survey conducted in this research, it is noteworthy that C-PC is used not only as a natural pigment but also as a promoter of several health benefits mainly related to antioxidant action. Furthermore, spirulina and its derivatives are potential natural ingredients to replace synthetic preservatives and antioxidants, which are widely associated with several harmful effects when used in the short and long term. Technological advances in micro- and nanoencapsulation have become essential tools to overcome key limitations related to spirulina-based compounds’ chemical instability and low skin permeability. These delivery systems protect sensitive bioactive compounds from degradation and enhance their bioavailability, controlled release, and penetration into deeper skin layers, significantly boosting spirulina’s effectiveness and commercial viability in modern cosmetic formulations. However, this technology can lead to an increase in the added value of the final product and, consequently, low demand due to its high cost. In this sense, marketing strategies should be employed to make natural products popular and convey their various environmental and human health benefits.

Title: Role of Nutritional Elements in Skin Homeostasis: A Review

Abstract: Skin aging is the most prominent phenotype of human aging and is the result from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Improving skin aging is essential for maintaining the normal physiological function of the skin and the mental health of the human body. Existing studies have proposed many theories of aging, such as the free radical theory, mitochondrial theory of aging, etc., and accordingly have also proposed appropriate interventions. It is worth noting that many nutrients contained in the skin itself play an important role in maintaining skin health. During the aging process, a decrease in the levels of these nutrients is closely related to a weakening of the related functions. Therefore, supplementing these nutrients offers potential therapeutic options for improving skin aging. In this review, we summarize the important roles of nutrients in the skin and their potential in anti-aging, with the expectation of providing a therapeutic basis and clinical reference for delaying skin aging.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Human skin is one of the largest organs of the body and plays many critical roles in maintaining body homeostasis, protecting the organism from external damage, maintaining body temperature and water balance, and transmitting sensory information, among other functions [1]. In order to be able to effectively fulfill these complex and important functions, the skin has developed the ability to provide a high degree of plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions while maintaining its structural integrity. It plays an important role in water and electrolyte homeostasis (epidermal barrier and sweat glands), thermoregulation (in vitro receptors), and immune response (skin-associated lymphoid tissue (SALT)). It is also an important sensory organ (with free nerve endings, Pacini vesicles, Meissner vesicles, Ruffini vesicles, Krause telomeres, and Merkel cells). It is also involved in metabolism and homeostasis in the body and is responsible for the removal, selective absorption, and storage of substances [2]. In addition, the skin is the body’s bearer of aesthetic functions, and its appearance, health, and well-being are inextricably linked to the body’s mental health [3].
      The skin functions largely rely on the composition of nutrients in the host skin ecological environment. Recently, however, growing attention has been given to the effect of nutrition on skin homeostasis, with selected food components emerging as an alternative way to improve photoaging phenotypes [4]. Food and nutrition are associated with skin homeostasis in a two-way relationship. While nutrient deficiency has a vital effect on skin status, skin homeostasis also influences nutritional intake. Moreover, unhealthy diets result in a range of skin disorders, influence all the skin’s status from youth to aging, and induce injury to the skin, while a balanced diet is not only essential for the restoration of impaired skin but also for the skin’s phenotype and homeostasis [5,6]. Thus, the goal of the review is to research the different structures of the skin and their functions, the role played by nutrients contained in the skin itself versus nutrients from outside (fruits or vegetables) in the maintenance of skin health, and several measures that are effective in improving skin aging today. The views and data were collated from a range of literature databases and resources such as ScienceDirect, PubMed, Wiley, Springer, Taylor & Francis, INFLIBNET, Scopus, Google, and Google Scholar. The keywords and corresponding Relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms used for searching databases include aging, impaired skin, nutrition, nutritious foods, balanced diet, unhealthy diet, fruits and vegetables, antioxidants, probiotics, and phytoestrogens. The selection process for relevant articles involved various titles obtained from the electronic database, then an evaluation of the abstracts of all analyzed and selected titles based on predetermined inclusion criteria.
    
    
      2. Structures of the Skin
      
        2.1. Epidermis
        The epidermis is a highly cellular structure that is free of blood vessels and provides the body with a major barrier against environmental damage [7], protecting it from pathogens, ultraviolet radiation (UVR), and environmental pollution, while regulating the release of water from the body [8]. The epidermis is a continuously renewed structure that is mainly regenerated by epidermal stem cells. Cells located in the epidermis are divided into two main types: keratin-forming cells and non-keratin-forming cells, in which stem cells from the basement membrane differentiate to form keratin-forming cells, which are the main epidermal cell type forming the superficial layer of the epidermis. These cells are enriched in waveform proteins, junctional proteins, α-endoproteins, and nestin proteins, in addition to the family of keratins, which are alternatively and abundantly expressed in the different stages of keratin-forming cell differentiation. Non-keratin-forming cells consist of three main types of cells: melanocytes, Langerhans cells, and Merkel cells. Furthermore, the epidermis itself can be divided into five layers. From the outside to the inside, they are the stratum corneum, stratum pellucidum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale.
      
      
        2.2. Dermis
        The dermis is the deeper area located below the epidermis and is the main component of the skin, providing the scaffolding and structure for the skin. The dermis is a dense and irregular layer of connective tissue, 2–3 mm thick, accounting for the majority of the skin’s thickness. It consists primarily of the fibroblast-produced extracellular matrix (ECM) that supports the skin’s vascular system, sensory nerve cells, and organelles such as sweat glands and hair follicles. Although these glands and organelles contain multiple cell populations, the dermal ECM itself consists primarily of sparsely distributed fibroblasts. These cells synthesize a complex structural matrix composed of collagen, elastin fibers, negatively charged hydrophilic proteoglycans, and hyaluronic acid. In addition to these major components, there are many less abundant ECM components, including soluble proteases, protease inhibitors, and cytokines. The dermis contains two main parts: the papillary layer and the reticular layer. The papillary dermis is the layer closest to the epidermis, directly beneath it, and has dermal papillae, while the reticular layer is located deep within the dermis and contains a large number of collagen fibers, elastic fibers, and glycosaminoglycans. Among them, hyaluronic acid has the ability to bind water and thus maintain skin moisture [9]. Fibroblasts are the most abundant cells in the dermis, and an important feature of these cells is their ability to synthesize and remodel the ECM, with remodeling supported by the synthesis of cleaved metalloproteinases and their inhibitors.
      
      
        2.3. Epidermal-Dermal Junction
        The epidermal-dermal junction is a basement membrane synthesized by basal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts and consists of a highly specialized extracellular matrix (composed of proteins such as laminin and type IV collagen) that mechanically anchors the two tissues while also playing a regulatory role in development and wound healing [10,11]. The DEJ is able to act as a mechanical support for dermal-epidermal adhesion and as a barrier to macromolecules, inflammatory cells, and tumor cells. In addition, it serves as an obligatory channel for nutrient delivery from the dermis to the epidermis, which can be accomplished to enable the penetration of nutrients and metabolic wastes, thus maintaining the overall homeostasis of the skin. Typically, in young, healthy human skin, the DEJ consists of embedded protrusions (papillae), similar to the villi of the small intestine, that maximize the surface area between the two layers, which improves the efficiency of nutrient delivery from the dermis to the epidermis [10]. On a mechanical level, this structure enhances adhesion between the dermis and epidermis and protects the dermis from physical trauma by diffusing external forces along the contact zone [12]. Furthermore, the absence of these papillae is a key marker of aging [13]. The structure of the epidermal-dermal junction is complex and consists of four different layers, namely the cytomembrane layer, the thylakoid layer, the dense layer, and the sub-dense layer region [10].
      
      
        2.4. Subcutaneous Tissue
        The subcutaneous tissue is a structure consisting of loose connective and adipose tissue located deep within the dermis [14], which connects the skin to the muscles. The subcutaneous tissue gives the skin some mobility, and the thickness of the subcutaneous tissue varies considerably depending on the individual, age, sex, nutrition, and disease; in general, it is thickest in the abdomen and buttocks and thinnest on the eyelids, dorsum of the hands, and dorsum of the feet. The subcutaneous tissue is rich in fat, which serves to cushion underlying tissues and organs from physical damage, provide insulation, and act as an energy reserve [15].
      
    
    
      3. Nutrients Contained in the Different Structures of the Skin and Their Functions
      
        3.1. Lipids
        Skin lipids are mainly produced by sebocytes, keratin-forming cells, and the skin microbiome [16] (Table 1). Cortical cell-derived lipids are synthesized by sebaceous glands and secreted to the skin surface, with squalene, triglycerides (TG), fatty acids (FA), wax esters, cholesterol (CHOL), and cholesteryl esters as the main components. Lipid precursors are synthesized by keratin-forming cells and secreted in the form of lamellipodia, which ultimately release lipid precursors and lipid synthase into the extracellular space of the stratum corneum (SC). Lipid precursors are then catalyzed by lipid synthase to produce lipids, which mainly consist of ceramides, fatty acids, and cholesterol; additionally, the skin microbiome is an important source of skin lipids, that should not be ignored [17,18,19]. The skin is colonized by a wide range of microorganisms, most of which produce skin lipids, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), during metabolic processes [20]. Lipids are important metabolites with many important cellular functions [21], including energy metabolism, signal transduction, enzyme activation, transmembrane transport, cell proliferation, development, differentiation, and apoptosis. In the classification system provided by Lipid MAPS, lipids can be categorized into eight groups, including fatty acids (FA), glycerol lipids (GL), glycerophospholipids (GP), sphingolipids (SP), sterol lipids (ST), isoprenoid lipids (PR), glycolipid lipids (GL), and polyketides (PK). Importantly, lipid composition provides a direct readout of the cellular metabolic state, and changes in lipid metabolism are important factors in the pathogenesis of respective diseases [22,23,24,25,26,27,28], such as metabolic disorders, several cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and skin diseases.
        In addition, skin condition is significantly influenced by skin lipids, and one of the earliest and widely studied aspects of skin lipid function is the maintenance of barrier function. The human skin is one of the largest organs that protects the body from irritants that affect human health, and skin lipids are among the most important compounds that maintain this barrier function; however, the influence of skin lipids on skin condition is not limited to this. They include (1) physicochemical functions, as they act as “mantle” that establishes the skin’s physicochemical barrier; (2) biochemical functions, as they signal in a complex network of signals originating at the epidermal level; and (3) microecological functions, as sebocytes and keratinocytes derive lipids that alter the composition of the microbial dermatoflora. Microbial metabolism produces lipids as signal initiators and signal transducers.
        
          3.1.1. Ceramides
          It is always known that in addition to providing structural support to cell membranes, lipids produce cellular messengers (e.g., arachidonic acid, diacylglycerol, and ceramides) [29]. Ceramides belong to the sphingolipid class of compounds, and sphingolipids are structurally based on sphingomyelin or related bases. Ceramides are poorly soluble in water, but they are usually considered amphiphilic due to the presence of hydroxyl and amide bonds, which provide hydrophilicity to them.
          Ceramides are mainly found in the epidermis, where they account for approximately 50% of the total epidermal lipid weight. Together with free fatty acids and cholesterol, ceramides constitute a hydrophilic extracellular lipid matrix, which is important for permeability barrier function [30]. In addition, ceramides act as active second messengers, regulate the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, enhance the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and modulate the immune response. Epidermal ceramides are predominantly found in the stratum corneum and exhibit great molecular specificity. Several types of ceramides have been identified in the stratum corneum [31]. Normal-phase liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry analysis revealed more than 340 ceramides in the human stratum corneum [32]. The heterogeneity of the ceramide molecular structure allows for significant differences in the functions of different classes of ceramides, suggesting that they have different roles in skin homeostasis. Ceramides, fatty acids, and cholesterol constitute the extracellular lipid matrix of the epidermal barrier in approximately equimolar ratios and are assembled in dense orthogonal lateral stacks within the SC interstitium. Of these, ceramides are central to the structure and function of the permeability barrier. In certain skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, where skin barrier function is impaired, decreased ceramide levels are commonly observed. Reduced barrier function may be due to increased activity of enzymes such as ceramidase, sphingomyelin deacetylase, and glucosylceramide deacetylase, which enhance the degradation of ceramides and thus reduces the amount of ceramide in the skin. Patients with atopic dermatitis have lower concentrations of ceramide in the stratum corneum, which may be due to the increased activity of sphingosine deacetylase, an enzyme that degrades sphingolipids and produces sphingomyelin phosphorylcholine rather than ceramide [33]. As a signaling lipid that regulates epidermal function, ceramide activates several downstream signals, including ceramide-activated serine/threonine phosphatases (CAPS) such as protein phosphatase 1A [34], protein kinase C (PKC), histone D [35], and the kinase inhibitor RAS (KSR) [36]. Activation of these proteins induces a variety of responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in the epidermis [37,38]. Among these effects, ceramide-induced apoptosis, including apoptosis and autophagy, has been extensively studied and has attracted much attention.
        
        
          3.1.2. Squalenes
          Squalene is secreted only by sebaceous glands and can be used as a marker to differentiate sebaceous gland lipids from stratum corneum lipids [39]. Squalene is an unsaturated triterpene consisting of six isoprenoids linked together, and due to its specific chemical structure, it possesses strong moisturizing and antioxidant properties. Analysis of sebaceous gland lipids by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) revealed that patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) had a twofold reduction in the amount of sebaceous gland lipids (especially squalene and wax esters) compared to healthy control subjects [40,41]. Additionally, the potential role of squalene and its peroxides in preventing sunburn and UV radiation has been reported [42]. Furthermore, waxes are more antioxidant than other lipids and may improve the water resistance of surfaces [43].
        
        
          3.1.3. Triglycerides
          Triglycerides (TGs) are the most abundant components of sebaceous gland lipids. Li et al. showed that there is a correlation between the altered composition of TGs and the subtypes of AD [44]. A group of triglyceride levels (TG46:1, TG48:1, TG48:2, TG50:1, TG50:2, and TG50:3) was significantly lower in participants with AD and was not adjusted for age and sex. In contrast, TG46:2 and TG56:2 were significantly lower in AD participants after adjustment for age and gender [44].
        
        
          3.1.4. Free Fatty Acids
          The ordered lipid accumulation in the stratum corneum is induced by free fatty acids (FFAs) with predominantly saturated chains with carbon chain lengths ranging from 12 to 30, with the majority of FFAs having chain lengths of 22, 24, or 26 carbon atoms [45,46]. Together with cholesterol sulfates, free fatty acids are the only lipids with charged/ionizable head groups in the stratum corneum [47], and thus may be necessary for the formation of the SC lipid bilayer. The presence of free fatty acids causes the SC epidermis to exhibit an acidic pH of approximately 4–5.5 [15].
        
        
          3.1.5. Cholesterol
          Cholesterol is the most abundant lipid in the whole body and is part of the stratum corneum, plasma membrane, and intercellular lipid lamellae. Although basal cells can reabsorb cholesterol from the circulation, most of the cholesterol in the epidermis is synthesized in situ from acetate [48]. It is likely that the function of cholesterol in the epidermal barrier is to provide a degree of mobility and flexibility to the rigid and fragile membrane system.

        3.2. Proteins
        The proteins in the skin are mainly composed of fibrous proteins. Fibrous proteins are primarly found in the dermis. The properties of fibers made up of different proteins vary and can be classified as follows:
        
          3.2.1. Collagen Fibers
          Collagen fibers are the main component of dermal fibers, accounting for about 95%. Collagen fibers are tough and tensile, giving the skin tension and toughness against external mechanical damage while storing large amounts of water. Collagen fibers located in the superficial plexiform papillary layer are thin and have different directions, while collagen fibers in the deep reticular layer become thicker and intertwine parallel to the skin to form a network. Of these, collagen type I is the most common collagen, which accounts for approximately 50–80% of the dry weight of the entire dermal matrix [57]. It reduces skin aging caused by UV light and is present throughout the dermis in large bundles, larger in diameter than the embryonic-derived collagen type III. Type III collagen accounts for 10–15%. In addition to this, other important collagen types in the dermis include collagen types IV, VI, and VII. Type IV collagen is connected to laminin-6 and is found mainly in the basement membrane, whereas type V collagen is ubiquitous in connective tissues (about 10% of the dry weight of the dermis), where it establishes a separate network structure in the reticulation of type I and type III collagen [58]. Type VII collagen forms anchoring fibers at the dermal-epidermal junction, and additionally, its amount is significantly reduced in aging skin exposed to prolonged ultraviolet light [59]. X Type VII, called the motile version, is present at hemibridged granules; it connects to cenadherin-5, and it is also the main ligand for the integrins α-6-β-4. Type V collagen accounts for approximately 5% of the dermal matrix [60].
        
        
          3.2.2. Elastic Fibers
          Elastin is a gelatinous protein and is the main component of elastic fibers. In addition, the elastin molecules constituting elastic fibers have the structural characteristic of curling; when subjected to external forces, the curled elastin molecules stretch and lengthen, and after removing the external forces, the elongated elastin molecules return to the curled state, as if they were springs. Therefore, elastic fibers are rich in elasticity but poor in toughness, and elastin accounts for only 2% of the total dry weight of the skin [61]. Elastic fibers are more than collagen fibers intertwined and twisted together. The direction of the papillary layer of elastic fibers is perpendicular to the epidermis so that the skin can be bounced back to its original position after being touched and pressed; the direction of the reticular layer of elastic fibers is the same as that of the collagen fibers and is parallel to the skin surface so that the collagen fibers can be restored to their original state after being pulled so that the skin has lateral elasticity and compliance, and it has a protective effect against external mechanical damage.
          Elastin fibers exist in a different state compared to collagen, which exists only in a mature state throughout the dermis. Elastin is first synthesized as a water-soluble precursor substance and then cross-linked. The maturity of elastin increases through extensive cross-linking; that is, the molecular solubility decreases and then increases, with only mature elastic fibers present deep in the dermis, whereas immature fibers are still present in the superficial dermis, i.e., the papillary layer. The mature fibers consist of an irregular core of elastin as well as surrounding microprimary fibers that are rich in elastin (90%), and the most mature elastic fibers are found at the very bottom of the dermal reticular layer. They are all closely related to the elasticity of the skin.
          Elastin is rich in glycine and proline, as is collagen, but they differ in that elastin contains only small amounts of hydroxyproline and is free of hydroxylysine [62]. Its amino acid composition is highly nonpolar. Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet light leads to the degradation of elastic fibers, and some irregularities can be clearly observed under the light microscope, a condition known as elastic tissue degeneration.
        
        
          3.2.3. Netted Fibers
          They are more naïve fibrillar collagen fibers and are found in small numbers in the dermis. Reticular fibers are usually observed as a meshwork of fine protofibrils stained black by silver impregnation, which are usually located subcutaneously and cover the surface of muscle cells, adipocytes, etc. Under the electron microscope, the reticulated fibers are observed as individual collagen fibers or as small bundles of protofibrils, which are very thin in diameter, about 30 nm, and uniformly thick or thin. In silver-impregnated specimens, individual protofibrils in the reticular fibers were densely encapsulated by coarse metal particles, possibly be due to the high content of glycoproteins surrounding the protofibrils [63].
        
        
          3.2.4. Polyfilament Proteins
          The physical barrier of the skin consists mainly of the SC, while the nucleated epidermis provides additional support. In particular, cell-cell junctions and associated cytoskeletal proteins provide other important components. Among these, keratins are arranged into highly ordered and condensed arrays through interactions with the matrix protein polyfilament proteins during the final stages of normal differentiation of keratin-forming cells. The role of polyfilament proteins in skin barrier homeostasis is only partially known. Polyfilament proteins play an important role in retaining moisture in the stratum corneum and are located in the granular keratin-forming cells and hypokeratinocytes of the stratum corneum [64]. Polyfilament proteins, together with keratin intermediates, aggregate during the terminal differentiation of the epidermis of malignant tumors and are an integral part of the envelope of the keratinized cells.
          Polyfilament proteins aggregate keratin filaments into tight bundles, which promotes cell collapse into the flattened shape that characterizes keratinocytes in the keratinized layer [65]. Together, keratin and polyfilament proteins account for 80–90% of the protein mass of mammalian epidermis [66,67]. The importance of polyfilament proteins to epidermal barrier homeostasis has been shown in mouse models and human diseases, where this protein is aberrantly expressed in patients with common ichthyosis and atopic dermatitis [65,68,69]. Overexpression of filament polyprotein on mouse basal epidermis results in delayed barrier repair [70].
        
        
          3.2.5. Keratins
          Keratins are the major structural proteins synthesized in keratin-forming cells; they assemble into a reticular pattern of intermediate filaments that extend from the perinuclear ring throughout the cytoplasm and terminate at the bridging and hemibridging granules. In keratin disorders, the network of filaments around the nucleus collapses, and thus interactions between neighboring cells are altered. In humans, genetic defects in suprabasal keratins result in hyperkeratosis and mild barrier defects manifested by a fragile and easily damaged epidermis. Keratin fundamentally affects epithelial cell structure (e.g., cell polarity and cell shape) and mitotic activity. The primary function of keratin and keratin filaments is to provide scaffolding for epithelial cells and tissues to maintain mechanical stress, preserve their structural integrity, and ensure mechanical elasticity [71].
        
      
      
        3.3. Amino Acids
        Each hundred grams of dried human skin tissue contains 71.9% collagen and 0.9% elastin. Skin collagen consists of glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, lysine, and hydroxylysine; elastin consists of glycine, alanine, valine, proline, and hydroxyproline. The properties and functions of each amino acid are described below in turn.
        
          3.3.1. Glycines (Gly)
          Glycine is a major component of skin collagen, accounting for 1/3 of the amino acids in collagen and elastin and plays an important role in nutrition and metabolism. Glycine can be synthesized in the body and is a non-essential amino acid. However, increasing evidence suggests that the amount of glycine synthesized in vivo is insufficient to meet the metabolic needs of animals (including the synthesis of collagen, glutathione, and hemoglobin) [72]. Glycine has a facilitating effect on epidermal cell wandering and facilitates wound healing. Elastin fibers are essential extracellular matrix components of the skin that help maintain skin elasticity. During skin aging, elastin synthesis decreases, and activity is reduced, leading to skin laxity and loss of elasticity. Glycine induces the activation of elastin promoter activity and inhibits the degradation of elastin fibers by elastase in vitro [73].
        
        
          3.3.2. Prolines (Pro)
          Proline, along with glycine, is the main amino acid involved in collagen synthesis, accounting for approximately 15% of the amino acid composition of collagen. It can be converted to hydroxylysine and hydroxyproline in the body to aid in the formation of collagen [74], Proline is beneficial for skin health and wound healing, stimulating cell migration and contributing to new tissue development, with blood proline levels near wounds being at least 50% higher than plasma levels during the early stages of wound healing [75]. Collagen supplements containing proline can improve skin barrier function, induce hyaluronic acid synthesis, and promote fibroblast growth and migration. In addition to its anti-aging and restorative effects, other functions of proline include support of the immune system, improvement of antioxidant status, improvement of intestinal health and nutrient absorption in the body, support of the metabolism, protection of the cardiovascular system, and participation in the skin’s metabolism, which is important for the overall health of the skin [76].
        
        
          3.3.3. Hydroxyprolines (Hpro)
          Hydroxyproline is the main component of collagen, accounting for 14% of the total amino and imino content of collagen. Unlike glycine and proline, hydroxyproline is produced from proline-containing collagen. Specifically, hydroxyproline residues are formed by post-translational hydroxylation of proline in newly synthesized collagen [77]. Hydroxyproline is a structurally and physiologically important sub-amino acid in animals, which can be converted to glycine, enhancing the production of glutathione, DNA, hemoglobin, and proteins [78]. It has been shown that hydroxyproline can upregulate collagen biosynthesis and degradation, activate the collagen turnover cycle, and stimulate collagen metabolism [79].
        
        
          3.3.4. Lysines (Lys)
          Lysine is one of the essential amino acids that can promote human development, enhance immune function, improve central nervous system function, act as an antiviral, promote fat oxidation, relieve anxiety, and more. At the same time, it can also promote the absorption of certain nutrients and can synergize with some nutrients to better facilitate the physiological functions of various nutrients. The recommended daily intake of lysine is 41 mg/kg body weight for adults and 89 mg/kg body weight for children. Lysine is involved in the synthesis of many proteins, such as skeletal muscle, enzymes, serum proteins, and peptide hormones. It is particularly important for the normal function of collagen and elastin. Lysine is not only found in the dermis, but some studies have found lysine in the epidermis as well [80]. Lysine plays an important role in the synthesis of fibronectin, collagen, and elastin [81].
        
        
          3.3.5. Cystines
          Cystine is found in keratin in nails and hair and can be synthesized artificially, Cystine is a stable dimer consisting of two cysteine molecules linked by a disulfide bond and is obtained by food and food supplements. Purified cystine is 100% usable as a food supplement and is rapidly absorbed by the body and provides cells with enough cysteine for glutathione production [82]. Cystine assists in skin formation and is important for detoxification, protecting cells from copper toxicity by reducing the body’s ability to absorb copper. When metabolized, it releases sulfuric acid, which chemically interacts with other substances to increase the detoxification function of the entire metabolic system. In addition, it aids in the supply of insulin, which is necessary for the body to utilize sugar and starch. It also promotes cellular redox, enables vigorous liver function, promotes leukocyte proliferation, and prevents the development of pathogenic bacteria. It is used for hepatitis, alopecia areata, and leukopenia.
        
        
          3.3.6. Mercaptoethyl Amine
          Cysteine is typically the limiting amino acid synthesized from glutathione, and increasing the supply of cysteine or its precursors enhances glutathione synthesis. Moreover, the main source of cysteine at the cellular level is cystine. While glutathione is a tripeptide composed of cysteine, glycine, and glutamic acid. It is a powerful intracellular antioxidant, and its antimelanogenic activity has been demonstrated [83,84,85].
        
        
          3.3.7. Arginines (Arg)
          Arginine can be formed as an intermediate in the urea cycle in the mammalian liver, but there is no net synthesis of arginine in the liver [86]. There are no reports on the cutaneous urea cycle, and in humans, arginine is synthesized from glutamine, glutamate, and proline via the long renal axis. Arginine is a conditionally essential amino acid for children and adults [87]. It has the ability to repair damaged skin [88].
        
      
      
        3.4. Vitamins
        
          3.4.1. Vitamin C
          Normal skin contains high levels of vitamin C, comparable to other body tissues and much higher than plasma concentrations, indicating active circulatory accumulation, and most of the vitamin C in the skin is located in intracellular compartments at concentrations in the millimolar range [89,90]. It is transported from blood vessels in the dermis into the cells. Several reports have shown low levels of vitamin C in aging or photodamaged skin, and it has also been reported that overexposure to oxidative stress through pollutants or UV radiation is associated with the depletion of vitamin C levels in the epidermis [91,92]. In fact, there is more vitamin C in the epidermis than in the dermis, with a 2- to 5-fold difference between the two layers [90]. Levels of vitamin C in the skin are similar to those of other water-soluble antioxidants such as glutathione [90,92]. There are indications that vitamin C is present in the epidermal stratum corneum in a concentration gradient [93]. Vitamin C concentrations are lowest on the outer surface of the epidermis and increase dramatically in the deeper layers of the stratum corneum, reflecting exocytotic cellular depletion due to prolonged exposure to the environment [93].
          Vitamin C is a cofactor for proline and lysine hydroxylases, stabilizes the tertiary structure of collagen molecules, and also promotes collagen gene expression [94,95], which protects against skin oxidation, contributes to the fight against skin aging, and plays a role in signaling pathways that play a role in cell growth and differentiation. Additionally. In vitro studies have shown that vitamin C can play a role in the differentiation of keratinocytes [96]. It promotes the synthesis of barrier lipids during differentiation and increases the formation of the keratinized envelope. There is evidence that vitamin C increases the proliferation and migration of dermal fibroblasts [97,98], functions that are essential for wound healing. Vitamin C deficiency can lead to significant skin problems; for example, early signs of scurvy include fragile skin and poor wound healing [99,100]. In contrast, signs of aging in human skin can be improved by providing vitamin C, which is supported by many studies [94,101].
        
        
          3.4.2. Vitamins D
          Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that is not only a nutrient required for bone health but also an essential nutrient needed to regulate many physiological functions [102]. Vitamin D can be obtained from the diet or its cholesterol precursor in the skin through the effects of UV exposure. This biologically active form requires two subsequent hydroxylation reactions to obtain active hormonal activity. Vitamin D can also be synthesized in the skin, starting with the fact that the rate of vitamin D synthesis in the granular layer is regulated by the dual processes of pigmentation and keratinization of the overlying stratum corneum, which allow only a defined amount of solar UV irradiation to penetrate the outer layers of the skin and reach the areas where vitamin D is synthesized.
        
        
          3.4.3. Vitamins B
          Thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), niacin (vitamin B3), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and biotin (vitamin B7) are water-soluble vitamins that are essential for normal cellular metabolism and red blood cell synthesis [103,104,105]. These vitamins are stored in small quantities but play a role in the skin that cannot be replaced by other vitamins. The properties of the different B vitamins are described separately below.
          
            Vitamin B3
            Niacin (vitamin B3) is a water-soluble B vitamin that has a variety of physiological functions. It acts as a hydrogen electron donor and acceptor and is essential for adenosine triphosphate production, macronutrient metabolism, DNA repair, and cell signaling. Niacin deficiency can lead to dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia, and the initial stages of deficiency are usually characterized by nonspecific symptoms such as lethargy, weakness, loss of appetite, mild digestive disturbances, and mental or emotional distress [106].
          
          
            Vitamin B6
            Vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxine, is a multifunctional coenzyme involved in many biochemical reactions, including amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid metabolism. It is also effective in cognitive development for neurotransmitter synthesis, immune function for interleukin-2 production, hemoglobin formation, and gene expression [107].
          
          
            Vitamin B7
            Vitamin B7, also known as biotin, is an essential cofactor for mammalian carboxylase enzymes, which are involved in important metabolic pathways in humans. Biotin deficiency is rare in humans, but its deficiency leads to neuromuscular dysfunction, alopecia, and dermatitis in humans [108]. Additionally, despite the fact that there is no conclusive evidence to support that biotin can be used to treat skin disorders, many physicians frequently recommend biotin for the treatment of skin disorders, with 66% of dermatologists reporting that they recommend dietary supplements to their patients to improve their skin, hair, and nails [109].
          
          
            Vitamin B12
            Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin that is important in hematology and the nervous system, and it has a complex relationship with the skin. Altered levels of cobalamin can lead to disease. The biosynthesis and metabolism of cobalamin are complex, and disease may be associated with alterations in this metabolic pathway. Skin manifestations of cobalamin deficiency include hyperpigmentation, changes in hair and nails, and changes in the oral cavity, including glossitis. In addition, several skin disorders, including vitiligo, stomatitis, atopic dermatitis, and acne, have been associated with cobalamin excess or deficiency [110,111].
          
        
        
          3.4.4. Vitamin E
          Vitamin E is a group of lipophilic compounds comprising 76 meso2tocopherols (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocopherols) and 77 tocotrienols (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-tocotrienols) [112,113]. Vitamin E is synthesized exclusively by plants [113], and all forms are supplied to the body through food. α-Tocopherol is the most important form, as it shows an affinity for a specific protein, α-TTP, which binds and transports only this form of the vitamin, while the rest of the dietary forms are metabolized in the liver and excreted in the bile [114,115].
          Vitamin E plays an important role in maintaining skin health by contributing to the skin’s antioxidant defenses and protecting the epidermis and dermis from oxidative stress induced by environmental factors. Vitamin E is the major fat-soluble antioxidant in humans [116]. Due to the antioxidant properties of vitamin E and its ability to scavenge free radicals and become part of the lipid structure, it prevents lipid peroxidation and slows down skin aging [115]. α tocopherol has been shown to reduce the amount of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine indirectly produced by reactive oxygen species, so it reduces the amount of ROS-induced DNA damage, thus helping to slow down the development of skin cancer. Several studies have also shown that vitamin E has strong photoprotective, firming, moisturizing, and anti-aging properties and improves the elasticity, structure, and suppleness of the epidermis and dermis. It is believed that vitamin E bound to intercellular and lipid structures protects the skin from solar UVB radiation, thereby preventing redness and swelling [116,117].
        
      
      
        3.5. Minerals
        Minerals, along with vitamins, are essential trace elements that cannot be synthesized by the body and therefore must be obtained through food. A healthy diet should ensure adequate intake of macronutrients (calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and magnesium) and trace minerals (iodine, sulfur, zinc, iron, cobalt, copper, manganese, and selenium). Minerals are responsible for the functions of the skeletal, circulatory, nervous, and endocrine systems. They also have many health benefits as cofactors and coenzymes in various enzyme systems and help regulate and harmonize biochemical and physiological functions. Micronutrient deficiencies can adversely affect human development and health, including the function and appearance of the skin [118]. In the context of skin aging, we also need to focus on the roles of minerals such as selenium, zinc, copper, and silicon (Figure 1).
      
    
    
      4. Nutrients Contained in Fruits and Vegetables and Their Functions
      As part of the daily diet, fruits and vegetables play a vital role in human health. They are rich in polyphenols, polysaccharides, dietary fiber, vitamins, minerals, natural pigments, and other active ingredients with antioxidant properties that protect the skin from free radical-induced cellular damage, maintain skin radiance, and prevent acne, pigmentation, and fine lines [119]. Consumption of fruits and vegetables also helps to reduce inflammation, brighten skin tone, and even lighten discoloration. Thus, bioactive compounds from a variety of plants are increasingly being used not only for body care, but also as ingredients that provide nutrients and influence the biological functions of the skin [120]. For example, polysaccharides are one of the most important active constituents in fruits and vegetables, with a large number of functional groups, high bioavailability, no toxic side effects, structural stability not easy to be denatured due to temperature and pH changes, as well as extraordinary bioactivities such as anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticancer, digestive aid, immune modulation, anti-fatigue, lipid-lowering, and glucose-lowering [119]. The seeds of various fruits are also a source of oils, extracts, powders (flours), and a wide range of beneficial bioactive compounds [121]. Increased intake of green leafy vegetables and yellow vegetables was significantly associated with reduced wrinkles [122]. The Mediterranean diet, which is mainly characterized by a high intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, and whole grains, is one of the most widely evaluated and described dietary patterns in the literature with proven health benefits [123]. The unique balanced composition of unsaturated fatty acids and vitamins in sea buckthorn oil has made it a popular ingredient in cosmetic and biomedical products, as it imparts a healthy and beautiful appearance to the skin and helps in caring for dry, rapidly aging skin, wounds, skin pigmentation, and infections [124].
      
        4.1. Healthy Fats
        Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are usually considered essential because humans cannot synthesize them on their own. Therefore, these fatty acids are obtained through various biochemical reactions in the diet [125]. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids significantly contribute to the production and circulating levels of specific anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators i.e., autoreactive substances, including the D-series of antispasmodulins, protectins, and maresins derived from docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3), as well as the D-series from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 n-3), an E-series antispasmodic [126]. Common plant sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids are vegetable oils such as corn oil, canola oil, flaxseed oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, and walnuts. DHA and EPA are omega-3 fatty acids found in fish and shellfish, whereas common plant sources of monounsaturated fatty acids are canola oil, safflower oil high in oleic acid, olive oil, sunflower oil, and nuts [127].
        Omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are essential for maintaining of cellular function and are important components of cellular phospholipid membranes. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and their metabolites also confer a variety of biological properties in the body, such as influencing neuronal function and reducing systemic inflammation. The commonly recommended optimal dietary ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is 4 to 1, while higher ratios have been associated with autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases [128]. Anti-inflammatory PUFA-based supplementation and balanced nutrition are not only critical for maintaining and improving overall skin health, but also for the management of various skin disorders [129].
      
      
        4.2. Carotenoids
        Carotenoids are mainly tetraterpenoid compounds synthesized by plants, algae, fungi, and bacteria, with lipophilic pigments that are important for the diet, with greater variation and concentration of plant carotenoids. Fruits and vegetables rich in carotenoids have mainly antioxidant properties that help fight the incidence of certain diseases. The most common carotenoids that act in a dose- and time-dependent manner include α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, saffronin, curcumin, lycopene, lutein, and zeaxanthin [130]. α-carotene, β-carotene, and β-cryptoxanthin are known as vitamin A precursor carotenoids because they can be converted to retinol, whereas lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin are non-provitamin A precursor carotenoids with no vitamin A activity. However, β-carotene is the main and readily available carotenoid in the human diet and is found mainly in dark green, red, purple, yellow and orange fruits and vegetables, such as apricots, carrots, mangoes, papaya, spinach, pumpkin and sweet potatoes [131,132]. Immunomodulatory vitamin A plays an important role in the regulation, proliferation, and differentiation of a wide range of cells, including skin cells such as fibroblasts and keratin-forming cells, thereby stimulating the synthesis of collagen and elastin by fibroblasts, smoothing out deep wrinkles, and reversing photoaging [133]. Some of the roles of carotenoids include antioxidant, immune enhancement, inhibition of precancerous lesions, inhibition of mutation and transformation, quenching of non-photochemical fluorescence, reduction of the risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular events, and decreasing the risk of cataracts and macular degeneration by acting as pigments in the macula of primates [131].
      
    
    
      5. Intervention of Different Nutrients in Skin Aging
      
        5.1. Mechanisms of Skin Aging
        Since birth, human beings are inevitably aging, and skin aging is a multifactorial process that can be categorized into endogenous aging (DNA damage, telomere shortening, mitochondrial impairment, etc.) and exogenous aging (ultraviolet rays, air pollution, smoking, etc.) according to the triggers. The former triggers aging mainly in non-sun-exposed areas of the skin, including the inner sides of the arms and buttocks, while the latter is mainly in skin that is frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face. Intrinsically aged skin appears thin on the outside and exhibits fine wrinkles, reduced elasticity, and marked dryness, often accompanied by itching. In contrast to these observations is extrinsically photoaged skin with epidermal thickening, dullness, and roughness. Capillary dilatation and pigment discoloration may also be observed in advanced and severe degrees of photoaging, which are the main skin aging-related changes found in Asian populations [134,135,136]. Skin aging is not only detrimental to physical health but also causes social impairment and can predispose to associated diseases, such as a significant increase in the incidence of dryness, itching, and skin irritation in older adults [137], alongside an increased risk of infections, chronic wounds (e.g., venous, pressure, or diabetic foot ulcers), as well as various types of dermatitis and malignant neoplasms (including melanoma) [138,139].
        The aging process affects all skin layers and manifests itself in structural and functional changes [138]. The aged epidermis exhibits reduced barrier function and recovery after injury [140]. In addition, with age, the proliferative capacity of basal layer cells decreases, epidermal thickness decreases, and the contact surface area between the dermis and epidermis decreases, resulting in a smaller exchange surface for epidermal nutrient supply and a further diminution in the proliferative capacity of basal layer cells [141,142]. In addition to changes in the epidermis, the epidermal-dermal junction flattens, and the dermis thins. The flattening of the epidermal-dermal junction results in fewer cells, less nutrients, and reduced oxygen, leading to wrinkle formation. The dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) also exhibits structural and functional changes in intrinsically and extrinsically aged skin. These include changes in the accumulation of labile collagen and type III collagen, changes in the ratio of type I/III collagen [143], impaired synthesis of these ECM molecules [144], and changes in elastic fiber organization [145]. One study found that as the COLI/COLIII ratio increases, protofiber width and stiffness increase, while the affinity for cell-matrix binding decreases. Mixed matrices had the best activation of fibroblasts, with high cell polarization, production of rigid fiber bundles, high α-SMA expression, and higher levels of collagen synthesis. It is evident that the proportion of COLI and COLIII in the matrix is important, and together they determine the nature of the matrix and direct different cell biological responses [146]. Decrease in the number of fibroblasts also leads to alterations and degradation of the ECM, which is manifested by thinning of the skin, increased wrinkles, and loss of elasticity [147]. Aging also leads to anatomical changes affecting the skin’s microcirculation loop [112], which is characterized by a decrease in the size and number of blood vessels, associated with defective angiogenesis. The loss of dermal nutrient vascular density and exchange surface is accompanied by disorganization of the vascular network [148], which may also reveal changes in certain physiological features of aging skin, including pallor, decreased skin temperature, decreased UV-induced erythema, decreased nutrient intake, and decreased skin vascular reactivity [149]. These histologic changes are ultimately manifested as an overall thinning of the skin and diminished adipomuscular support, leading to skin laxity and increased wrinkles.
        There are many mechanisms of skin aging, and researchers have proposed different models to explain the molecular basis of skin aging, including the theory of cellular senescence, the decline in cellular DNA repair and telomere loss, extranuclear mitochondrial DNA point mutations, oxidative stress, increased frequency of chromosomal anomalies, single-gene mutations, chronic inflammation, and others [13]. Some scientists have proposed that most of the effects are due to extrinsic factors and only 3% of aging is caused by intrinsic factors [102]. This paper focuses on the doctrine related to oxidative stress and telomere shortening.
        It is believed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a key role in the dermal extracellular matrix alterations that are intrinsic to aging and photoaging. ROS can be produced by different sources, including the mitochondrial electron transport chain, peroxisomes, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization proteins, as well as enzymes such as cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, xanthine oxidases, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases [101]. Under common conditions in the absence of ligands, cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activity is inhibited by the receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase RPTP, which dephosphorylates RTK. However, under UV radiation, cellular chromophores absorb energy and are excited to produce oxidation products and ROS. ROS inhibit RPTP activity by binding to cysteine at the catalytic site of RPTP [150], increasing the level of phosphorylated RTK and triggering downstream signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and subsequent nuclear factor-κB (NK-κB) and activation of transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). Activated NF-κB and AP-1 inhibit collagen production and increase MMP gene transcription, leading to a decrease in collagen content in photoaged skin [151]. Notably, NF-κB has recently been found to be activated by the mammalian rapamycin complex 2/Akt/IκB kinase α pathway in aging and photoaging [152].
        Telomere shortening is one of the earliest and most characteristic mechanisms that induce cellular senescence. Telomeres are located at the ends of linear chromosomes and consist of thousands of bases that contain tandemly repeated DNA sequences. Telomeres maintain the stability of chromosome structure by protecting chromosomes from degradation by nucleases and preventing end linkage between chromosomes [153]. When these telomeres remain intact, the life cycle of the cell is prolonged. However, with each cell division, the telomeres at the ends of the chromosomes are lost by about 30–200 base pairs (bp), and after multiple cell divisions the telomeres become very short, resulting in the loss of important DNA fragments during subsequent divisions, leading to loss of cellular function. The cell enters a state of value-added senescence, resulting in telomere loops or T-loops (TLoop) breaks and exposure of the 3′ end single-stranded overhangs. This exposure activates the tumor suppressor protein p53 and other DNA damage response proteins through interaction with the Werner protein, thereby inducing value-added cellular senescence or apoptosis, ultimately contributing to the onset of skin aging. It has also been noted that telomere loops can also naturally undergo disruption due to UV irradiation or other DNA damage [154].
        Telomeres in skin cells may be particularly susceptible to accelerated shortening due to proliferation and the DNA-damaging agent ROS. Accelerated telomere loss after oxidative stress may be mediated by intracellular DNA repair processes, DNA damage accelerates telomere shortening in the skin, and telomeres also mediate melanin formation in senescent skin [155]. Keratin-forming cells are more susceptible to apoptosis and senescence than fibroblasts as a result of DNA damage induced by UV and ionizing radiation [4]. When keratinocytes are removed as apoptotic cells due to telomere shortening and DNA damage, fibroblasts may become senescent, affecting the epidermal growth process in the form of paracrine secretion and extracellular matrix deposition in the dermis.
        Current anti-aging measures consist mainly of limiting the effects of senescence, particularly at the dermal and epidermal levels, and these approaches are diverse and involve a variety of strategies, including antioxidants, stem cell therapy, vitamin A-like acids, hormone replacement therapy, telomere modification, and dietary restrictions.
      
      
        5.2. Antioxidants
        Antioxidants act as reducing agents that can mitigate skin aging by neutralizing already formed ROS. ROS activates the MAPK pathway and subsequently increases MMP production, which degrades collagen. This can be prevented by antioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin E or antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and coenzyme Q10 [156,157]. Some plants can also be used as natural sources of antioxidants, such as green tea and aloe vera [158]. It has been shown that a catechin (EGCG) in green tea prevents skin aging through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway in a mouse model of aging, resulting in better skin structure than controls [159,160]. In addition, N-acetylcysteine, a form of the antioxidant glutathione, is capable of treating vascular and non-vascular neurological disorders as well as counteracting the age-related decline in tissue regeneration [161], which suggests its promising anti-aging applications in the skin.
        However, it is worth noting that some researchers have suggested that antioxidant supplements have no preventive effect on chronic diseases and that excessive supplementation with β-carotene and vitamins A and E may be harmful and produce unwanted side effects [162,163]. Especially in well-nourished populations, the nearest source of antioxidants comes from our diet rather than from antioxidant supplements in pills or tablets [164], and a previous study found that EGCG induced significant death and DNA damage in normal cells of human lungs and skin through a reducing mechanism [165]. The aim of antioxidant therapy is to restore oxygen homeostasis rather than to completely eliminate all oxidants, as they have physiological functions [166]. Therefore, for the necessary clinical application of antioxidants, physicians should assess the patient’s status before prescribing them; complete inactivation of all ROS is not desirable, and antioxidant therapy appears to be beneficial in aging, including skin aging, only when ROS levels are reduced to those of healthy cells.
      
      
        5.3. Stem Cell Therapy
        Stem cell transplantation is a promising therapy for treating skin aging, and adipose tissue grafting improves the quality of skin at the subject site in addition to increasing skin volume [167]. Further experiments have shown that adipose-derived stem cells (ADSC) contribute to skin regeneration during aging [168,169]. In recent clinical trials, autologous fat grafting rejuvenated aging skin and increased periocular and perioral skin volume in subjects with an average age of 50 years [170,171]. The data show that ADSCs produce a range of growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, TGF-β2, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), platelet-derived growth factor AA (PDGF-AA), and placental growth factor (PGF) [172]. ADSCs may affect the surrounding skin cells through these secretions, which reveals the mechanism by which fat grafting rejuvenates the overlying skin.
      
      
        5.4. Retinoids
        Vitamin A analogs, including retinol, retinaldehyde, retinoic acid, and synthetic analogs (tazarotene, etc.). Vitamin A analogs are chemically similar to vitamin A, including retinoids, etc. Retinoids are the first retinoids approved for clinical use, and the topical application of retinoids inhibits AP-1, which inhibits MMP expression and prevents collagen degradation [173]. Increases in epidermal thickness and anchoring protofibers observed, and intrinsically aged skin may also benefit from topical application of vitamin A analogs [174]. Additionally, 0.02% retinoic acid cream is now FDA-approved for the treatment of photoaging. Griffiths and colleagues reported a 48-week controlled trial comparing the clinical efficacy and tolerability of 0.025% and 0.1% retinoic acid creams. Both 0.025% and 0.1% retinoic acid significantly improved photoaging compared to control but there was no significant difference between the two concentrations of retinoic acid. However, 0.025% retinoic acid had fewer side effects. Moreover, Kligman conducted a 9 month experiment in which a 0.025% retinoic acid cream was applied once a day to the skin of the inner thighs of 6 women (average age 74). The results of the experiment demonstrated a significant improvement in skin condition, so that retinoic acid can combat natural aging in addition to photoaging. For significant skin improvement, retinoic acid was used for at least 6 months. No significant changes in dermal papillae were observed in the retinoic acid-treated group (whites) at 6 months, and new collagen formation was observed after 12 months. However, the experimental sample is small, and further validation is awaited.
      
      
        5.5. Hormone Replacement Therapy
        Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a medical treatment method that is often used for hormone replacement when specific hormones are missing from a patient’s body. This method involves: replacing the missing hormone with an agent containing the missing hormone that is injected into the patient’s body through an IV. In addition to being used to treat symptoms caused by menopause, HRT is also used to slows down the aging process of the skin; it improves skin thickness, collagen content and elasticity, and enhances hydration. However, some studies have shown that HRT increases the risk of breast cancer [175].
        Skin aging is accelerated during menopause; however, many women and healthcare professionals are insufficiently informed on the impact of menopause on skin [176]. Declining estrogen detrimentally affects the skin’s ECM, which provides strength, elasticity, and resilience [177]. The relationship between dermal structural changes and altered skin function has been demonstrated by measuring the biomechanical properties of young, aged, and photoaged skin in parallel with histological analyses [178]. Estrogen levels also influence skin hydration, vascularity, and pigmentation [179], and women report a greater incidence of skin dryness and sensitivity in relation to the menstrual cycle and menopause [180,181]. However, the specific biological mechanisms underlying these observations are poorly understood, as are the respective contributions of epidermal and dermal changes to skin biomechanics. This indicates that epidermal lipid synthesis is altered postmenopause and is susceptible to regulation by HRT. In summary, increased viscoelastic skin distension post-menopause is reversible by HRT and may result from altered epidermal homeostasis and dermal morphology. Smaller R6 values are associated with improved skin condition, which is evident where decreased R6 is measured following the application of anti-aging skin care routines. Skewed CD44 expression and ceramide synthesis may contribute to declining epidermal barrier function and could represent key targets, beyond ECM rejuvenation, for improving skin function and appearance in midlife.
      
      
        5.6. Telomere Modification
        Cutaneous aging represents a multifaceted biological phenomenon that is influenced by an interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices [182]. The length and integrity of telomeres exert a significant impact on the skin aging process, constituting one of the numerous influential factors [183], which has emerged as a prominent subject in the realm of anti-aging research and skin health. Although telomerase activation appears to be ideal for reversing skin aging, it is true that high levels of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression in skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes lead to a significant enhancement of proliferative capacity [184] but at the same time an increased risk of epidermal carcinogenesis [185]. Therefore, further studies are needed to assess the safety of telomere lengthening.
        Telomeres are specialized structures located at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, composed of repetitive DNA sequences that serve to safeguard against chromosomal injury and fusion [186]. Yet as cells undergo successive divisions, telomeres gradually shorten until they reach a critical length, thereby causing cell cycle arrest referred to as replicative senescence [187]. Telomere shortening is widely regarded as a priority indicator of cellular aging and closely related to the onset and progression of many age-related disorders. Recently, an increasing body of evidence has suggested a direct connection between telomere dynamics and skin aging, indicating that telomere length could be regarded as a valuable predictor for the process of skin aging and evaluation of anti-aging interventions [188,189]. The latest data advancements have suggested that telomere shortening is intricately associated not only with the conventional cellular aging process but also with biological pathways such as epigenetics, cell metabolism, and inflammatory response. For instance, it has been discovered that telomere shortening can impact gene expression patterns, thereby regulating cellular metabolism and inflammatory pathways [190], these alterations exert a vital effect on the process of skin aging. In addition, telomerase, an enzyme renowned for its ability to elongate telomeres, has garnered significant attention due to its regulation of activity and gene expression in retarding skin aging [191].
      
      
        5.7. Dietary Interventions
        Since it is still not technically feasible to reverse glycated proteins to their original state, the main strategy at present remains on the prevention of protein glycosylation. The problem, however, is that the diet provides not only sugars such as glucose and fructose, but also pre-formed angiogenic growth factors (AGFs), the latter of which are high in grilled, fried, and baked foods, but very low in foods prepared by water-based cooking such as poaching and steaming [192]. Thus, low-glycemic foods prepared with water reduce the intake of pre-formed exogenous AGFs and the endogenous production of physiologically glycated proteins. In the future, the search for drugs with deglycosylation ability will be a breakthrough discovery.
        Some scientists believe that certain culinary herbs and spices, such as cinnamon, cloves, and oregano, inhibit fructose-induced glycosylation [193], and a number of compounds, including ginger, inositol, α-lipoic acid, carnitine, taurine, carnosine, flavonoids (e.g., green tea catechins), ammonium benzyl phosphate, α-tocopherol, niacinamide, pyridoxal, sodium selenite, riboflavin, zinc, and manganese, are also involved in inhibiting AGE formation [194,195]. More studies are needed to further validate these findings and reveal their inhibitory mechanisms.
        In contrast, it is widely recognized that the nutritional status of macronutrients and micronutrients is important for skin health and appearance. Skin aging can be more effectively mitigated by supplementing nutrients that the skin synthesizes itself. Evidence for this is provided by the many vitamin-deficiency disorders that lead to serious skin diseases [196]. For example, dermatologic signs of B vitamin deficiency include blotchy red rashes, seborrheic dermatitis, and fungal skin and nail infections. Vitamin C deficiency scurvy is characterized by fragile skin, bleeding gums, and impaired wound healing [197,198].
      
      
        5.8. Nutritional Interventions in Skin Aging
        Nutritional status is critical for maintaining normal skin function during collagen synthesis and keratinocyte differentiation [118]. In addition, many of the body’s antioxidant components, such as vitamins C and E and selenium, are obtained from the diet, and these components are important for protection against UV-induced damage [199,200,201].
        The epidermis, on the other hand, is a challenging environment for nutrient delivery because of its lack of vasculature to deliver nutrients to cells. Epidermal nutrient delivery depends on diffusion from the vascularized dermis [202]. Whereas diffusion of nutrients into the outermost layers of the epidermis is limited, in addition, there is also little movement of extracellular fluid between cells due to the complex lipid/protein cross-linking structure that forms the skin barrier, all of which makes it difficult for nutrients to reach the cells in the outermost layers of the epidermis, resulting in these cells to receive little nutritional support.
        The skin can target nutrient delivery by topical application. However, because the stratum corneum acts as a barrier that prevents the passage of many substances, it is unlikely that nutrients delivered by topical application will readily penetrate deeper into the dermis, although some uncharged, lipid-soluble molecules can pass through the surface layer. Therefore, the function of the dermis is best supported by nutrients delivered through the bloodstream [203].
        Many researchers have also emphasized the relationship between a properly balanced diet and the condition of the body, including the appearance and function of the skin [204]. The intake of essential nutrients in the daily diet is extremely important for the biological processes in young and aging skin [205]. Skin is a tissue with high proliferative potential, which explains why adequate intake of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats that contribute to cell production is so important [205,206,207]. The overall condition of the skin—including surface texture, color, and physiological properties—is a result of factors such as hydration, i.e., the presence of sufficient water in the stratum corneum, sebum content, and surface acidity. Natural moisturizing factors (NMFs), composed mainly of amino acids, play an important role in hydration and acidity [208]. Specific fatty acids are also important for maintaining the function of the skin barrier and the integrity of the stratum corneum [209]. A growing body of research suggests that a well-balanced diet significantly influences the skin aging process. Functional anti-aging components in foods include substances involved in the synthesis and metabolism of skin components (e.g., protein peptides and essential fatty acids), as well as substances that inhibit the degradation of skin components and maintain their structural integrity (e.g., substances that regulate the expression of enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and activated protein 1 (AP-1)) [205]. Due to their antimutagenic, antioxidant, and free radical-scavenging properties, which protect the skin from UV-induced deleterious effects, a number of dietary plants may be useful supplements for skin care [210,211]. These include carotenoids and polyphenols such as quercetin, curcumin, apigenin, proanthocyanidins, and resveratrol. Other key elements of an anti-aging diet are vitamins and minerals with antioxidant properties [212].
        Substances that protect the skin from oxidative and UV damage, dehydration, and loss of elasticity include vitamins A, C, and E; selenium, zinc, copper, silica, and polyphenols; carotenoids; and essential polyunsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. A growing body of research suggests that a well-balanced diet significantly affects the skin aging process. These substances protect and restore the epidermal barrier, ensure proper levels of skin hydration, and protect against damage caused by external factors and inflammation. All of these nutrients have an intervening effect on skin aging (Figure 2).
      
    
    
      6. Pharmaceutical or Cosmetic Topical in Skin Aging
      Various offerings of plant origin have been observed as anti-aging offerings regulating one or more mediators associated with skin elasticity and wrinkle production. Over the past few years, potential anti-aging isolated compounds from plants were reported to increase skin elasticity by various pharmacological actions. Some xanthones from Garcinia mangostana, mainly α-mangostin, decreased UVB-caused skin wrinkles and suppressed epidermal thickening in hairless mice, in addition to other pharmacological influences [213]. Phenol compounds from Dendrobium loddigesii, including batatasin III, up-regulated collagen synthesis [214], whereas various limonoids from Carapa guainensis, mainly genudin, acetoxygenudin, andirolide H, hydroxygenudin methyl angolensate, and carapanoside C, improved collagen synthesis without cytotoxicity [215]. Triterpenoids from Eriobotrya japonica, mainly ursolic, pomolic, colosolic, and methyl colosolic acids, exhibited anti-aging activity by stimulating collagen and hyaluronic acid synthesis [216]. A plant hormone derived from the jasmonate-caused expression of proteoglycan in the human reconstituted epidermis [217], and a by-product polysaccharide obtained from red ginseng (Panax ginseng) inhibited UV-induced MMP-1 through activator protein-1 (AP-1) [218]. Finally, ferulic acid improved skin elasticity with significant bleaching, anti-redness, smoothing, and moisturizing activity in a clinical study [219].
      On the other hand, plant-based extracts or differential herbal formulations have also been exhaustively studied in several in vitro models, with different pharmacological actions on several mediators of skin elasticity, according to the following classification:Elastase suppress activity was determined after the use of the plant extracts prepared with Eugenia dysenterica [219], Gastrodia elata [220], Litchi sinensis [221], Magnolia officinalis [222], Malaxis acuminata [223], Manilkara zapota [224], Nephelium lappaceum [221], Phyllanthus emblica [224], Sclerocarya birrea [225], Sylibum marianum [224], Spatholobus suberectus [226], Tamarindus indica [221], and a polyherbal formulation containing Nyctanthes arbor-tristis leaf, unripe and ripe Aegle marmelos fruit pulp, and the terminal meristem of Musa paradisiaca extracts [227];An up-regulation in elastin synthesis or gene expression was reported after treatments with plant extracts of Piper cambodianum [228] and Bidens pilosa [229];An up-regulation in pro-collagen expression or synthesis was reported after treatments with plant extracts prepared from Alchemilla mollis [230], Azadirachta indica [231], Camellia sinensis [232], Citrus junus [233], Trapa japonica [234], and a mixture of plant extracts of Kochia scoparia and Rosa multiflora [235];An up-regulation in collagen synthesis or expression was reported after treatments with plant extracts of Andrographis paniculata [236], Cassia fistula [237], Camelia sinensis [238], Passiflora tarminiana [239], Physalis peruviana [240], Piper cambodianum [228], Solanum tuberosum [241], and Bidens pilosa [229];The regulation of hyaluronic acid synthesis was reported after treatments with plant extracts of Cassia fistula [237], Penthorium chinense [241], and Salvia officinalis [242];The reduction of MMP-1 level was observed after treatments with plant extracts of Alchemilla mollis [230], Allium sativum [243], Azadirachta indica [231], Camellia sinensis [232], Gastrodia elata [221], Kochia scoparia [235], Magnolia officinalis [223], Passiflora tarminiana [239], Penthorium chinense [242], Rosa multiflora [235], and Syzygium aromaticum [244];The reduction of MMP-2 level was observed after treatments with plant extracts of Cassia fistula [237], Magnolia officinalis [223], and Pourthiaea villosa [245];A decrease in other metalloproteinases was reported after treatments with plant extracts of Penthorium chinense [241], Piper cambodianum [228], Pousthiaea villosa [245] and Syzygium aromaticum [244];The suppression of the unspecific collagenase activity appeared after treatments with plant extracts of Cassia fistula [237], Curcuma heyneana [246], Eugenia dysenterica [220], Hibiscus sabdariffa [247], Litchi chinens [232], Magnolia officinalis [223], Malaxis acuminate [224], Manilkara zapota [225], Nephelium lappaceum [222], Passiflora tarminiana [240], Phyllanthus emblica [226], Piper cambodianum [228], Sclerocarya birrea [226], Sylibum marianum [225], and Tamarindus indica [222].
      In addition, two clinical experiments were performed to research herbal formulas on skin elasticity. The research explored the anti-aging potential in mammalian skin of topical therapies containing a mixture of Camellia sinensis leaf, Polygonum cuspidatum root, Ginkgo biloba leaf, Cynara scolymus leaf, and Selaginella tamariscina and reported helpful influences on facial skin as well as an improvement in ECM protein production, although the reports are not statistically obvious [248]. An herbal preparation containing Vaccinum vitis-idaea and Phyllanthus emblica was orally administered to volunteers in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical experiment, generating obvious helpful influences on skin elasticity [249]. The effects were associated with improvements in skin thickness and stratum corneum water content and a decrease in facial wrinkles in a dose-dependent manner [249]. Furthermore, a phytocosmetic formulation containing Thymus vulgaris, after its topical application in volunteers, produced a decrease in perioral and crow’s feet wrinkles, accompanied by a decrease in nasolabial and smile lines, and an improvement in face oval remodeling [250].
    
    
      7. Conclusions and Future Prospects
      Skin aging is the direct manifestation of human aging, which is the result of the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The improvement of skin aging is imperative and important to maintain normal physiological functions of the skin and people’s psychological health. In this paper, we review the various nutrients contained in the skin and their important role in maintaining skin health. Furthermore, we also analyze the mechanisms of skin aging as well as current interventions to slow down skin aging, which seems to be a promising approach by supplementing the nutrients contained in the skin itself. However, basic and clinical research to verify whether these additives can be applied in skin anti-aging is still very limited and deserves further exploration.

Title: Diversity of Bioactive Compounds in Microalgae: Key Classes and Functional Applications

Abstract: Microalgae offer a sustainable and versatile source of bioactive compounds. Their rapid growth, efficient CO2 utilization, and adaptability make them a promising alternative to traditional production methods. Key compounds, such as proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), polyphenols, phytosterols, pigments, and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), hold significant commercial value and are widely utilized in food, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals, driving innovation across multiple industries. Their antiviral and enzyme-producing capabilities further enhance industrial and medical applications. Additionally, microalgae-based biostimulants and plant elicitor peptides (PEPs) contribute to sustainable agriculture by enhancing plant growth and resilience to environmental stressors. The GRAS status of several species facilitates market integration, but challenges in scaling and cost reduction remain. Advances in biotechnology and metabolic engineering will optimize production, driving growth in the global microalgae industry. With increasing consumer demand for natural, eco-friendly products, microalgae will play a vital role in health, food security, and environmental sustainability.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Microalgae have emerged as a promising and sustainable alternative for the production of biomass and bioactive compounds, gathering increasing attention across various industries [1]. These organisms can thrive in a variety of water sources, ranging from freshwater to wastewater, providing versatile options for cultivation [2]. Additionally, the application of microalgae biotechnology is expanding commercially, with significant relevance in sectors such as food, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, animal feed, and energy [3,4,5,6,7,8].
      Microalgae, as photosynthetic microorganisms, can be cultivated under controlled conditions to yield high amounts of biomass enriched with valuable compounds such as lipids, proteins, carbohydrates, and pigments. The biomass production of microalgae is an emerging field with significant potential for various industrial applications [9,10]. Their ability to efficiently convert CO2 into organic matter through photosynthesis makes them particularly attractive for sustainable production practices [11,12,13] (Figure 1). Microalgae grow quickly, require minimal space, can grow on non-arable land, and can be cultivated in a variety of environments, including wastewater. They are considered a green source of bioactive compounds, offering an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional methods of industrial production, which often rely on resource-intensive processes. It is important to emphasize that both the microalgal species and the specific growth conditions critically influence the production and accumulation of high-value bioactive compounds. Notably, modulation of growth conditions can significantly impact the accumulation of these compounds [14], particularly through variations in light intensity, medium pH, temperature, and nutrient composition of the culture medium [15,16] (Table 1).
      In the context of food applications, the “Generally Recognized As Safe” (GRAS) designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a critical criterion for evaluating the safety of substances intended for use in food products. Several microalgal species have been granted GRAS status (Table 2), thereby permitting their incorporation as food ingredients in various formulations [17,18,19]. This regulatory approval is essential for facilitating the commercial use of microalgae in the food and nutraceutical sectors. This designation ensures that the organisms are deemed safe for consumption, minimizing the need for extensive purification processes when used in food additives. In contrast, if an organism lacks GRAS status, its derived ingredients must undergo stringent purification to meet safety standards, which can increase production costs. The GRAS status of certain microalgae helps to promote consumer confidence, aids food manufacturers in regulatory compliance, and supports the integration of microalgae into a broader array of food and beverage products [17,18,19]. This contributes to the growth of the functional foods market and supports the development of sustainable, nutrient-rich food sources [20,21]. A list of related products approved by the European Union is available at the European Algae Biomass Association website [22], while the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is also currently evaluating the safety of various microalgae-derived products.
      High added-value compounds from microalgae (Figure 2) refer to substances with significant economic and industrial potential [23,24]. These compounds include proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and antioxidants, and several bioactive compounds including polyphenols, phytosterols, pigments, and mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) [24,25]. These compounds are valuable due to their diverse applications in industries like food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. In addition, other emerging compounds currently under intense research include biostimulants, which enhance plant growth; plant elicitor peptides (PEPs), which activate plant defense mechanisms; antivirals with the potential to inhibit virus activity; and industrial and analytical enzymes, which play critical roles in manufacturing and research [26]. These compounds are anticipated to drive substantial growth in the global microalgae biotechnology market over the next decade, driven by consumer demand for high-quality, eco-friendly, and cost-effective products. This review highlights the increasing prominence of microalgae-derived compounds across agricultural and pharmaceutical applications, underscoring their versatile potential in meeting the needs of diverse industries.

      2. High Added-Value Compounds from Microalgae
      
        2.1. Proteins
        Proteins derived from microalgae are of particular interest due to their high nutritional value, containing essential amino acids necessary for human health and wellbeing [34,35,36,37]. Moreover, microalgae offer a sustainable source of proteins that can be produced efficiently without competing with food crops for arable land. Advances in biotechnological techniques have enabled the optimization of microalgae strains to enhance protein content and productivity, paving the way for their use in food supplements, animal feeds, and biomedical applications [25,38].
        The protein content of microalgae offers a compelling alternative to traditional protein sources, both nutritionally and functionally. For example, proteins derived from Chlorella, Limnospira, and Dunaliella salina contain all essential amino acids required by the human body, making them comparable in nutritional value to animal-based protein sources such as meat, dairy, and eggs [39,40,41]. This makes them particularly valuable for vegetarian and vegan diets, where complete protein sources are often limited.
        Microalgal protein concentrates are primarily utilized as nutraceuticals or added to functional food recipes [39,42,43,44]. In addition, microalgal proteins have been increasingly incorporated into the cosmetics industry, particularly in skincare products. Notably, proteins from the genera Limnospira and Chlorella are among the most commonly utilized sources [13,25,45,46].
      
      
        2.2. Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs)
        Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including arachidonic acid (AA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and γ-linolenic acid (GLA), are essential fatty acids that support cardiovascular health, cognitive development, and immune function [47]. As the human body cannot synthesize these fatty acids, they must be obtained through diet, making external sources vital for human health and nutrition.
        Microalgae are recognized as a sustainable and efficient source of PUFAs, particularly as alternatives to fish-derived oils. Several species have demonstrated high PUFA production capacity, including Chaetoceros calcitrans, Monodus subterraneus, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Porphyridium cruentum, Nannochloropsis spp., Crypthecodinium cohnii, Tisochrysis lutea, Pavlova gyrans, and Pavlova sp. [48,49]. These microalgae produce a diverse array of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and are increasingly utilized in functional foods and nutraceutical formulations aimed at delivering anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects. The green microalga Lobosphaera incisa is an oleaginous eukaryotic alga that is rich in AA (20:4) [50].
        Limnospira contributes to this group as a notable source of GLA, a rare omega-6 fatty acid with known health-promoting properties [47]. While its total PUFA content may be lower, compared to some marine microalgae, Limnospira’s accessibility, nutritional profile, and regulatory approval for human consumption have made it a popular ingredient in supplements and fortified products. Collectively, PUFA-rich microalgae offer promising applications in the nutraceutical sector, providing plant-based, environmentally friendly sources of essential fatty acids to meet growing consumer demand for sustainable health solutions.
      
      
        2.3. Polyphenols
        To counteract oxidative stress arising from both endogenous and environmental sources, microalgae produce a diverse range of high- and low-molecular-weight antioxidant molecules. Among these are polyphenols, a broad class of secondary metabolites that includes flavonoids, isoflavonoids, phenolic acids, lignans, and stilbenes [51,52,53,54,55]. The primary benefit of polyphenolic compounds for human health lies in their potent antioxidant activity. Phenolic compounds enhance cellular antioxidant capacity by upregulating enzymes involved in oxygen metabolism and xenobiotic detoxification, while simultaneously downregulating signaling pathways associated with inflammation. Through these mechanisms, they effectively scavenge and reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species [56,57]. Flavonoids, a major subclass of polyphenols, exhibit a range of additional health-promoting effects. Compounds such as luteolin, quercetin, and rutin are particularly notable for their potential in treating cardiovascular disorders, largely due to the presence of a catechol group in the B-ring and an unsaturated C2–C3 bond in conjunction with a 4-oxo function—structural features associated with strong antioxidant and vascular-protective activities. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a target of modern medications for the treatment of arterial hypertension, is naturally inhibited by other flavonoids such as kaempferol and apigenin. Moreover, some polyphenols have antiviral activities [53]. The primary mechanism for suppressing viral replication, mostly of ssRNA-positive viruses, is polyphenols’ capacity to prevent reactive oxygen species from spreading within cell systems [58]. In the instance of coronavirus infection (SARS-CoV-2), apigenin and kaempferol block the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), which contributes to virus entrance into lung cells [53]. Another group called phlorotannins can prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from replicating [59]. In the context of cosmetic applications, microalgal extracts rich in polyphenols are already utilized in products designed to promote hair growth, protect against UV-induced damage, regulate skin pigmentation, enhance skin firmness, and combat signs of aging [60]. In addition to their health-promoting properties, polyphenols, when incorporated into cosmetic and nutraceutical formulations, also function as effective natural preservatives. Their antioxidant activity helps extend the shelf life of foods and beverages by enhancing overall antioxidant capacity and preventing oxidation-induced degradation [57,61]. Limnospira species have also been shown to be rich in antioxidant compounds, such as phenolic acids [62,63,64]. Additionally, the nitrogen-fixing genera Nostoc and Anabaena are of particular interest due to their notable antiviral, antioxidant, and anticancer activities [65,66,67].
      
      
        2.4. Phytosterols
        More than 100 different types of phytosterols have been identified so far [68] (Figure 3). The phytosterols used in industry mainly originate from plants [69]; however, microalgae are also a valuable source. Various classes of algae—including Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae, and Rhodophyceae—have been reported to produce phytosterols [70]. For instance, species such as Nannochloropsis gaditana, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Nannochloropsis sp., and Tisochrysis lutea have been shown to contain phytosterols ranging from 7 to 34 g/kg dry weight (0.7–3.4%) [71]. Additionally, Tetraselmis sp. M8, Pavlova lutheri, and Nannochloropsis sp. BR2 have demonstrated phytosterol contents between 0.4% and 2.6% of dry weight. P. lutheri has been reported to reach up to 5.1%, depending on factors such as cultivation medium, salinity, and growth duration [71,72,73].
        Several studies have reported that dietary phytosterol intake can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients such as β-carotene and vitamin E [74]. As a result, it is often recommended to increase the intake of these micronutrients concurrently to compensate for the reduced absorption caused by phytosterols [75]. However, microalgae present a promising alternative to multiple supplementations, as they can naturally provide high levels of essential nutrients, including vitamins, phytosterols, and antioxidants, potentially fulfilling a substantial portion of human dietary requirements. However, microalgae could substitute the multi-supplements, since they could cover most human dietary needs in vitamins, phytosterol content, and antioxidants.
        Phytosterols have been widely recognized for their beneficial effects on human health [72,76]. Regular consumption of 2–3 g per day has been shown to effectively lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, thereby supporting cardiovascular health. In addition to their lipid-lowering properties, phytosterols also exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, and anticancer activities [77]. Notably, ergosterol, a phytosterol found in microalgae, has demonstrated significant cytostatic effects against human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells [78]. Furthermore, fucosterol and its oxygenated derivatives, isolated from the brown alga Sargassum carpophyllum, have shown cytotoxic activity against various cancer cell lines [79].
      
      
        2.5. Pigments
        The primary pigments in microalgae are classified as chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phycobilins (Figure 4). These compounds have been shown in recent years to exhibit valuable health-promoting properties, including antioxidant activity, provitamin functionality, immune modulation, and anti-inflammatory effects [80,81]. Consequently, they are primarily utilized in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries as natural colorants, dietary supplements, or sources of bioactivity [82].
        
          2.5.1. Chlorophylls
          Chlorophylls (Figure 4a) are found in all photoautotrophic organisms and are necessary for photosynthesis [83,84]. Chlorophylls are gaining increasing importance as natural colorants in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries due to their intense green pigmentation and the rising consumer preference for naturally derived ingredients [85,86]. Microalgae of the genus Chlorella, whose chlorophyll content represents about 7% of its biomass (five times more than that of Limnospira [42]), are widely used as chlorophyll producers.
        
        
          2.5.2. Carotenoids
          Carotenoids are another class of pigments that are abundantly found in microalgae. The primary characteristics of these vividly colored molecules, which range in hue from yellow to red, are their antioxidant capabilities and dyeing ability [85,86,87]. Carotenoids are important pigments that play a significant role in photosynthesis, having a double function, in light harvesting and in protecting the photosynthetic apparatus from excess energy [88,89]. These carotenoids are characterized as primary carotenoids and are essential for cellular survival. On the other hand, secondary carotenoids are not necessary for photosynthesis [90] but they are accumulated in stressful conditions like high light, salinity, and nutrient starvation [91,92].
          The biosynthesis of carotenoids in photosynthetic microalgae starts from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) or dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). In the presence of desaturase, ζ-carotene can be formed in algae or higher plants (the metabolic pathways in bacteria or fungi would slightly differ). Astaxanthin, an economically important carotenoid, is usually synthesized from canthaxanthin or zeaxanthin by photosynthetic microalgae [93]. Although carotenoids can be synthesized chemically at a lower cost, their use has been associated with potential health risks, including an increased incidence of certain diseases such as lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases [94,95]. Thus, safety concerns lead to the increased market of the natural pigments, especially for human consumption [96]. Nevertheless, the cost of naturally produced carotenoids using microalgae is still questionable.
          Haematococcus lacustris, Dunaliella salina, Chromochloris zofingiensis, and Chlorella vulgaris are the main species initially considered for the commercial production of carotenoids in large-scale cultures [90,97]. Many additional microalgal species are capable of producing and accumulating secondary carotenoids, particularly when cultivated under stress conditions such as high light intensity, nitrogen limitation, or salt stress [90]. Notable examples include Auxenochlorella protothecoides [98] and Scenedesmus almeriensis [99]. β-carotene is the first high-value product to be manufactured commercially from microalgae (Figure 4b) [100]. According to Bhalamurugan et al. (2018) [49] and Khanra et al. (2018) [42], Scenedesmus almeriensis and Dunaliella tertiolecta are notable microalgal producers of β-carotene. However, the most abundant and commercially significant natural source of β-carotene remains Dunaliella salina [100,101].
          Microalgae-derived carotenoids have a wide range of applications across multiple industries. In the food industry, they are commonly used as natural additives for coloring and for their strong antioxidant properties [102]. For example, astaxanthin is employed as a natural antioxidant that can prevent lipid oxidation and extend the shelf life of food products. Haematococcus lacustris’ ability to produce over 50 mg/g of astaxanthin makes it a significant natural source of this valuable carotenoid.
          Another important area of application for carotenoids is the pharmaceutical industry, where they are valued for their therapeutic properties. Several carotenoids have been shown to offer protective effects against chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. For instance, β-carotene, fucoxanthin, and astaxanthin exhibit notable anticancer activity. Notably, Palozza et al. (2005) [103] reported that β-carotene inhibits the proliferation of human colon cancer cell lines. Fucoxanthin is reported to be a promising anticancer carotenoid that inhibits the growth of SK-hepatoma, leukemia cells, and prostate cancer [104]. Astaxanthin has been shown to play a protective role in cardiovascular health, primarily due to its potent antioxidant activity and its ability to reduce inflammation and lower LDL cholesterol levels [105,106]. In addition to their pharmaceutical benefits, carotenoids are widely used in the cosmetics industry for their antioxidant properties and anti-UV protective effects. These compounds are also believed to promote skin health by enhancing elasticity, improving hydration, and refining texture [107,108,109,110].
        
        
          2.5.3. Phycobiliproteins
          Phycobiliproteins (PBPs), are a family of natural pigment–proteins from microalgae containing phycobilins (Figure 4c–f) [111]. PBPs are heterodimeric proteins composed of α and β subunits, with the β subunits being slightly larger than their α counterparts. Three (αβ) monomers assemble into (αβ) trimers, forming a circular disk-like structure (Figure 5). These trimers can further associate to create (αβ) hexamers. Each PBP subunit carries one to three linear tetrapyrrole chromophores, known as phycobilins, which are covalently bound to specific cysteine residues. The absorption properties of PBPs are determined by the type of phycobilins they contain (Figure 4c–f), including phycocyanobilin (PCB, λmax = 640 nm), phycoerythrobilin (PEB, λmax = 550 nm), phycourobilin (PUB, λmax = 490 nm), and phycoviolobilin (PVB, λmax = 590 nm) (λmax was determined in distilled water). Based on their spectral characteristics, PBPs are categorized into three primary groups, allophycocyanin (APC), phycocyanin (PC), and phycoerythrin (PE), with additional subtypes distinguished by their unique absorption spectra.
          Various microalgal species, such as Limnospira platensis, Porphyridium sp., Aphanizomenon gracile, Neopyropia yezoensis, the red alga Porphyridium purpureum, and several cryptophytes, are known to accumulate different levels of phycobiliproteins (PBPs), depending on cultivation conditions. For example, the Nostoc sp. SW02 strain has been reported to achieve a high PBP content (31.9%) when cultured under low light intensity and nutrient-limited conditions [111]. Industrial production of these pigments involves the utilization of the species Porphyridium sp., Limnospira sp., and Aphanizomenon flosaquae [48,49,80,81,85,86].
          Phycobiliproteins (PBPs) are of significant commercial interest, not only as natural colorants but also for their potential pharmaceutical applications. PBPs have demonstrated a range of therapeutic properties, including antitumor, antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and neuroprotective effects. Among them, phycocyanin (PC), a well-studied member of the PBP family, has shown the ability to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells without harming normal cells [112]. Furthermore, PBPs have been reported to induce cell cycle arrest in various cancer types, including liver cancer [113], breast cancer [114], leukemia [115], lung cancer [116], and bone marrow cancer [117].
          PBPs are highly used as colorants in the food industry due to their nontoxic nature. PC, extracted from L. platensis, when added to ice-cream can maintain its color for up to 182 days [118], and when added to yogurt, it increases color stability, viscosity, and, due to its antibacterial activity, extends the yogurt’s life [119]. Phycobiliproteins combined with skimmed milk result in a mixture of enhanced chemical stability and antioxidant capacity, which can be considered as an innovative beverage [120].
          PBPs are also used as natural colorants in the cosmetics industry, in products like creams, lipsticks, and eyeliners [120]. Novel cosmetics using PBPs are also under development.
          One main role of PBPs is to scavenge free radicals; thus, PBPs play an important protective role in different organs like the liver and kidneys and systems like the nervous and cardiovascular systems [121]. PBPs have also been found to play a protective role and improve Alzheimer’s disease symptoms, as they reduce the accumulation of amyloid β plaques in the brain [122].
          PBPs are widely utilized as analytical reagents in molecular biology laboratories and serve as markers in various immunological techniques, including flow cytometry, microscopy, and DNA assays. Their strong and highly sensitive fluorescent properties make them particularly valuable for these applications [43,81,85,86,123,124].
        
      
      
        2.6. Biostimulants
        Plant development can be enhanced by the application of microalgae, cyanobacteria, or their formulations, such as biomass, extracts, or hydrolysates. The effectiveness of these biostimulants depends on the species of microalgae and the origin of the formulation used [6,125,126,127]. Furthermore, the combination of biostimulants with a specific plant species and the growing conditions play an equally important role. In addition, both the developmental stage and the environmental conditions at the time of the biostimulant application can directly influence the success of the biostimulant treatment. Biostimulant application has a direct impact on plant growth rate and yield, which is important especially for leafy vegetables like lettuce or spinach and herbs like oregano and basil, while it has been shown that it enhances their development under abiotic stress conditions. Biostimulants trigger nitrogen and carbon metabolism, resulting in enhanced growth. At the same time the carbohydrate, leaf, protein, and photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll and carotenoid) content is increased [6,127]. Moreover, the application of biostimulants increases the metabolite content, which in turn improves the quality of the products and extents their shelf life. Biostimulants also enhance germination rates, resulting in early flowering and increased numbers of flowers. Finally, polysaccharide extracts from microalgae species like Chlorella sorokiniana, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Porphirydium spp., and Dunaliella salina enhance the expression of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase in tomato plants under salt stress and thus can serve as biostimulants [128]. Additionally, green microalgae have the ability to produce lactic acid, a chiral organic acid that is essential for plant growth and development [126].
      
      
        2.7. Plant Elicitor Peptides (PEPs)
        Plant elicitor peptides (PEPs) constitute a novel tool for sustainable agriculture. As endogenous elicitors, PEPs contribute to the defense mechanisms of plants against bacterial, fungal, and herbivorous threats [129]. In agricultural applications, microalgae can function as stimulants for plant defense systems. These organisms release chemical compounds and structural components that induce a plant’s defensive responses. When applied directly to crop roots, microalgae activate systemic defense responses in plants, as the interactions between microalgae and plants are bidirectional. This phenomenon has led to the identification of priming-type responses in various crops, although the specific microalgae and molecules responsible remain unidentified. For instance, when broccoli and guar plant roots were inoculated with Chlorella vulgaris, it resulted in increased activity of antioxidant enzymes, including APX, CAT, SOD, and glutathione reductase. Furthermore, this inoculation induced an accumulation of flavonoid and phenolic compounds [130]. The elicitation technique has practical applications in the industrial sector, particularly in the production of plant-cell-derived chemicals. Plants employ defense mechanisms similar to priming to prepare for potential pathogen invasions. In cucumber plants, the foliar inoculation of Desmodesmus abundans triggers Systemic Acquired Resistance (SAR) and induces various cellular changes, which help mitigate the effects of Colletotrichum orbiculare disease. These cellular modifications include the accumulation of vesicles, the formation of sheaths around penetration hyphae, and the thickening of cell walls adjacent to intracellular hyphae [130]. Research conducted by Rachidi et al. in 2021 [131] has demonstrated that polysaccharides extracted from various microalgae species, including Chlorella and Dunaliella (members of Chlorophyta), as well as Porphyridium (belonging to Rhodophyta), function as effective plant elicitors in tomatoes. This elicitation results in enhanced activity of defense-related enzymes and increased synthesis of protective compounds, such as polyphenols and steroidal glycoalkaloids [131]. The exopolysaccharides produced by Porphyridium sordidum stimulate the expression of SA-related genes and PAL activity in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, leading to decreased incidence of diseases caused by Fusarium oxysporum [132]. Additionally, green microalgae have the ability to produce lactic acid, a chiral organic acid that is essential for plant growth and development [133]. Poveda et al. (2022) have investigated the possibility of microalgae elicitors passing on plant defense activation to future generations. They cultivated tomato, pepper, and eggplant in vermicompost containing microalgae species Ulothrix spp. (Chlorophyta) and Navicula spp. (Ochrophyta). The seeds collected from these plants were then germinated in the presence of the pathogenic oomycete Pythium sp. Results showed a 90% increase in seedling survival, indicating a potential inherited resistance [134]. Rao et al. (2001) studied the effects of two microalgal species, Haematococcus lacustris and Limnospira platensis, used as elicitor treatments, on the accumulation of betalaines and thiophenes in hairy root cultures of Beta vulgaris and Tagetes patula. Treating B. vulgaris hairy roots with H. lacustris and L. platensis extracts significantly increased biomass to 165.3 g and 149.4 g fresh wt/L, respectively, from an initial 1.25 g fresh wt/L. Betalaine content in H. lacustris-treated B. vulgaris hairy roots increased 2.28-fold by day 15, while L. platensis-treated roots showed a 1.16-fold increase by day 25. For T. patula, H. lacustris extract did not affect growth or thiophene accumulation, but thiophene levels increased 1.2-fold by day 20 compared to controls. The study concludes that L. platensis extract enhanced betalaine production in B. vulgaris hairy roots, while H. lacustris extract improved betalaine and thiophene production in B. vulgaris and T. patula hairy roots, respectively [135].
        Microalgae-based biopesticides have demonstrated effectiveness against bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes, although the specific active compound remains unidentified. Consequently, a key challenge for researchers is to pinpoint all the relevant target substances. Furthermore, the majority of experiments involving microalgal and macroalgal elicitors have been conducted in controlled environments such as in vitro systems, growth chambers, or greenhouses. This underscores the necessity for comprehensive and stringent field trials to validate their efficacy in real-world conditions [136]. The pursuit of sustainable solutions in contemporary agriculture has been driven by the recognition of chemical pesticides’ and fertilizers’ deleterious effects on the environment and human health. The transition away from conventional farming practices is simultaneously urgent and complex. It is imperative to examine the tissues affected by elicitor peptides and investigate the intricate interplay between these peptides and phytohormones in relation to various stress conditions, both abiotic and biotic.
      
      
        2.8. Mycosporine-like Amino Acids (MAAs)
        Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) represent a distinctive group of marine-derived natural compounds known for their exceptional sun protection capabilities [137,138,139,140,141,142]. A remarkable feature of these compounds is their strong UV absorption, characterized by molar absorptivities (ε) of approximately 40,000 L × mol−1 × cm−1 [138,139]. MAAs are hydrophilic, low-molecular-weight compounds (typically <400 Da), consisting of either an aminocyclohexenone or aminocyclohexenimine core, with nitrogen or amino alcohol functional groups as substituents. The structures of some common MAAs isolated from cyanobacteria and microalgae are depicted in Figure 6. MAAs represent a viable natural option for both direct UV absorption and indirect antioxidant defense, owing to their strong photostability and non-toxic nature [141]. They provide photoprotection against UV-A and UV-B irradiation and exhibit distinctive absorption spectra characterized by a single, narrow, and intense absorption band, with peak absorbance occurring between 310 and 365 nm [143,144].
        Research indicates that MAAs originate from the early stages of the shikimate pathway. However, the precise biochemical synthesis pathway and its underlying genetic basis remain largely unexplored [140]. Cyanobacteria are the oldest group of organisms known to synthesize MAAs. Understanding the biosynthetic pathway of MAAs is crucial for optimizing their production. Future research aims to enhance the expression of genes involved in MAA biosynthesis in microalgae by manipulating culture conditions, thereby enabling the co-production of various UV-protective compounds. This approach would expand UV coverage and streamline the production process [139,140,141,142].
        MAAs are naturally occurring in aquatic organisms, both marine and freshwater, with microalgae serving as one of the most efficient MAA cell factories. In most species, MAAs are deposited extracellularly, often due to growth in biofilms or colonies. Emerging research suggests that MAAs may possess functions beyond their primary role. These compounds exhibit several important biological functions, including antioxidant activity through the neutralization of reactive oxygen species and serving as compatible solutes under salt stress conditions. In various biological systems, MAAs play a critical role in regulating osmotic balance in microalgae, cyanobacteria, and yeasts. Additionally, these versatile molecules contribute to cellular protection by scavenging free oxygen radicals and enhancing resistance to desiccation and high salinity. Two specific MAAs, mycosporine-glycine and porphyra-334, demonstrate potent antioxidant properties [145]. Microalgae synthesize MAAs when subjected to dehydration, heat, or cold stress. Furthermore, MAAs have been hypothesized to function as auxiliary pigments for light harvesting during photosynthesis and as internal nitrogen reservoirs [146,147]. More recently, novel mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), named klebsormidins A and B, have been identified in green algal species belonging to the Interfilum and Klebsormidium genera, which are known to inhabit extreme environments with high levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). In these genera, two additional MAAs, designated as MAA1 and MAA2, have also been discovered [148]. Furthermore, the red alga Bostrychia scorpioides has been reported to produce six novel MAAs, termed bostrychines, while Catenella caespitosa has been found to synthesize two unique MAAs, known as catenellines [149]. Notably, Bostrychia scorpioides, which thrives in harsh environments characterized by osmotic stress, desiccation, and intense UV exposure, has also been shown to produce a distinct group of seven MAAs called bostrycines [150].
        The potential of MAAs as anticancer agents has been well demonstrated, particularly through their ability to inhibit the proliferation of neoplastic cells [137,138,139,140,141,142]. Furthermore, MAAs have demonstrated wound-healing properties in in vitro studies using HaCaT keratinocyte cells. The underlying mechanism of MAA action involves the activation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Upon introduction of MAA compounds, they induce FAK phosphorylation, which subsequently leads to the activation of MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinase [151].
        The development of advanced bioprocessing and efficient downstream processing strategies is essential for optimizing the production of MAAs from microalgae. Further research is needed to identify and understand all the key factors influencing MAA production. Bioscreening microalgae for the distribution and quantification of MAAs is a crucial aspect of microalgal biotechnology. Additionally, extraction processes must be refined by focusing on critical variables, such as temperature, duration of sonication or other extraction techniques, and the type and quantity of solvent used. These parameters are pivotal in maximizing extraction efficiency and yield [152].
      
      
        2.9. Antivirals
        Looking back at recent decades, pathogenic viruses have been a constant cause of the most severe epidemics that humans have faced. The most recent outbreaks, caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the H1N1 influenza virus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ebola virus, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), left a severe impact on our society. In the following reviews, one can find an excellent overview of the current status regarding viral pandemics [153,154,155].
        Algal compounds such as lectins and carbohydrates inhibit viral activity by forming unique bonds through selective, non-covalent interactions with viral proteins (Figure 7A) [156,157,158,159]. Carbohydrates, such as polysaccharides, can prevent infection in a number of ways [156,157,158]. Polysaccharides have been found to induce the host’s immune response to viral infection by increasing the synthesis of interferons, enhancing the proliferation of lymphocytes, and increasing the effectiveness of macrophages and NK cells (Figure 7B). Due to their negative charge, some polysaccharides can intervene in the adsorption of viruses by neutralizing their respective positive charge (Figure 7C). Polysaccharides and lectins can prevent viral infections in another way, which involves their ability to bind to either viral or host proteins (Figure 7D,F). When they bind to viral envelope proteins, they effectively inhibit the interaction between the host receptor and the viral surface protein. In addition, by binding to the host’s receptor, they occupy the binding site, which further prevents the interaction between the host and the virus. Sulfated marine polysaccharides, in particular, can impede virus internalization and uncoating by hindering the conformational changes in virus particles (Figure 7E).
        Lectins are intriguing non-immune proteins that exhibit reversible selectivity for certain glycan moieties [154,155,156]. These proteins are widely distributed and identifiable in all living things, including viruses and animals. Various animal and terrestrial plant lectins have been refined and described, and a portion of these are being offered for sale for use in scientific and medical contexts, such as blood type analysis, cancer diagnosis, carbohydrate profiling, karyotyping, and evaluating patient immunocompetence [159]. Algae are a significant source of lectins, as evidenced by recent studies that described the purification, characterization, and classification of hemagglutinins from various algae species (Rhodophyta and Chlorophyta) with distinct molecular structures, biological activities, and non-promising sugar-binding specificity. Recent research has also divided lectins from algae and cyanobacteria into three primary groups: lectins specific to high mannose (HM), lectins specific to N-glycan, and lectins that exhibit specificity towards both based on their ability to bind carbohydrates [160,161,162]. The lectins purified from blue-green algae, Microcystis aeruginosa PCC7806 (Microvirin or MVN), Microcystis viridis NIES-102 (MVL), and Nostoc ellipsosporum (Cyanovirin-N or CV-N) (Figure 8) were among the lectins that demonstrated specificity towards the HM class [163,164,165]. The distinct carbohydrate specificity of marine algal and cyanobacterial lectins, which gives them their antiviral activity, has drawn the interest of researchers. According to reports, these lectins work against viruses by interacting with viral high-mannose glycan, which is added to the viral envelope proteins as a post-translational modification and serves as a common entry point for viruses with half-maximum effective concentrations (EC50) in the nanomolar range [165,166,167,168].
        A novel lectin isolated from Halimeda renschii named HRL40 showed high in vitro inhibition against infection by influenza A virus [169]. A screening of 12 lectins showed that ESA-2, a lectin from the red alga Eucheuma serra, showed high viral inhibition against many influenza A strains [162]. Both of these lectins showed specific binding to highmannose N-glycans (HM-glycans) and inhibited infection with half-maximal effective doses (ED50) at picomolar to low nanomolar concentrations. Two lectins isolated from the species Nostoc muscorum also showed potent antiviral activity against HCV [170]. Nostoc muscorum lectin-1 (NML-1) binds preferentially to complex glycoproteins and employs its antiviral activity at the time of viral entry. Nostoc muscorum lectin-2 (NML-2), the second lectin analyzed, is specific to mannose polymers and inhibits viral activity post viral entry. Recently, an oscillatorial lectin isolated from the species Oscillatoria acuminate demonstrated virucidal qualities against herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) [171]. Another newly characterized lectin from the cyanobacterium Lyngbya confervoides also showed high levels of inhibitory properties against HSV-1 [172].
        Vero cells pre-treated with pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) extracts from Haematococcus lacustris and Dunaliella salina demonstrated approximately 85% and 65% inhibition of infection, respectively, against herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) [173]. The ability to inhibit viral infections is believed to correlate with the polysaccharide content of the PLE extracts. In the case of PLE extracts from H. lacustris, short-chain fatty acids are the compounds believed to inhibit infection, while in the case of D. salina extracts, β-ionone, neophytadiene, phytol, palmitic acid, and α-linolenic acid are the active compounds related to viral infection inhibition. It is worth noting that cells treated with these specific PLE extracts post infection, or simultaneously with infection, did not show any protection against HSV-1. In another example, crude extracts from six microalgal species have demonstrated antiviral activity against cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) [174]. Specifically, ethanolic extracts obtained via accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) from Limnospira platensis, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella kessleri, Haematococcus lacustris, Nostoc punctiforme, and Scenedesmus obliquus were shown to reduce viral DNA replication in vitro at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Moreover, a collection of 38 microalgal and cyanobacterial extracts was used to screen their inhibitory effects against the influenza A and B viruses [175]. The extract with the greatest inhibitory capabilities was from the Chlorellaceae family, while extracts from the Desmidiaceae and Scenedesmaceae families also showed high inhibition of viral replication. Two extracts from the green microalga Neochloris oleoabundans have shown protective effects against the HCoV-229E virus [176]. Cells treated prior to and during infection by the virus had highly reduced viral load, while post-infection treatment had no significant changes.
        Polysaccharide extracts from Laminaria japonica have been shown to inhibit the replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with a demonstrated therapeutic index (TI) far greater than that of other drugs used against RSV [177]. The bioactive molecule responsible for the inhibitory properties of this aqueous extract is believed to be fucoidan, a long-chained sulfated polysaccharide. Fucoidan extracted from the species Cladosiphon okamuranus has also been reported to have virucidal properties against the Newcastle disease virus (NDV), one of the most severe pathogenic agents affecting birds [178]. Intriguingly, fucoidan showed better antiviral properties when compared to ribavirin, a drug used to combat NDV, due to its greatly lower toxicity. Another microalga with a sulfated polysaccharide capable of inhibiting viral infection is Gyrodinium impudium. The polysaccharide p-KG03, derived from Gyrodinium impudicum, has been identified as a specific entry inhibitor of influenza A virus, while also exhibiting non-specific inhibitory activity against influenza B virus entry [179]. It is proposed that p-KG03 interferes with multiple stages of the viral life cycle, including virus attachment, internalization into host cells, and possibly early replication events.
      
      
        2.10. Analytical and Industrial Enzymes
        Enzyme biotechnology has a positive impact on societal challenges and contributes to sustainable development in various industries, especially food, cosmetics, textiles, and feed [180,181,182,183,184,185]. Currently, the enzyme biotechnology industry primarily relies on microbial and animal enzymes, but consumer demand for alternative sustainable sources is growing due to the negative perception of animal-derived products. The development of enzymes from green and sustainable sources, like microalgae, is crucial for meeting this demand [180]. Enzymes derived from algae, such as hydrolases, cellulases, lipases, and pectinases, hold significant promise for industrial and biotechnological applications due to their diverse functionalities and sustainable production methods. Microalgae, including both prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic photosynthetic microorganisms, are particularly advantageous as enzyme biofactories because they can be cultivated in photobioreactors, allowing for high biomass production in a cost-effective manner [186,187]. These enzymes are utilized across various industries, including food, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and biofuels, due to their ability to catalyze specific reactions efficiently. For example, cellulases are crucial in degrading cellulosic materials, essential for biofuel production and waste management [188]. Similarly, pectinases, which account for a significant portion of the global enzyme market, are vital in processes such as fruit juice clarification and textile processing [189,190].
        The genetic diversity of microalgae offers a rich source of novel enzymes, and advances in genomics and transcriptomics are facilitating the identification and characterization of these enzymes for industrial use [186,187]. Moreover, the marine environment, with its vast biodiversity, provides unique enzymes that can withstand extreme conditions, making them suitable for various biotechnological applications [191]. The potential of algae as a sustainable source of industrial enzymes is further enhanced by their minimal nutritional requirements and the ability to produce enzymes with unique physicochemical properties, which are often more efficient than those derived from traditional microbial sources [192,193]. As research continues to explore and optimize the production of algal enzymes, their role in industrial applications is expected to expand, offering eco-friendly and economically viable alternatives to chemical catalysts [194,195].
        The diversity of microalgae ecosystems is a potential source of useful enzymes for industry [196]. The vast metabolic diversity of microalgae likely corresponds to an equally extensive catalytic diversity, much of which remains unexplored. As a result, the diverse array of microalgal species holds great promise for the discovery of novel enzymes and biocatalysts, with the potential to drive industrial biotechnology toward greater economic viability and sustainability [180]. Due to their adaptation to unique environmental conditions, microalgae serve as a valuable source of enzymes with potentially advantageous traits, including enhanced salt tolerance, hyper-thermostability, cold adaptability, and barophilicity. Additionally, they may exhibit novel chemical and stereochemical properties, further expanding their biotechnological potential [197]. Recent microalgae genomics projects reveal potential novel enzyme genes for biotechnological applications. These enzymes often have unique properties, making them useful for industrial applications [198,199]. For example, enzymes from microalgae have shown significant potential in environmental remediation, particularly in the biodegradation of high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), where proteomic studies have revealed key enzymatic activities involved in pollutant degradation pathways [200]. In the bioenergy sector, microalgal enzymes such as hydrogenase and nitrogenase are being engineered to improve bio-hydrogen production, presenting a sustainable route to clean energy [201]. Additionally, specific enzymes play a central role in directing carbon allocation and carbohydrate accumulation in microalgae, which is critical for optimizing biomass for bioethanol production [202]. In the health and nutrition fields, microalgal enzymes contribute to the biosynthesis of high-value carotenoids like astaxanthin and zeaxanthin, with genome-based studies identifying hundreds of key enzymes across various algal species [203].
        The cosmetics industry is expected to drive significant growth in the global industrial enzyme market over the next decade, as consumers demand high-quality, eco-friendly, and cost-effective products [204]. In cosmetics, enzymes are being explored in anti-aging applications, as well as in the treatment of certain skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and acne. They have the potential to offer a natural and safe alternative to conventional treatments, which often rely on harsh chemicals or synthetic materials [205,206].
        Proteases have diverse applications across multiple industries, including food processing, detergents, and cosmetics, among others [207,208,209,210]. They are used to hydrolyze proteins, improve the texture and flavor of food, and remove stains and dirt, and they have an effect on skin exfoliation and turnover of skin cells. In dermatology, proteolytic enzymes are being explored for their potential in promoting smooth wound healing and facilitating the removal of necrotic tissue from burns and injuries [211,212]. In addition to debridement, proteolytic enzymes are being evaluated for other skin-related benefits, such as improving the appearance of aging skin, reducing scarring, and promoting wound healing [207,208,209,210]. Microalgae-derived proteases offer several advantages over plant-based counterparts, including greater stability and activity across a broader range of pH and temperature conditions. These properties make them particularly well suited for cosmetic and dermatological applications. For example, Ioannou and Labrou (2022) investigated the proteolytic activity of Limnospira platensis lysate [213]. Proteolytic activity was utilized to develop a hydrogel formulation as an enzyme-based cosmeceutical, with potential application as a topical exfoliating agent. The incorporation of L. platensis extract into the hydrogel significantly enhanced the enzyme’s long-term operational stability, a crucial advantage in the development of enzyme-based products [213]. Moreover, microalgae utilize antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidases, and glutathione reductase to mitigate oxidative stress caused by environmental factors, heavy metals, and chemical exposure. These enzymes not only play a critical role in enhancing microalgal stress tolerance and supporting therapeutic antioxidant development but are also increasingly exploited in the cosmetics industry for their ability to protect skin cells from oxidative damage, reduce inflammation, and promote anti-aging effects [214].
      
    
    
      3. Conclusions
      Given their environmental and economic benefits, microalgae represent a pivotal resource for sustainable production across industries. Their role in carbon sequestration and wastewater treatment further underscores their ecological significance. Microalgae-derived compounds possess considerable commercial value and are extensively applied in the food, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and agricultural sectors, driving innovation across multiple industries. Challenges such as optimizing culture conditions, scaling production, and reducing costs need to be addressed to maximize commercial potential. Continued research in genetic engineering, metabolic pathways, and advanced bioprocessing techniques are crucial in unlocking their full capabilities. Microalgae-derived innovations are expected to play a crucial role in addressing global challenges related to health, food security, and environmental sustainability.

Title: Protective Effects of Xanthorrhizol-Rich Extracts Against PM-Induced Skin Damage in Human Keratinocytes and 3D-Reconstructed Skin Models

Abstract: Background: Particulate matter (PM) is a major environmental pollutant that induces oxidative stress, inflammation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, leading to skin damage and accelerated aging. Xanthorrhizol (XAN), a bioactive compound derived from Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb., exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, making it a promising candidate for protecting against PM-induced skin damage. This study investigated the protective effects of XAN and C. xanthorrhiza supercritical extract (CXSE) on PM-exposed skin cells. Methods: A 3D-reconstructed skin model and HaCaT human keratinocytes were exposed to PM (100 µg/mL) with or without CXSE or XAN. Histological analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and reporter gene assays were performed to assess the ECM integrity, inflammatory cytokine production, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation, and oxidative stress responses. Results: PM exposure activates AhR and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling, increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and upregulates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inflammatory cytokines. CXSE and XAN suppresses AhR-mediated transcriptional activity and downregulates the expression of AhR target genes. Additionally, CXSE and XAN reduces ROS production by upregulating antioxidant enzyme-related genes. Conclusions: CXSE and XAN protect against PM-induced skin damage by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation, and ECM degradation, highlighting their potential as natural anti-pollution skincare ingredients.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb., or Java turmeric, has been widely used in traditional medicine due to its broad spectrum of biological activities [1]. Among its bioactive compounds, XAN (Figure 1A) is notable for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective properties [1,2,3,4]. Previous studies have shown that XAN can effectively modulate key inflammatory pathways by reducing the phosphorylation of MAPKs and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, in various cell types [5,6]. These findings suggest that XAN may attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation, highlighting its potential for therapeutic applications in skincare.
      Particulate matter (PM), a complex mixture of airborne pollutants, is a major environmental concern due to its adverse health effects that induce oxidative stress and inflammation in biological systems [7,8,9,10,11]. Notably, both the incidence and mortality rates of diseases associated with PM exposure are increasing [12,13]. Exposure to PM generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate the MAPK signaling cascade and NF-κB, thereby subsequently upregulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other inflammatory mediators [14,15,16]. This signaling cascade degrades extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as collagen and elastin, thereby promoting skin inflammation and accelerating aging processes [17,18,19]. While much of the research on PM has focused on respiratory effects, its impact on the skin, the body’s outermost barrier, has emerged as an important target for intervention [20,21].
      The skin, which is continuously exposed to environmental pollutants, is particularly vulnerable to PM-induced damage [20,22,23,24]. PM exposure is associated with increased oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and the development of skin conditions, such as erythema, dryness, and wrinkles [25]. Recent studies have also linked PM exposure to chronic skin disorders, including atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne, and skin aging [26,27]. In addition, several natural products have been reported to reduce the harmful effects of PM exposure [28,29,30].
      PM-induced oxidative stress causes lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and DNA damage, leading to impaired cellular function and the initiation of inflammatory signaling pathways, such as AhR, NF-κB, and MAPK [31,32,33]. Given the growing prevalence of air pollution and its detrimental effects on skin health, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to mitigate PM-induced damage. Recent studies have identified targeting ROS and MAPK signaling pathways as a promising approach to preserve skin integrity and function under environmental stress [19,34,35].
      This study investigated the potential of XAN as a cosmetic ingredient to mitigate PM-induced skin damage. By leveraging its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, XAN may reduce oxidative stress, suppress inflammatory signaling, and prevent ECM degradation in PM-exposed skin cells. Our findings are expected to support the application of XAN in anti-pollution skincare formulations and contribute to the development of protective strategies in dermatological and cosmetic research.
    
    
      2. Results
      
        2.1. CXSE and XAN Mitigate PM-Induced Histological Changes and Suppress Inflammatory Cytokines in 3D-Reconstructed Skin
        Figure 1A demonstrates the three-dimensional structure of XAN. Prior to evaluating the protective effects of CXSE and XAN against PM-induced damage, we confirmed their cytocompatibility. MTT assay revealed that CXSE and XAN did not exhibit cytotoxicity and slightly enhanced cell proliferation at concentrations of up to 1 µg/mL or 1 µM, respectively (Figure S1). We investigated the protective effects of CXSE and XAN against PM-induced damage using a 3D-reconstructed skin model. Figure 1B presents a schematic overview of the experimental design. H&E staining revealed the histological structure and morphology of the stratum corneum. The PM-treated group exhibited significant damage in the stratum corneum compared to the control group. However, treatment with CXSE and XAN alleviated the morphological disruptions in the epidermis layer, with a more pronounced effect observed at the higher concentration (Figure 1C,D).
        To assess inflammatory responses, we measured the secretion of cytokines in 3D-reconstructed skin tissue. PM treatment was found to significantly increase the production of IL-6 and IL-8, whereas treatment with CXSE and XAN effectively reduced the levels of these cytokines (Figure 1E,F). These findings suggest that CXSE and XAN may help protect against PM-induced skin damage.
      
      
        2.2. CXSE and XAN Modulate the Expression of AhR and Attenuate Oxidative Responses After PM Exposure
        As shown in Figure 2A, a reduction in the expression of AhR was observed following treatment with PM and benzopyrene (BaP), a major polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and a component of PM. This finding suggests that these environmental toxins suppress the level of AhR or promote its degradation. In contrast, AhR expression in the resveratrol (Res)-treated group remained comparable to that in the control group, indicating that Res may prevent the suppression of AhR or exert a protective effect. Additionally, the elevated phospho-p38 levels in the PM- and BaP-treated groups highlighted the activation of stress or inflammatory pathways in response to environmental stress, further supporting the role of the p38 MAPK pathway in stress signaling.
        To further investigate the impact of PM on the AhR-mediated XRE binding activity, we used COS-7 cells, which are known for their high transfection efficiency (Figure S2A). In the Bap-treated groups (Figure S2B) and PM-treated groups (Figure S2C), CXSE and XAN were administered at two different concentrations to evaluate their inhibitory effects on AhR-mediated XRE binding activity. In HaCaT cells, PM exposure resulted in a reduction in AhR protein levels. However, treatment with CXSE following PM exposure restored the expression of AhR protein in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2B,C). PM binding to AhR led to its nuclear translocation and subsequent upregulation of the target gene CYP. However, when CXSE was administered at varying concentrations, a significant reduction in PM-induced CYP mRNA expression was observed (Figure 2D). A similar pattern was observed in the group treated with XAN (Figure 2E). These findings suggest that CXSE and XAN suppress PAH-induced oxidative stress by modulating AhR signaling.
        Next, ROS production was examined in PM-treated HaCaT keratinocyte cells to evaluate the inhibitory effects of CXSE and XAN on PM-induced oxidative stress. Compared to the control group, the PM-treated group showed increased ROS production. However, treatment with CXSE and XAN significantly reduced ROS levels (Figure 2F). ROS induces oxidative stress by damaging cellular components, including DNA, proteins, and lipids [36]. To counteract this damage, cells utilize various antioxidant enzymes, among which catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) play critical roles in antioxidant defense [37]. To investigate how cells respond to ROS and regulate antioxidant defense mechanisms under oxidative stress, we evaluated the mRNA expression levels of CAT, SOD, and GPx. The expression levels of the three antioxidant enzymes were effectively restored in the CXSE and XAN-treated groups at both concentrations following PM exposure when compared to the group exposed to PM alone. Notably, CXSE and XAN significantly restored catalase mRNA expression, suggesting a targeted regulatory effect (Figure 2G). These findings indicate that CXSE and XAN enhance endogenous antioxidant defenses and protect cells from PM-induced oxidative damage.
      
      
        2.3. CXSE and XAN Downregulate MAPK Pathway and Suppress MMP mRNA Expression in PM-Treated HaCaT Cells
        The MAPK signaling pathway is likely involved in mediating inflammation and regulating MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-13 expression. According to previous reports, MAPK signaling upregulates the expression of MMPs, which degrade ECM proteins, such as collagen, elastin, and proteoglycans [19]. MMP-mediated degradation of the ECM proteins compromises the structural integrity of the skin, eventually leading to wrinkle formation [38].
        To determine whether the MAPK signaling pathway contributes to regulating MMP expression at the protein level, we examined the phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38. PM treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of these kinases, indicating activation of the MAPK pathway. However, CXSE treatment markedly reduced their phosphorylation levels (Figure 3A). A similar reduction was observed in the XAN-treated group (Figure 3B), suggesting that both CXSE and XAN may inhibit MAPK pathway activation. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of CXSE and XAN on PM-induced MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-13 expressions. In the PM-treated control group, the expression of MMPs was significantly upregulated, suggesting that PM-induced inflammation contributed to this increase. However, treatment with high concentrations of CXSE and XAN markedly reduced the expression of MMPs at both the mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C–F). These findings confirm that PM exposure activates the MAPK signaling pathway, leading to increased MMP expression, while CXSE and XAN effectively counteract this response.
      
      
        2.4. CXSE and XAN Reduce Inflammatory Responses in PM-Treated Keratinocytes
        Previous studies have reported that MAPK activation triggers NF-κB, a key transcription factor that promotes the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-8, thereby contributing to inflammatory responses characterized by erythema and itching [34].
        To evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of CXSE and XAN, we examined the mRNA and protein expression levels, as well as the production of cytokines. We examined the expression patterns of two inflammatory factors, including NF-κB and COX-2, which regulate and propagate the inflammatory response (Figure 4A,B). PM treatment increased the mRNA expression of IL-6 and IL-8, whereas their expression levels were reduced in the CXSE- and XAN-treated groups (Figure 4C,D). This trend was also confirmed at the protein level, with reduced cytokine production in the CXSE- and XAN-treated groups (Figure 4E). These results suggest that CXSE and XAN effectively mitigate PM-induced inflammatory responses by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. This highlights the potential of CXSE and XAN as therapeutic agents for preventing or alleviating PM-induced skin inflammation and oxidative stress-related conditions.
      
    
    
      3. Discussion
      This study demonstrated the protective effects of CXSE and its major component, XAN, against PM-induced skin damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, and ECM degradation. PM exposure activated the MAPK signaling pathway, increased MMP expression, and elevated ROS levels, leading to histological damage and heightened cytokine production. However, CXSE and XAN inhibited MAPK activation, downregulated MMPs, restored the expression of antioxidant enzyme, and reduced IL-6 and IL-8 levels. Additionally, they prevented the PM-induced suppression of AhR, suggesting a role in maintaining skin homeostasis. Our results provide mechanistic insight into how CXSE and XAN modulate key signaling pathways and support their potential as active ingredients in anti-pollution skincare formulations.
      The skin serves as the primary barrier against environmental pollutants, such as PM, which cause oxidative stress, inflammation, and degradation of ECM [22]. Toxic constituents of PM, such as PAHs including fluoranthene, pyrene, and benzo[a]pyrene, activate AhR, which stimulates the cytochrome P450 enzyme family and subsequently increases ROS generation and inflammatory responses [39,40].
      A key finding of this study was the potent antioxidant activity exhibited by CXSE and XAN. PM exposure increased intracellular ROS production, which contributes significantly to oxidative skin damage. CXSE and XAN markedly reduced ROS levels and restored antioxidant enzyme expressions, including catalase, SOD, and GPx, indicating a robust protective mechanism against oxidative stress.
      AhR signaling represents another critical pathway implicated in PM-induced skin damage. PM exposure results in enhanced nuclear translocation of AhR and the upregulated expression of CYP1A1, which is a hallmark of PAH metabolism [23]. Treatment with CXSE and XAN prevents AhR nuclear translocation, thus reducing downstream CYP1A1 gene expression. These results suggest that CXSE and XAN interfere with the binding of PAHs to AhR, modulating the signaling cascade crucial for reducing oxidative damage and inflammation.
      Moreover, PM-induced ROS generation also activates the MAPK signaling pathway, a critical mediator of inflammatory and stress responses that triggers NF-κB activation and promotes ECM degradation through enhanced MMP expression [34,41,42]. Our results show that CXSE and XAN effectively suppress MAPK activation, inhibit NF-κB activation, and reduce the expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, and MMP-13. These effects collectively indicate a powerful anti-inflammatory response and the preservation of ECM integrity.
      Inflammatory mediators, notably IL-6 and IL-8, were significantly elevated upon PM exposure. CXSE and XAN effectively reduced the secretion of these cytokines, which is consistent with earlier observations demonstrating XAN’s inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, in RAW 264.7 cells [6], as well as CXSE’s cytokine reduction in obese mice [43]. Thus, CXSE and XAN exhibit potent anti-inflammatory properties by targeting the upstream signaling pathways involved in cytokine production.
      In terms of clinical application, these findings strongly suggest the utility of CXSE and XAN in skincare formulations aimed at mitigating PM-induced premature skin aging, irritation, and collagen degradation. The preservation of collagen integrity through MMP inhibition further underscores the therapeutic potential of these compounds in maintaining skin elasticity and preventing wrinkle formation [38].
      While our results provide substantial in vitro evidence supporting the protective effects of CXSE and XAN against PM-induced skin damage, some limitations exist. The complexity of human skin responses might not be fully captured by our in vitro models. Therefore, future studies involving in vivo validation or clinical trials are crucial to confirm the efficacy, bioavailability, and long-term safety of these compounds. Additionally, further research is required to elucidate the precise molecular interactions of CXSE and XAN with AhR and MAPK pathways using targeted inhibition approaches. Finally, formulation stability and potential cytotoxicity assessments should be conducted to optimize their practical application in commercial skincare products.

        4.1. Preparation of CXSE and XAN
        CXSE was prepared following previously established methods [44]. Briefly, C. xanthorrhiza rhizomes were obtained from Cosmax NBT (Seoul, Republic of Korea) and extracted using a supercritical CO2 fluid extraction system (SCFE-P400, Ilshin Autoclave Co., Ltd., Daejeon, Republic of Korea) [45]. The ground rhizomes were loaded into a high-pressure vessel maintained at 50 °C. CO2 was introduced at 3.2 L/min and 40 MPa. The extraction yielded CXSE at 8.0% (w/w) [46,47], with XAN comprising 30.0% (w/w) of the extract. XAN was further isolated as previously described [43].
      
      
        4.2. Preparation of Fine Particulate Matter Samples
        Standard Reference Material (SRM 2786, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) with a mean particle diameter less than 4 μm was used as the PM source [48]. SRM2786 was suspended in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS; Dynebio, Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea) at 10 mg/mL and sonicated for 1 h before treatment to prevent particle aggregation.
      
      
        4.3. Cell Culture
        HaCaT (human keratinocytes) and COS-7 (monkey kidney fibroblast) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in DMEM (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), 1% penicillin, and 1% streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For the experiments, cells were seeded and treated with CXSE or XAN in the presence of 100 µg/mL of PM.

After 4 h, cells were incubated in DMEM with 10% FBS for 24 h. Cells were then treated with CXSE or XAN in the presence of 100 µg/mL of PM for 24 h, which were lysed with NP-40 buffer (Elpis Biotech, Daejeon, Republic of Korea), and luciferase activity was measured using a MicroLumatPlus luminometer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany).
      
      
        4.5. Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
        Total RNA was isolated from HaCaT cells using TRIzol reagent (Takara, Shiga, Japan). RNA concentration was quantified spectrophotometrically with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase premix (Elpis Biotech) according to the standard protocol. The cDNA was amplified with Taq PCR PreMix (CellSafe, Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea) and specific primers (Bioneer, Daejeon, Republic of Korea), as listed in Table 1. PCR products were resolved on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized using a G: BOX EF imaging system (Syngene, Cambridge, UK) and the GeneSys 1.8.0 software program.
      
      
        4.6. Western Blot Analysis
        Cells were lysed with NP-40 buffer (Elpis Biotech) containing protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk and probed overnight with primary antibodies (1:1000) against NF-κB; AhR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA); tumor protein p53 (p53); cytochrome c; cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2); p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK); p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK); p-p38; ERK; JNK; p38; α-tubulin (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA); and MMP-1 (Bioworld, Dublin, OH, USA). After incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX, USA), signals were detected using ECL solution (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) and captured with a G: BOX EF imaging system (Syngene).
      
      
        4.7. Measurement of ROS
        ROS production was measured using 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). Cells were treated with CXSE or XAN and 100 µg/mL of PM for 24 h. After staining with 10 µM of H2DCFDA for 30 min, cells were lysed and centrifuged. Supernatants were analyzed at 485 nm excitation and 530 nm emission using a SpectraMax Gemini EM reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
      
      
        4.8. 3D-Reconstructed Human Skin Model Culture
        Neoderm-E (Tegoscience, Seoul, Republic of Korea) was used as a 3D-reconstructed human skin model. Tissues were maintained in a maintenance medium (Tegoscience) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The skin tissues were treated daily with CXSE or XAN in the presence of 100 µg/mL of PM for three consecutive days (with daily medium changes).
      
      
        4.9. Histological Analysis
        Tissues were fixed in 10% formalin (Junsei Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), embedded in paraffin, and then sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Sections were observed under a light microscope (CK40; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an eXcope T500 camera (DIXI Science, Daejeon, Republic of Korea).
      
      
        4.10. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)
        Concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 in a conditioned medium from HaCaT cells and 3D-reconstructed human skin tissues were measured using commercial human ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices).
      
      
        4.11. Statistical Analysis
        All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the results were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, USA). Group differences were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan’s post hoc test. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, # p < 0.05, and ## p < 0.01.
      
    
    
      5. Conclusions
      In this study, we demonstrated that CXSE and its major component, XAN, effectively protect skin cells from PM-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and ECM degradation. CXSE and XAN reduced ROS production, restored antioxidant enzyme expression, and inhibited the activation of AhR and MAPK signaling pathways. These treatments also downregulated pro-inflammatory mediators and MMPs, preserving the structural and functional integrity of the skin. The protective effects were confirmed in both HaCaT cells and a 3D-reconstructed human skin model, highlighting their relevance for topical application. Taken together, our findings support the potential use of CXSE and XAN as bioactive ingredients in anti-pollution skincare products aimed at preventing or mitigating PM-induced skin damage.

Title: Considerations Regarding the Cytotoxicity of Certain Classes of Fungal Polyketides—Potential Raw Materials for Skincare Products for Healthy and Diseased Skin

Abstract: Background: This study investigates the cytotoxicity of microbial polyketides biosynthesized by Monascus species through both in silico and in vitro approaches. Methods: Six main know Monascus-derived polyketides were analysed in silico an an vitro. Results: In silico tests reveal that the main derived compounds exhibit lipophilic properties, indicating their potential suitability as active ingredients in dermato-cosmetic formulations. In silico tests revealed significant flexibility and high degrees of unsaturation for some Monascus-derived polyketides, suggesting a broad interaction potential and a propensity for chemical instability. In silico permeability tests indicated low epidermal penetration. Cytotoxicity assays conducted in vitro on a HaCaT cell line revealed varying levels of cytotoxicity among the three classes of fungal polyketides. Yellow polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber exhibited moderate cytotoxicity, while orange polyketides derived from the same strains showed low cytotoxicity. Red, orange, and yellow polyketides derived from a high-productive Monascus sp. genus showed low or negligible cytotoxicity. After 48 h of exposure, the cytotoxic profiles of all Monascus polyketides remained relatively stable. The IC50 values obtained through linear or nonlinear models supplied by EXCEL MS Office or for the Systat programme indicated moderate-to-low cytotoxicity for polyketides derived from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus. The bioproducts derived from high-productive Monascus sp. exhibited weak or negligible cytotoxicity. Conclusions: The results obtained suggest that the Monascus-derived polyketides possess promising properties for therapeutic and cosmetic applications, but their chemical stability must be considered in the case of dermatological formulations.

Body: 1. Introduction
      The coloured polyketides produced by fungal microorganisms of the Monascus genus are widely used in Asia within the food industry to colour products such as yoghurt, cheese, sweets, and ice cream [1,2,3,4]. Studies conducted to date have shown that polyketides biosynthesized by Monascus species exhibit antioxidant [5,6,7,8], antiproliferative, antibacterial, and antifungal activities [9,10,11,12,13], making them interesting for potential dermato-cosmetic applications. These bioproducts are often used in Asia as dietary supplements with hypocholesterolaemic effects [1,14], although further studies are needed to assess their safety in patients with health conditions, due to the presence of mycotoxins, the non-standardised content of monacolins [15,16,17,18], and the presence of polyketides [13]. An interesting approach relates to the use of these compounds in dermato-cosmetic formulations. Over time, microbial polyketides derived from Monascus species have been the subject of various patents and scientific publications. For example, a Korean patent [19] describes cosmetic biopreparations with antioxidant and anti-ageing effects containing oils fermented with Monascus sp. The raw material is obtained by fermenting plant seeds (jojoba, Camellia, green tea, macadamia, and sunflower seeds) or dried fruits (dried olives) with Monascus species. After fermentation, the fermented seeds or fruits are steam-sterilised and then pressed to obtain oil. The resulting oils are used as raw materials in the development of dermato-cosmetic products for skincare [19].
      Another patent, granted to L’Oréal Paris, France [20], describes dermato-cosmetic bioproducts with tanning effects that contain polyketides obtained through solid-state biosynthesis (biosynthesis on solid substrate), using various Monascus species. The polyketides described in this patent are obtained by selective extraction with organic solvents and then are spray-dried in the presence of maltodextrin (4 parts Monascus to 96 parts maltodextrin). The resulting bioproducts are used as a raw material in the formulation of various dermato-cosmetic products with tanning properties. Koli and collaborators [21], in the studies carried out with red and yellow polyketides biosynthesised by Monascus sp., demonstrated that when these compounds are added to dermato-cosmetic formulations at concentrations ranging from 4% to 8%, they enhance their photoprotective properties (Figure 1a,b).
      Jin and Pyo, in the studies made with soybean extracts fermented with Monascus, reported that these bioproducts inhibit elastase and collagenase enzymes involved in collagen and elastin degradation in the skin (Figure 2a–c). These properties recommend Monascus-derived polyketides as potential raw materials for dermato-cosmetic bioproducts with anti-ageing effects [22]. In vitro tests performed by Wu and collaborators [23] on a murine melanoma cell line and a human keratinocyte cell line type, HaCaT, with two compounds (Monascuspirolide and Ergosterol peroxide) isolated from an alcoholic extract of Monascus-fermented rice showed that these compounds: (1) do not affect keratinocyte viability (Figure 3a); (2) protect keratinocytes from UV-B radiation (Figure 3b); (3) reduce the reactive oxygen species (Figure 3c); and (4) exhibit anti-melanogenic properties (Figure 3d) [22]. Additionally, soybean extracts fermented with Monascus showed significant free radical-scavenging activity (DPPH and ABTS tests), protecting HaCat cells from oxidative stress. These extracts inhibit enzymes involved in skin ageing, such as elastase and collagenase, a property that supports their use as raw materials in anti-ageing dermato-cosmetic formulations [23]. The coloured polyketides of interest for such formulations include monascorubramine, monascorubrin, rubropunctamine, rubropunctatin, monascin, and ankaflavin, though Monascus species produce many more coloured polyketides (Figure 4a–c). Notably, orange polyketides (Figure 4b) are important because they are biosynthesized first. The orange polyketides (two structures presented in the Figure 4b) may be reduced to yellow polyketides [22,24] with chemical structures presented in the Figure 4a, or can be turned into red–purple polyketides in the presence of the primary amines (chemical reactions presented in the Figure 4c) [24].
      The recent in silico studies conducted by Albișoru and colleagues [13] have shown that six of the polyketides synthesised by Monascus sp. possess antimicrobial properties but exhibit hepatic and neurological toxicity, making bioproducts containing them more suitable for topical formulations [13]. In this context, the studies aimed to achieve the following objectives:In silico prediction of the properties of six of the most well-known polyketides biosynthesized by Monascus, and an evaluation of their dermal and oral absorption capacity;In vitro evaluation of the effect of bioproducts containing yellow and orange polyketides on the viability of standardised HaCaT cell lines;Evaluation of the IC50 value (the concentration at which a substance exerts half of its maximum effect) based on in vitro data, using linear and nonlinear models supplied by the SYSTAT version 13.2, (Inpixon, Palo Alto, CA, USA) or ATT Bioquest programme version 1.0.0, (Pleasanton, CA, USA);Evaluation of the cytotoxicity of three types of bioproducts enriched with coloured polyketides, derived from Monascus purpureus, Monascus ruber, and a high-productive Monascus sp.
    
    
      2. Materials and Methods
      
        2.1. Bioproducts Obtaining
        The polyketides used in this study were biosynthesised by three Monascus species, as follows: Monascus purpureus DSM 1379 (MP), Monascus ruber MUCL 28,962 (MR), and a high-yielding Monascus species (MM), the latter having been received as a gift from Prof. Octavian Duliu of the Institute of Atomic Physics, Măgurele, Romania [13].
        Three classes of coloured polyketides were obtained according to the methodology reported by Albisoru and collaborators [13], via solid-state biosynthesis, from each Monascus strain and Oryza sativa as a solid substrate. These three classes, including six well-known polyketides (namely monascorubrin, monascorubramine, rubropunctatin, rubropunctamine, monascin, and ankaflavin) were produced by each strain, their presence confirmed by LC-MS TOF in our previous work [13]. The difference between each bioproduct lies in the fact that the crude extract obtained from solid-state biosynthesis with MM contains a higher quantity of coloured polyketides compared with the bioproducts resulting from biosynthesis with MR or MP strains. The three classes of coloured Monascus polyketides (red, orange, and yellow polyketides) were obtained from the bioproduct resulting from solid-state biosynthesis, by extraction with selective solvents, using the methodology presented in [13]. In this study, we used the crude polyketides dissolved in an equal volume of dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) [13].
      
      
        2.2. In Silico Studies
        The degree of toxicity was assessed taking into account the value of IC50 and levels indicated by NIEHS-US and other reports [25,26,27,28,29,30,31] from the tests performed in vitro on cell lines. The radar maps and the boiled egg-type diagram regarding the bioavailability of the six main know Monascus polyketides previously identified [13] in the analysed bioproducts were generated using the Swiss ADME programme. The data regarding the skin permeability for the six Monascus-derived polyketides were obtained from pharmacokinetic parameters predicted in silico by the same Swiss ADME programme.
      
      
        2.3. In Vitro Studies
        Cytotoxicity tests were conducted on a standardized HaCaT cell line, obtained from Cell Line Service GmbH (cat. no. 330493, Eppenheim, Germany), using the methodology reported by Bostan et al. [25]. The human immortalized keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, was provided by Cell Line Service GmbH (Cat no. 330493, Eppelheim, Germany) and was grown and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 10% foetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics (10,000 μg/mL streptomycin and 10,000 units/mL penicillin) at 30 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were serially passaged at 70–80% confluence. When performing treatments, HaCaT cells were grown to 70–80% confluence after 24 h. Cytotoxicity data for red polyketides are available in our previously published paper (Albisoru et al. 2025, accepted, in press [32]) and for this reason are not presented in detail in this manuscript. All measurements were performed in triplicate, and the results are expressed as average values with corresponding standard deviations (STDEVs). The exclusion of the positive control at this stage was motivated by the initial screening nature of the test, in which the validation of the method was achieved through the predictable behaviour of the negative control and standard cell culture parameters. In subsequent stages, validated positive controls will be included to calibrate the biological response. In this stage, all results were compared with a negative control (untreated cells). The tests performed with the solvent used (DMSO), at the corresponding dilutions, did not show any influence on the HaCaT cell line.
      
      
        2.4. IC50 Evaluation
        The data obtained from the in vitro tests were used to evaluate the IC50 value, employing linear methods provided by Excel Office 2021 and nonlinear models supplied by the SYSTAT version 13.2, (Inpixon, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and/or ATT BioQuest model version 1.0.0 [27] (AAT Bioquest, Inc. (Pleasanton, CA, USA)). The initial concentrations of the crude polyketides in DMSO used in this study were as follows: Monascus purpureus (MP)-derived yellow polyketides: 125.33 mg/L; Monascus ruber (MR)-derived yellow polyketides: 32.59 mgL mg/L; Monascus high-productive (MM)-derived yellow polyketides: 695.25 mg/L; MP-derived orange polyketides: 1600 mg/L; MR-derived orange polyketides: 400 mgL mg/L; and MM-derived orange polyketides: 4800 mg/L [13]. All bioproducts were tested using the same volumetric concentration range (0–100 µL/mL). The end concentration of ethanol in cell culture media was less than 0.1%. The values of IC50 obtained are reported in µg/mL, taking into account the crude bioproduct concentration of each solution tested. The value of IC50 was assessed with linear models supplied by EXCEL MS Office, nonlinear models supplied by SYSTAT, and a nonlinear model of AAT Bioquest. Mathematical predictions generated by the SYSTAT programme were selected based on the value of the R2 coefficient. Only values of R2 > 0.81 were considered to indicate a good correlation between the mathematical model and the experimental data. In the nonlinear model used by ATT BioQuest, three cytotoxicity values obtained from in vitro tests on the HaCaT cell line were used for each concentration. Based on these values, the ATT BioQuest model generated the IC50 values, after function (1), presented below, without generating any additional statistical parameters.(1)Y=Min+Max−Min1+(XIC50)Hill coefficient
        Microsoft Excel was used to calculate the standard deviations of these average values, which were also presented as error bars in the graphical representations of the original data obtained in vitro.
      
    
    
      3. Results
      
        3.1. In Silico Studies
        After analysing the data obtained in silico (Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7) for six of the most well-known microbial polyketides biosynthesized by Monascus species [13], the following observations can be made:The six analysed molecules exhibit a pronounced lipophilic character (Figure 5); the partition coefficients between octanol and water (WlogPo/w) for the six derived Monascus polyketides are in the range of (3 ÷ 4) [13]. As a result, these polyketides have a greater affinity for the lipid phase than the aqueous phase, which presents them as potential excipients or valuable active ingredients for dermato-cosmetic formulations, a fact also confirmed by the other scientists [19,20,21,22,23];Ankaflavin, monascorubramine, and monascorubrin are molecules with high molecular flexibility (Figure 5), which gives them the ability to interact with a wide range of biological targets. These data are supported by their antioxidant and antitumor effects [4,6,10,12,14];The polyketides rubropunctatin, rubropunctamine, monascorubramine, and monascorubrin are molecules with a high degree of unsaturation (Figure 5), which provides them with a high level of chemical instability. This characteristic may limit their use in topical pharmaceutical formulations due to the possibility of rapid degradation or undesirable interactions with other compounds in the formulation.Given that in silico tests indicated a potential for increased cytotoxicity, the analysis of the permeability coefficients (logKp), determined in silico by Albișoru and collaborators [13], shows that they fall within the range of [−5 ÷ −7] (Figure 6). These values suggest the low permeation of these molecules through skin layers [33,34]. In general, the six polyketides have a low capacity to pass through skin layers, with monascin and rubropunctatin exhibiting negligible permeation (logKp < −6); The “boiled egg” diagrams [35], generated in silico (Figure 7), indicate that the six analysed polyketides are not substrates for P-glycoprotein (PGP), suggesting that they are not easily eliminated from cells. The analysed molecules are easily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with most of them having the ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, except for rubropunctamine.
      
      
        3.2. In Vitro Studies
        The cytotoxicity tests performed in vitro on HaCaT cell lines showed the following:(a)When the cell line is exposed for 24 h to yellow polyketides biosynthesised by the three Monascus species, the viability measured is greater than 71% in all three cases (Figure 8a–c). The use of linear models for evaluating the IC50 parameter shows that the yellow polyketides isolated from biopreparations derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber are cytotoxic (IC50 < 20 μg/mL). The yellow polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp. exhibit weak cytotoxicity (IC50 = 144.45 μg/mL). The evaluation of the IC50 parameter with nonlinear models provided by Microsoft SYSTAT version 13.2 (Figure 9a–c) shows that the yellow polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber (Figure 9a,b) exhibit moderate cytotoxicity (IC50 = 46.45 μg/mL and 31.29 μg/mL, respectively). In contrast, the IC50 value obtained for the yellow polyketides derived from highly productive Monascus sp. indicates weak cytotoxicity (IC50 = 660.49 μg/mL) (Figure 9c).
        
          
            (b)
            If the exposure time is increased to 48 h, the linear models for evaluating the IC50 parameter (Figure 10a–c) show that the yellow polyketides derived from Monascus ruber retain their cytotoxic character (IC50 = 16.10 μg/mL) (Figure 10b). However, the yellow polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and highly productive Monascus sp. exhibit weak cytotoxicity (IC50 = 175.85 μg/mL and IC50 = 150.86 μg/mL, respectively) (Figure 10a,c). Math modelling with the Systat programme confirms the in vitro results (Figure 11a–c), indicating that the yellow polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber exhibit moderate cytotoxicity (IC50 = 25.73 μg/mL and 29.33 μg/mL, respectively) (Figure 10a,b). The data obtained for yellow polyketides derived from highly productive Monascus sp. show that they have low cytotoxicity (IC50 = 232.91 μg/mL) (Figure 11c).
          
        
        Following the exposure of the HaCaT cell line to orange polyketides for 24 h, the IC50 values obtained with linear models (Figure 12a–c) show that the polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber have low cytotoxicity (IC50 = 218.39 μg/mL and IC50 = 257.59 μg/mL, respectively) (Figure 12a). In the case of orange polyketides derived from highly productive Monascus sp., the IC50 value (IC50 = 1487.24 μg/mL) shows that these are non-cytotoxic.
        The use of nonlinear models provided by the Systat programme to evaluate IC50 (Figure 13a,b), indicates that the orange polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber exhibit low cytotoxicity (IC50 = 323.2 μg/mL and IC50 = 384 μg/mL, respectively) (Figure 13a,b). In the case of orange polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., predictions made with the Systat programme show that these are non-cytotoxic (Figure 13c), with an IC50 of 4704 μg/mL.
        If the exposure time is extended to 48 h, the results obtained for IC50 with linear math models (Figure 14a–c) show that the bioproducts containing orange polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber (Figure 14a,b) exhibit low cytotoxicity (IC50 = 225.73 μg/mL and IC50 = 198.27 μg/mL, respectively). For orange polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., the evaluation of the IC50 parameter with a linear model shows that they exhibit low cytotoxicity (IC50 = 45.59 μg/mL) (Figure 14c). Predictions made with the Systat model (Figure 15a–c) indicate that in the case the polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber (Figure 15a,b), cytotoxicity is low (IC50 = 305.6 μg/mL and IC50 = 226 μg/mL, respectively). Predicted value of IC50 for orange polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp. (Figure 15c) show that these are non-cytotoxic (IC50 = 3120 μg/mL).
        The IC50 values obtained with linear models provided by Microsoft Office, after 24 h of exposure of the cell line to the studied polyketides (Figure 16a), reveal the following:(1)The yellow polyketides derived from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus (Figure 16a) exhibit high cytotoxicity. In contrast, the red polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber show moderate cytotoxicity (20 μg/mL < IC50 < 100 μg/mL). The yellow and red polyketides derived from high-productivity Monascus sp., as well as the orange polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber, exhibit low cytotoxicity. Orange polyketides derived from high-productivity Monascus sp. show no cytotoxicity (Figure 16a and Table 1).(2)The data obtained after 48 h of exposure show that the yellow polyketides derived from Monascus ruber (Figure 16b, Table 1) exhibit high cytotoxicity. The red polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber exhibit moderate cytotoxicity. The orange polyketides derived from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus, the yellow polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and from high-productivity Monascus sp., as well as the red polyketides derived from high-productivity Monascus sp. (Figure 16b, Table 1) exhibit low cytotoxicity (100 μg/mL < IC50 < 1000 μg/mL). The orange polyketides derived from high-productivity Monascus sp. are non-cytotoxic (IC50 > 1000 μg/mL).
        The IC50 values obtained with nonlinear models provided by the SYSTAT program, after 24 h of exposure of the cell line to the studied polyketides (Figure 17a), reveal the following:The red polyketides derived from Monascus ruber and the yellow polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber (Figure 17a) show moderate cytotoxicity. The other polyketides show low cytotoxicity, except for the orange and red polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., which are non-cytotoxic (IC50 > 1000 μg/mL);The data obtained after 48 h of exposure show that the yellow polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber, as well as the red polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus (Figure 17b, Table 1), exhibit moderate cytotoxicity (20 μg/mL < IC50 < 100 μg/mL). The orange polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber, as well as the yellow polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp. (Figure 17b), exhibit low cytotoxicity (100 μg/mL < IC50 < 1000 μg/mL). The orange polyketides and the red polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., and the red polyketides derived from Monascus ruber, are non-cytotoxic (IC50 > 1000 μg/mL).
        The application of the ATT BioQuest model for obtaining the IC50 values after 24 h of exposure (Figure 18a and Table 1) shows that most of the studied bioproducts exhibit very high cytotoxicity (IC50 < 10 μg/mL) or high cytotoxicity (IC50 < 20 μg/mL. The red polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus exhibit moderate cytotoxicity (20 μg/mL < IC50 < 100 μg/mL); the red and yellow polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp. exhibit low cytotoxicity (100 μg/mL < IC50 < 1000 μg/mL) (Figure 18a). The application of the same model for the in vitro data obtained after 48 h of exposure (Figure 18b and Table 1) indicates that the orange polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus have low cytotoxicity (100 μg/mL < IC50 < 1000 μg/mL). The red polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and the orange polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus species exhibit moderate cytotoxicity (20 μg/mL < IC50 < 100 μg/mL). The remaining bioproducts exhibit high cytotoxicity (red polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp.,) or very high cytotoxicity (bioproducts containing yellow polyketides derived from all Monascus species studied, and bioproducts containing red and orange polyketides derived from Monascus ruber), for which the IC50 < 10 μg/mL (Figure 18b and Table 1).
      
    
    
      4. Discussions
      Analysis performed in silico for six microbial polyketides biosynthesized by Monascus species reveals that the polyketides show pronounced lipophilicity (WlogPo/w (3 ÷ 4)), making them promising materials for dermato-cosmetic formulations [13,19,20,21,22,23]. Ankaflavin, monascorubramine, and monascorubrin exhibit high molecular flexibility, which supports their antioxidant and antitumor properties [4,6,10,12,14]. Rubropunctatin, rubropunctamine, monascorubramine, and monascorubrin, due to their high degree of unsaturation, are chemically unstable, limiting their use in topical formulations due to potential degradation or adverse interactions. Various strategies, including spray drying, freeze drying, incorporation into liposomes or in the core–shell structures [5], and chemical derivatisation, can be used to enhance the stability and functionality of Monascus polyketides [5,37,38]. Long et al. incorporated red polyketides derived from Monascus sp. (highly unstable pigments) into liposomes to improve their stability and biological activity. Unilamellar, spherical liposomes with diameters ranging from 20 to 200 nm were obtained using the ultrasound-assisted thin film method. The resulting nanomaterials exhibited increased stability to variations in pH, temperature, light, and the presence of metal ions, compared to the unencapsulated red polyketides [37]. Xu and collaborators improved the stability of Monascus orange polyketides (also highly unstable pigments) by derivatising them with a soy protein. The resulting products were used to prepare microgels, which showed 20% greater stability to variations in temperature, pH, and light compared to the initial orange polyketides [38]. The molecules show a low capacity to pass through skin layers (logKp = (−5 ÷ −7)), monascin and rubropunctatin having negligible permeation [33,34]. The tests performed in silico by Albisoru et al. [13] demonstrated that the Monascus-derived polyketides exhibit toxicity when administered orally. However, these molecules display a low capacity to penetrate the skin barrier. Their use in dermato-cosmetic applications is justified by the minimal systemic absorption at the cutaneous level, which limits the body’s exposure to toxic concentrations. At the local level, on the surface of the epidermis, Monascus-derived polyketides may exhibit several beneficial effects, such as (a) protection of the skin against oxidative stress and ageing, due to their antioxidant and anti-ageing properties [12,13]; (b) stimulation of skin regeneration and hydration through the genic modulation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts [5,6,7,9,22,23]; (c) potential use as active ingredients in bioproducts for acne-prone skin, due to their antimicrobial activity [13]; and (d) use as active compounds in the formulation of dermato-cosmetic bioproducts for skin photoprotection [21,23]. The “boiled egg” diagrams indicate that the studied polyketides are not P-glycoprotein substrates, suggesting easy absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and the potential to cross the blood–brain barrier, except for rubropunctamine. All of these indicate that the bioproducts that contain Monascus-derived polyketides are safer if they are used in topical formulations for skincare protection [35,36]. The same considerations are valid for the spent biomass of Monascus, which can contain traces of these compounds, when it is used for agricultural or environmental protection applications [39,40]. A comparative analysis of the data (excluding the results obtained using ATT Bioquest), presented in Table 1, reveals that both linear and nonlinear models provided by SYSTAT software yield similar results at evaluating in vitro cytotoxicity. After 24 h of exposure, the red polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp. exhibited low cytotoxicity or were non-cytotoxic [26,28,29,30,41]. The yellow polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp. showed low cytotoxicity in both models, while the orange polyketides from the same strain were non-cytotoxic, according to data from both approaches (Table 1). Following 48 h of exposure, the linear model indicated low cytotoxicity for the red polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., whereas the nonlinear model suggested that the bioproducts are practically non-cytotoxic. For the orange polyketides derived from the same strain, the linear model yielded an IC50 = 845.59 μg/mL, corresponding to low cytotoxicity, while the nonlinear modelling performed with SYSTAT presented IC50 = 3120 μg/mL, categorising these bioproducts as non-cytotoxic.
      Regarding the yellow polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., both math models indicated that the bioproduct exhibits low cytotoxicity. Overall, the information generated by the two mathematical approaches was significantly more consistent compared to the IC50 values obtained with ATT Bioquest software.
      This discrepancy arises because the ATT BioQuest model was designed for cases where the biological effect is driven by a single compound or by a very well-defined interaction between the compounds and the biological target. In complex mixtures, where multiple compounds may contribute differently to the overall effect (through synergy, antagonism, or additivity), the BioQuest model can either underestimate or overestimate the IC50 value [42,43,44].
      In the present case, the in vitro tested bioproducts contain only one class of coloured polyketides (yellow or orange or red polyketides), as well as other colourless compounds biosynthesised by Monascus, such as monacolines, which are found in bioproducts that contain orange or red polyketides obtained by extraction with selective solvents [45,46,47]. For bioproducts with complex compositions, flexible nonlinear models, such as those provided by MS Office or SYSTAT, with customisable settings, are more appropriate than the model supplied by ATT BioQuest for an accurate estimation of IC50 values and the assessment of cytotoxicity.
      Taking into consideration the cytotoxicity limits used in the case of the tests performed in vitro [28,29,30,31,32], the use of linear models for the IC50 estimation, after 24 h of exposure, shows the following: yellow polyketides isolated from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus exhibit high cytotoxicity, but the red polyketides isolated from the same strains show moderate cytotoxicity. The remaining bioproducts, including polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., exhibit low cytotoxicity, except for the orange polyketides derived from the same strain, which do not exhibit cytotoxicity.
      At an exposure time of 48 h, the IC50 values estimated with linear models show the following: the yellow polyketides derived from Monascus ruber exhibit high cytotoxicity; the red polyketides derived from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus exhibit moderate cytotoxicity; the remaining bioproducts, including polyketides derived from highly productive Monascus sp., show low cytotoxicity.
      The IC50 values obtained with nonlinear models provided by the SYSTAT programme, for an exposure time of 24 h, reveal that the red polyketides derived from Monascus ruber and yellow polyketides derived from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus exhibit moderate cytotoxicity; the main bioproducts, including yellow and red polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., exhibit low cytotoxicity. The orange and red polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp. do not exhibit cytotoxicity.
      After 48 h of exposure, the IC50 values obtained with SYSTAT models indicate the following: the yellow polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber, as well as red polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus, exhibit moderate cytotoxicity; the orange polyketides derived from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus, along with yellow polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., exhibit low cytotoxicity; and the red and orange polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp. do not exhibit cytotoxicity.
      The IC50 values obtained with the nonlinear model provided by the ATT BioQuest model indicate the following: after HaCat cell line exposure for 24 h to Monascus-derived polyketides, the main bioproducts, including orange polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., exhibit high cytotoxicity; the red polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus show moderate cytotoxicity; and the yellow and red polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp. exhibit low cytotoxicity.
      At an exposure time of 48 h, the IC50 values obtained using the ATT BioQuest model show the following: the main bioproducts, including red and yellow polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., exhibit high cytotoxicity; the orange polyketides derived from high-productivity Monascus sp., as well the red polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus exhibit moderate cytotoxicity; and the orange polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus exhibit low cytotoxicity.
      Regarding the cytotoxic properties of Monascus-derived polyketides, the studies on their photoprotective and antiproliferative effects are significant, particularly concerning skin health and protection issues. These effects are important for preventing tumorigenesis (melanoma) and protecting the skin from UV damage, suggesting the potential use of these compounds in skincare and melanoma therapies [23,47,48,49,50]. Wu et al. [48], in the studies performed on polyketides derived from Monascus sp., demonstrated their photoprotective and antiproliferative effects on a melanoma cell line. The bioproducts containing these polyketides protect skin cells from UV damage and reduce melanin production. The results suggest that these bioproducts could be an alternative for treating hyperpigmentation and sunburn [47]. Musso et al. [49], in the studies performed on natural or derivatised polyketides, showed their potential as scaffolds for creating Hsp90 inhibitors. From this point of view, the fungal polyketides offer a new approach to melanoma treatment by inhibiting Hsp90, disrupting tumour cell growth and survival. In the same view, Tan et al. [50] highlighted the ability of yellow polyketides from Monascus sp. to inhibit melanoma tumour cell growth, suggesting their potential for antitumor therapies.
      The analysis performed in silico of six Monascus-derived polyketides shows that these compounds exhibit poor transdermal penetration, as indicated by low skin-permeability values, monascin and rubropunctatin displaying negligible permeation. This limited capacity to penetrate the skin barrier represents particular significance when evaluating their in vitro cytotoxicity. While certain polyketides (notably yellow and red pigments from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus) exhibit moderate to high cytotoxicity in vitro, depending on the exposure time and the modelling method employed, their minimal skin absorption suggests a reduced risk of systemic toxicity upon topical application. In particular, polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., which exhibit low or negligible cytotoxicity after (24–48) hours of exposure, appear to be suitable for dermato-cosmetic applications.
      The absence of P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux and the inability to cross the skin barrier reinforce the notion that these compounds exert their biological effects primarily at the epidermal level, reducing potential harm to underlying tissues or systemic circulation. The low skin permeation of the Monascus-derived polyketides serves as a protective factor, mitigating the cytotoxic potential identified in vitro and in silico, supporting the inclusion of these in topical bioproducts with antioxidant, anti-ageing, antimicrobial, and photoprotective properties.
      Regarding the benefits and risks associated with Monascus-derived polyketides’ use in dermato-cosmetic applications at this moment, we can make the following suggestions:(1)Polyketides biosynthesised by Monascus species are attracting increasing interest in dermato-cosmetic formulations, due to their wide spectrum of biological activities and natural origin. In silico and in vitro analyses reveal that these compounds, particularly red, orange, and yellow pigments, possess promising features suitable for topical formulations. However, their application must be carefully balanced with their chemical and biological limitations.(2)From a functional point of view, Monascus-derived polyketides demonstrate multiple dermatological benefits. Compounds such as ankaflavin, monascorubramine, and monascorubrin exhibit high molecular flexibility, which supports potent antioxidant activity, contributing to skin protection against oxidative stress and premature ageing. These polyketides modulate genic expression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, suggesting their potential to stimulate skin regeneration, improve hydration, and support tissue repair. Moreover, these polyketides exhibit antimicrobial properties, making them suitable candidates for formulations targeting acne-prone skin. The photoprotective and antiproliferative effects of these polyketides, especially for melanoma cell lines, highlight their capacity to protect the skin from ultraviolet radiation and reduce melanin synthesis. These features make Monascus-derived polyketides promising ingredients for formulations designed to address skin hyperpigmentation and UV-induced damage.(3)A significant safety advantage of these compounds lies in their poor transdermal penetration. In silico predictions indicate very low skin permeability, with logKp values ranging from –5 to –7, and negligible permeation reported for compounds such as monascin and rubropunctatin. This limited ability to cross the skin barrier significantly reduces systemic exposure and toxicity, even for compounds that display moderate-to-high cytotoxicity in vitro.(4)Additionally, predictions based on the “boiled egg” model suggest that these compounds are not substrates for P-glycoprotein, indicating a low likelihood of efflux-related bioaccumulation in skin cells.
      Nevertheless, several limitations must be addressed to enable the safe and effective inclusion of Monascus polyketides in dermato-cosmetic formulations. Red and orange pigments—such as rubropunctatin, rubropunctamine, and monascorubrin—are highly unsaturated and chemically unstable, making them susceptible to degradation in the presence of light, oxygen, pH fluctuations, and metal ions. Without adequate stabilisation, these compounds pose the risks of degradation and loss of bioactivity during storage or application. Strategies such as encapsulation in liposomes, derivatisation with soy protein, followed by incorporation into microgels or in the core–shell systems have been shown to significantly enhance pigment stability and protect them from environmental stressors.
      In vitro cytotoxicity data further emphasise the need for careful consideration. While red and orange polyketides derived from high-producing Monascus strains generally exhibit low or negligible cytotoxicity after 24–48 h of exposure (demonstrated in both linear and nonlinear models supplied by SYSTAT software), yellow polyketides from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus can exhibit moderate-to-high cytotoxicity, depending on the strain and exposure time. These findings underline the importance of selecting appropriate strains and using optimised formulations to ensure safety. Moreover, discrepancies between different cytotoxicity modelling methods, particularly between SYSTAT models and ATT BioQuest software, highlight the challenges of evaluating complex mixtures where synergistic or antagonistic interactions may occur. In this context, flexible nonlinear models are preferred for estimating IC50 values and assessing safety profiles in composite bioproducts.
      Another consideration is the potential for skin pigmentation, as coloured polyketides may interact with the skin’s surface, potentially causing staining or influencing melanin synthesis. This risk, however, can be mitigated through using the controlled release systems that modulate polyketide concentration and exposure time.
      Monascus-derived polyketides present a unique opportunity for innovation in dermato-cosmetic formulations due to their multifunctional bioactivities and favourable safety profile when applied topically. However, their successful application depends on advanced formulation strategies used to stabilise chemically sensitive polyketides. More in vitro and in vivo studies are warranted to fully elucidate their therapeutic potential and establish standardised protocols for their safe and effective use in skincare products.
      The novelty of this study lies in the following aspects:(1)To evaluate the IC50 of bioproducts containing different classes of coloured Monascus polyketides, the linear or nonlinear model provided by the SYSTAT programme is more suitable than the ATT Bioquest model, as the latter is not designed for bioproducts containing multiple bioactive molecules.(2)The polyketides derived from a new, high-productive Monascus sp. exhibit low or no cytotoxicity.
      A limitation of our studies is that the data were obtained only in silico or in vitro. More studies, both preclinical and clinical, are still needed to assess the safety of skincare bioproducts based on Monascus-derived polyketides.
      The perspectives of this study can be considered from different points of view, such as (1) Monascus sp. remains a promising source of bioactive compounds for skin healthcare protection. Moreover, Monascus sp.-derived polyketides represent sustainable and low-carbon biotechnological application, in agreement with the principles of the European Green Deal. (2) Fungal polyketides can be produced via solid-state biosynthesis (the method with the greatest productive yields) or by submerged biosynthesis. After polyketide extraction, the spent biomass can be reused in environmental protection applications (e.g., biosorbents for heavy metals) [38] or can be used as raw materials for new bioproducts for soil fertilization [39,40]. (3)The cytotoxicities exhibited against tumour cell lines, as evidenced by in silico and in vivo models [51,52,53], can be exploited to develop new conditioning approaches of fungal polyketides, to enhance selectivity for tumour cells through targeted delivery systems.
    
    
      5. Conclusions
      The data obtained during the studies performed in vitro, and/or in silico, reveal more aspects regarding the toxicity of Monascus-derived bioproducts, which contain coloured polyketides. The six main microbial polyketides derived from Monascus species exhibit significant lipophilic characteristics (the corresponding WlogPo/w values range between 3 and 4), making them suitable candidates for dermato-cosmetic formulations. Their affinity for the lipidic phase suggests their potential for use as active ingredients for skincare products. Ankaflavin, monascorubramine, and monascorubrin, due to their high molecular flexibility, may interact with diverse biological targets, including melanoma tumour cells, exhibiting a potential role in the antiproliferation of tumour skin cells. Their antioxidant antimicrobial and antitumor properties support their value in therapeutic and cosmetic applications. Due to their high unsaturation, the polyketides rubropunctatin, rubropunctamine, monascorubramine, and monascorubrin exhibit chemical instability, which may limit their use in topical formulations due to rapid degradation or undesired interactions with other ingredients. In silico permeability tests indicate that these polyketides possess a low capacity to cross the epidermal barrier, particularly monascin and rubropunctatin, which show negligible absorption. In vitro cytotoxicity tests on HaCaT cell lines show that yellow polyketides derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber exhibit moderate cytotoxicity, especially after 48 h exposure. The IC50 values suggest weak cytotoxicity for polyketides from the high-productive Monascus strain. The orange polyketides derived from Monascus ruber and Monascus purpureus exhibit low cytotoxicity, while those derived from highly productive strains do not exhibit cytotoxic effects. Both red and yellow polyketides from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber exhibit moderate cytotoxicity, while the orange and red polyketides derived from highly productive strains are non-cytotoxic. Cytotoxicity increases with longer exposure times (48 h), with the yellow and red polyketides maintaining or increasing their cytotoxic character, while orange polyketides from highly productive Monascus strains remain largely non-cytotoxic. The polyketides with moderate to low cytotoxicity, such as those derived from Monascus purpureus and Monascus ruber, and in particular the polyketides derived from high-productive Monascus sp., could be explored for pharmaceutical or cosmetic uses, with a focus on balancing efficacy and safety. The findings suggest that formulations using these polyketides may be safe for topical use, provided their chemical stability is considered.

Title: Recommendations on Periprocedural Skincare for Energy-Based Dermatologic Procedures

Abstract: AbstractThe use of energy-based device (EBD) aesthetic skin treatments is increasing in popularity. Implementation of periprocedural skincare may improve treatment-related outcomes, reduce recovery time, and reduce the frequency and severity of potential side effects. This review presents treatment recommendations to assist clinicians in optimizing integrated skincare to enhance EBD treatment outcomes. A panel of Australian 6 physicians (5 dermatologists, 1 plastic surgeon) developed 4 generalized EBD periprocedural skincare recommendations. These recommendations were divided based on 4 levels of skin barrier disruption caused by EBD treatment: none (or minimal), mild, moderate, and severe barrier disruption. The greater the disruption caused to the skin barrier, the greater care needed in choosing appropriate skincare products with suitable actives. Preprocedural skincare incorporating moisturizers, broad-spectrum sun-protection factor 50+ sunscreen, antioxidants, and niacinamide should be implemented at least 2 weeks before treatment to enhance skin barrier function and hydration. Postprocedure recommendations are made for the use of appropriate skincare actives that promote barrier repair and avoid further irritation. Prescription actives should be avoided for an appropriate period following EBD procedures; this period is dependent on the EBD treatment type and degree of skin barrier disruption it can cause. The algorithms provided here are aimed to assist clinicians in optimizing integrated skincare recommendations to enhance EBD treatment outcomes, promote healing, and reduce the likelihood of adverse events. Skincare recommendations made to patients should be based on the condition of the patient's skin, as well as the magnitude of skin barrier disruption caused by the EBD procedure.Level of Evidence: 5 (Therapeutic)

Body: The use of energy-based device (EBD) aesthetic treatments is increasing, with the Australian skin laser market (ablative and nonablative) expected to grow by >6% by 2030.1 Common EBDs used for facial skin treatment include intense pulsed light, pulsed dye laser, 532 nm potassium-titanyl-phosphate, 1064 nm neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet, as well as several other infrared and fractional ablative and nonablative lasers.2 Although considered relatively safe, these EBDs are associated with side effects such as inflamed, swollen, itchy, or painful skin, acne, microbial infection, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), and scarring.3 The risk of PIH is greatest with ablative laser treatments and in darker skin types; 1 study found >90% of Asian people with Skin Phototype IV undergoing ablative fractional CO2 laser treatment developed mild PIH.4
    The integration of standard skincare procedures before and after EBD treatments has been shown to reduce treatment-related side effects and improve treatment outcomes.5,6 To date, little guidance is available in the literature for periprocedural skincare for EBD procedures. As such, there remains inconsistency in periprocedural skincare measures implemented across centers.2,5 The aim of this review is to provide periprocedural recommendations and algorithms, based on the opinion of a group of experienced Australian dermatologists and plastic surgeons, to guide the use of appropriate skincare with the aim of improving treatment-related outcomes, reducing recovery time, and reducing common adverse events. Recommendations have been stratified according to the degree of skin barrier disruption caused by EBD treatment. Recommendations were developed by the authors at a face-to-face workshop on the topic.
    
      SKIN BARRIER SUPPORT
      An intact skin barrier is essential in maintaining skin function and health. The skin barrier protects from physical, chemical, and microbial assaults and acts to prevent excess water loss.7 The outermost layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, is mainly responsible for effective skin barrier function. EBD procedures commonly cause skin barrier disruption to varying degrees. A delay in skin barrier repair can lead to persistent erythema, hyper/hypopigmentation, scarring, acne, and milia.3 It also increases the potential for bacterial, fungal, and viral infection, with the most common infectant being the herpes simplex virus.8 The risk of EBD procedure-related adverse events may be reduced through the implementation of a periprocedural skin care regimen that can reinforce and/or repair the skin barrier.9 The skin barrier protection effect of skincare products is dependent on factors such as the type and concentration of the active compounds used, as well as the composition of the formulation.
      Immediately following skin barrier disruption, increased absorption, and dermal delivery of skin actives can occur, such as for Vitamin C and tranexamic acid. The benefits of enhanced delivery post-EBD treatment are particularly observed for low molecular weight hydrophilic or water-soluble agents. The composition or formulation of skin care products applied postlaser treatment affects both the delivery and safety.
      A brief overview is given below of products recommended for use periprocedurally to provide barrier support and repair. In general, basic skin care, such as moisturizers and sunscreen, is very cost-effective and aid skin barrier healing. Active agents are usually more expensive, and their cost can vary greatly. Active agents such as retinoids, Vitamin B3, hyaluronic acids, and antioxidants are usually very affordable. Conversely, growth factors, stem-cell extracts, and peptides are premium-costed items.
      
        Lipids
        Skin barrier permeability is regulated by the intercellular lipid-enriched matrix of the stratum corneum, which is composed of ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol.10 As such, barrier dysfunction is partly attributed to reduced delivery of secreted lipids to the stratum corneum, leading to a decrease in the number of extracellular lamellar bilayers present.11 The clinical response to laser rejuvenation treatment has been attributed, in part, to differential lipid metabolism in the skin. Microarray analysis of skin biopsies from fast vs slow treatment responders revealed greater activation of lipid metabolism and keratinocyte differentiation in fast responders, who showed greater upregulation of acyltransferases, fatty acid elongases, fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, fatty acid desaturases, and specific keratins that may contribute to epidermal barrier function.12 Barrier restoration can be aided by the topical application of physiological lipids (eg, ceramides, fatty acids, and cholesterol), which have been shown to improve skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and total ceramide and cholesterol content in facial skin.7,13
      
      
        Moisturizers
        Moisturizers form the basis of daily skincare. As well as improving the appearance of skin, some moisturizer constituents can have therapeutic effects and facilitate skin barrier repair.14,15 Actives found in moisturizers are categorized into 4 groups, namely emollients, humectants, occlusives, and plasticizers.15 Most moisturizers combine emollients, occlusives, and humectants. Emollients, such as fatty acids, fatty alcohols, cholesterol, squalene, and pseudoceramides, improve skin barrier function, membrane fluidity, and cell signaling. Humectants are low molecular weight substances, such as urea, sorbitol, panthenol, glycerol, propylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, and alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), which increase water content in the stratum corneum. Occlusives are oils and waxes, such as mineral oil, petroleum jelly, beeswax, silicones, and zinc oxide, which form a physical layer on the skin preventing TEWL.
      
      
        Antioxidants
        Some EBD skin treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), generate large amounts of reactive oxygen species. This is required for PDT therapeutic benefits, such as targeting precancerous skin cells or acne-causing bacteria. This also depletes the skin's antioxidant defenses and highlights the potential benefit of postprocedure antioxidant skin-targeted replacement to promote skin barrier repair and recovery.
        Antioxidants (eg, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, L-ascorbic acid, and ferulic acid) exert several beneficial effects, including the combat of free radicals, improved skin hydration, mitochondrial protection, and cell membrane support.16 In a study of 150 volunteers, treatment of skin with a topical antioxidant-containing cream improved epidermal thickness, elasticity, and skin moisture.17 In another double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 40 volunteers, the topical administration of the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin reduced photodamage and lipid peroxidation, and increased the surface lipids, skin hydration, and skin elasticity.18 Topical antioxidants are now widely used in the field of dermatology to promote skin barrier repair and improve barrier function. There is synergistic activity in combining multiple antioxidants, such as Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and ferulic acid. It is important to select stable formulation antioxidant products because formulation instability can lead to antioxidant degradation.
      
      
        Niacinamide
        Niacinamide (or nicotinamide) is a form of Vitamin B3 shown to improve stratum corneum barrier function. Niacinamide promotes the production of ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol in human keratinocytes of the stratum corneum.19 Topical niacinamide has been shown to increase the thickness of the stratum corneum of human skin by up to 10%.20 Topical niacinamide has also been shown to decrease TEWL and improve dry skin, reduce hyperpigmentation, improve photoaging and wrinkles, and reduce sebum production.19,21-25 Niacinamide, in combination with panthenol and madecassoside, was found to ameliorate various side effects following laser skin resurfacing procedures in 3 case reports.26 Additionally, niacinamide, in combination with tranexamic acid and kojic acid, was shown to enhance the laser treatment of melasma.27
      
      
        Retinoids
        Retinoids are a family of compounds derived from Vitamin A. Retinoids, such as retinol and tretinoin, have been used topically and systemically for decades for various skin conditions, particularly acne. Retinoids are thought to endow the greatest benefit when used before therapies that cause deep epidermal injury, rather than therapies that cause only superficial epidermal injury.28 Clinical studies have shown that the use of tretinoin before chemical peels, dermabrasion, and ablative and nonablative laser resurfacing improves subsequent procedural outcomes.28 Buchanan and Gilman have developed a treatment algorithm for tretinoin; preprocedural use of tretinoin has been recommended in ablative and nonablative laser facial resurfacing, surgical dermabrasion, and chemical peel resurfacing, with the tretinoin dose being dependent on the type of procedure.28 It is recommended that tretinoin is not started within 3 to 4 weeks before a resurfacing procedure because it can cause symptomatic dryness and exfoliation, as the facial skin has not yet had time to accommodate to its effects.28
      
      
        Botanicals
        Although the scientific evidence for the clinical efficacy of botanicals is often scarce, they have been used to treat skin conditions for centuries and still have a place in modern medicine. Botanicals often exhibit anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, which are often combined in a single plant extract and may be based on several compounds rather than 1 single compound.10,29
        Plant oils are widely used on the skin for cosmetic and medical purposes because they elicit positive physiological benefits. Plant oils can be classified into essential oils (volatile at room temperature) and fixed oils (stable at room temperature). Both essential and fixed oils have been shown to improve barrier function. Plant oils, such as jojoba, soybean, and avocado oils, remain on the skin surface, thus acting as a barrier to maintain moisture and reduce TEWL.30 Essential oils are thought to only penetrate the most superficial layers of the skin, forming a film to improve the epidermal water balance and improve the hydrolipidic balance and thus skin hydration.31,32 Care should be taken with the choice of essential oils and their concentrations because some oils can have cytotoxic properties at high concentrations.32 Additionally, essential oils can have a risk of skin sensitization and allergic contact dermatitis.33 Rather than enhance barrier function, some monounsaturated free fatty acids, such as oleic acid, may enhance skin barrier permeability and enhance chemical permeability through the skin layers.34
        Cucumber extract is rich in vitamins, particularly Vitamins A and C.35 In addition to its cosmetic benefits to the skin, cucumber extract also exerts cooling, soothing, and healing effects on irritated skin.36
        
Aloe vera contains compounds such as salicylic acid, magnesium lactate, and gel polysaccharides and has wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pruritic properties.37  Aloe vera can also increase skin hydration.38
      
      
        Sun Protection
        The use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun-protection factor (SPF) of 50+ is highly advisable before and following EBD procedures. For individuals with darker skin or prone to pigmentation, a sunscreen with broad ultraviolet A (UVA) protection (including filtration of long UVA wavelengths) is advisable, with or without the addition of a tinted sunscreen or a sunscreen with iron oxide for high-energy blue light protection. Adequate sunscreen protection is recommended to reduce the chance of pigmentation disorders, such as postprocedural melasma or PIH. The incidence of PIH can be high, estimated at 30% following laser skin resurfacing in people with Skin Phototype III and 90% in people with Skin Phototype IV.4,39
      
    
    
      SKINCARE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EBD PROCEDURES
      Four algorithms are presented, outlining integrated skincare recommendations for energy-based skin treatments (Figures 1-4). These recommendations are based on available literature and the opinion of experienced practitioners. Recommendations are stratified into 4 categories based on the degree of skin barrier disruption caused by treatments (none [or minimal], mild, moderate, or severe barrier disruption) and are divided into preprocedural skincare and postprocedural skincare. Special consideration should be taken for inflammatory skin conditions, which should be optimally managed by a qualified practitioner before EBD treatment. EBD procedures for people with skin conditions (eg, moderate-to-severe rosacea or acne, PIH) should be performed under the supervision of a dermatologist.

          Algorithm for the integrated facial skincare for energy-based device treatments that cause severe skin barrier disruption.
        
        
      
      
        Preprocedural Skincare
        The consistent application of moisturizers in the month leading up to EBD procedures is recommended for all skin types to optimize skin barrier function and hydration (Figures 1-4). The formulation choice of the moisturizer should be determined based on skin type, coexisting skin conditions, and consumer preference. Humectant moisturizers are recommended for people with rosacea and acne-prone skin to increase water content in the skin. Noncomedogenic moisturizers should be used for acne-prone skin. Moisturizers containing a combination of occlusives and humectants are advised to enhance the skin's water-retention capacity.40
        The use of antioxidants and niacinamide is recommended for all skin types to help maintain skin barrier integrity. It is also recommended that excessive sun exposure is avoided in the month leading up to EBD procedures. Physical protective measures, such as the use of wide-brimmed hats, should be implemented. The application of a broad-spectrum SPF50 or higher sunscreen is strongly recommended to prevent sun damage to the skin. Tinted sunscreens should be recommended for melasma- or PIH-prone skin to provide protection against visible light as well as UV light. Tinted sunscreens containing iron oxide have been shown to improve hyperpigmentation.41 The use of hydroquinone can also be considered for people with pigmentation, PIH, or existing melasma to lighten the skin and reduce the risk of melasma recurrence or PIH.
        For acne and acne-prone skin, the use of noncomedogenic products and hydrating moisturizers is recommended. Topical retinoids, AHAs, and beta hydroxy acids can be recommended to reduce inflammation, sebum production, and acne lesion formation.42
      
      
        Day of Procedure Skincare
        
          Immediately Preprocedure
          For optimal results, skin should be cleaned immediately before EBD treatment using appropriate cleansers able to remove makeup, sunscreen, and excess skin oils. An antimicrobial agent, such as chlorhexidine, isopropyl alcohol, or hypochlorous acid, is commonly used to sterilize the skin in order to reduce the chance of postprocedure infection.2
        
        
          Immediately (Within 24 h) Postprocedure
          Skincare requirements immediately after an EBD treatment are dependent on the type of EBD treatment used and the consequent degree of skin barrier disruption it can cause. Following EBD procedures that do not commonly cause any skin barrier disruption (Figure 1), good skincare incorporating a moisturizer, sunscreen as an absolute requirement, and antioxidants should also be advised to maximize improvements. Additionally, hyaluronic acid, peptides, and botanicals may be incorporated for appropriate patients. These agents act as additional moisturizing and messenger molecules and, in appropriate settings, may act synergistically with the EBDs used.
          Following EBD procedures that cause mild skin barrier disruption (Figure 2), the use of a thicker moisturizer, sunscreen, antioxidants (eg, ferulic acid), phloretin, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, panthenol, and pigment actives (eg, tranexamic acid) may all be used. Because mild disruption of the barrier has occurred, their access to deeper tissues is enhanced. Actives may be more potent in this scenario of barrier disruption; hence, the use of agents would be appropriate for use with broken skin.
          Following EBD procedures that cause moderate skin barrier disruption (Figure 3), agents should aim at efficacy but also to promote repair of the skin barrier. The use of antioxidants and peptides may be advantageously applied to increase their efficacy, whereas exosomes, stem-cell extracts, growth factors, and hypoallergenic botanicals (eg, cucumber extract) may also accelerate skin barrier restoration.
          Following EBD procedures that cause severe skin barrier disruption (Figure 4), the use of occlusive moisturizers may be necessary to act as a temporary artificial barrier, whereas exosomes, stem-cell extracts, growth factors, and peptides may accelerate the regeneration of the skin barrier, with further research needed to quantify this.
        
      
      
        Skin Aftercare
        Skincare requirements in the days to weeks following an EBD treatment are dependent on the type of EBD treatment used and the consequent degree of skin barrier disruption it can cause. Appropriate skincare following EBD procedures can both strengthen skin barrier function and enhance and maintain the results achieved by the EBD procedure.
        Following EBD procedures that do not usually cause any skin barrier disruption (Figure 1), a skin-type appropriate skincare routine, which includes a pH-balanced cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen, should be maintained. Prescription actives that the patient had been using before treatment can be continued as prescribed.
        Following EBD procedures that cause mild skin barrier disruption (Figure 2), a skincare routine comprised of a pH-balanced cleanser, neutral pH moisturizer (lotion or light cream with ceramides and glycerine), sunscreen, antioxidants, Vitamin B3, Vitamin B5, and hyaluronic acid is advised. The use of toners should be avoided because they can cause irritation and prolonged healing. The use of prescription actives should be avoided for 4 to 12 days postprocedure as some medicines, such as retinoids, AHAs, and hydroquinone, have been known to cause irritation and therefore may adversely impact healing.
        Following EBD procedures that cause moderate skin barrier disruption (Figure 3), a gentle cleanser and a richer cream-based moisturizer with ceramides, glycerine, petrolatum, and dimethicone can be used. Care should be taken to only use products tested for use on broken skin because there will be a higher risk of skin absorption following these EBD procedures. The use of toners, sodium-lauryl sulfates, and allergenics should be avoided to prevent irritation, increased inflammation, or sensitization. Caution should be taken with the use of irritating and prescription active ingredients, including retinoids, hydroquinone, and acids. These actives should be avoided for 2 to 3 weeks postprocedure in order to avoid any additional inflammation or irritation of the skin during the healing process.
        Following EBD procedures that cause severe skin barrier disruption (Figure 4), an occlusive moisturizer containing dimethicone or petrolatum is recommended. Dimethicone is a high-molecular-weight silicone. Because of its high molecular weight and hydrophobicity, dimethicone is poorly absorbed by skin, thus acting as a barrier to prevent water loss and the penetration of exogenous substances.43 Dimethicone is widely used for skin repair.44 The use of highly occlusive skin products, such as petrolatum, should be used cautiously on acne-prone skin, which may progress to acne breakout. Highly occlusive skin products may also cause milia; hence, they should only be used for up to 5 to 7 days post-EBD procedure. After this, a less occlusive moisturizer should be used. The use of irritating and prescription actives should be avoided for ≥24 days postprocedure or as determined by an experienced practitioner.
      
    
    
      LIMITATIONS
      The available evidence for the use of most skincare actives for facial EBD treatment is sparse, and mainly consists of studies with small sample size, making recommendations solely based on clinical evidence difficult. There is a need for more large randomized controlled trials in this area.
      The authors recognize that it is difficult to make generalized skincare recommendations because of the wide range of EBD treatments available. This is why recommendations were divided based on the degree of skin barrier disruption. These recommendations are general and may not suit everyone, especially in regions with broad ethnic skin color diversity and skin types, such as Australia. Therefore, clinician experience and discretion are paramount.
      The authors of this review are practitioners within Australia only, and their experience extends to this region. As such, recommendations presented should be considered within the context of individual regions.
    
    
      CONCLUSIONS
      A multimodal approach, which includes integrated skincare, is needed for the optimization of EBD treatment outcomes. The algorithms provided here are aimed to assist clinicians in optimizing integrated skincare recommendations to enhance EBD treatment outcomes, promote healing, and reduce the likelihood of adverse events. Skincare recommendations made to patients should be based on the condition of the patient's skin, as well as the magnitude of skin barrier disruption caused by the EBD procedure. The greater the disruption caused to the skin barrier, the greater care needed in choosing appropriate skincare products with suitable actives to promote barrier repair and avoid further irritation. Prescription actives should be avoided for an appropriate period following EBD procedures; this period is dependent on the EBD treatment type and degree of skin barrier disruption it can cause.

Title: Hamamelis virginiana L. in Skin Care: A Review of Its Pharmacological Properties and Cosmetological Applications

Abstract: Hamamelis virginiana L. (witch hazel) is a traditionally used medicinal plant, well-known for its dermatological applications. The plant’s bark and leaves contain a rich array of bioactive compounds, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, catechins, proanthocyanidins, and tannins, many of which exhibit antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and wound-healing properties. These activities have been verified by numerous in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as limited clinical trials. The H. virginiana extracts have demonstrated effectiveness against bacteria, fungi, and some viruses. Moreover, the extracts exert anti-inflammatory effects by modulating cytokine expression and NF-κB signaling, improve skin regeneration, and protect against UV-induced damage and pollution. This review highlights H. virginiana as a complex botanical resource to be used in dermatology and cosmetology and shows that current research offers encouraging results for its future therapeutic use, especially in skin treatment.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Hamamelis virginiana L. is a plant from the Hamamelidaceae family, which has been highly valued for years in both medicine and cosmetology. It is native to North America, where it is found along coastal regions, with its primary natural range stretching from southern Canada to the state of Virginia [1]. H. virginiana was well known to the native people of North America, who appreciated its medicinal properties [2]. It is commonly known as hamamelis, beadwood, and witch hazel, names which come from indigenous traditions and the plant’s unique seed dispersal mechanism—its ripe fruit capsule opens and shoots seeds at a distance of several meters [3,4].
      The leaves and bark of H. virginiana have been historically utilized in folk medicine, herbal therapy, and skincare, particularly by Native American communities. Witch hazel extracts are attributed with properties that may help in curing conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and skin dehydration, as well as easing insect bites, reactions to poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans), and razor burn [2,5]. Additionally, witch hazel has been used for various skin conditions in many European countries, including Poland and Ukraine [6], as well as in the South Balkan and East Mediterranean Region [7,8].
      Currently, H. viriniana is usually used in medicinal and cosmetic applications. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved witch hazel for inclusion in over-the-counter (OTC) formulations. Witch hazel, due to its soothing properties, is a common ingredient in OTC treatments aimed to relieve hemorrhoidal symptoms and vaginal irritations. Furthermore, it has been observed that formulations containing witch hazel extracts have a positive effect on blood vessels and enhance tissue perfusion [9,10]. Witch hazel extracts are widely used in cosmetic products for skincare. They are incorporated into anti-aging creams and gels as well as in cosmetics designed to soothe sunburn-related irritation [11,12,13,14,15]. H. virginiana, due to its soothing, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties, is commonly used in products designed to address the irritation of the scalp, including hair tonic and shampoo. It helps reduce sebum production, accelerates the healing of minor wounds, and promotes tissue regeneration [16,17]. For analogous reasons, and due to its non-toxic nature [18], witch hazel is also incorporated into oral hygiene products, including various mouthwashes, toothpastes, and regenerative lip balm [19,20,21]. H. virginiana is also applied in wound care management [22]. 
      The primary medicinal raw material obtained from H. virginiana is its leaves (Hamamelidis folium)—dried, whole, or crushed, containing 3–10% of tannin. In addition to the leaves, the bark of H. virginiana (8–12% tannins)—referred to as Hamamelidis cortex—is also widely used. Both Hamamelidis folium and Hamamelidis cortex are official herbal drugs listed in the European Pharmacopoeia. Key constituents of the Hamamelis plant include ellagitannins, hamamelitannins, flavonoids, gallic and ellagic acids, leucoanthocyanidins, and saponins. These compounds are believed to play a significant role in the cosmetic and medicinal properties of witch hazel preparations. 
      Despite its long-standing use and popularity in various therapeutic and cosmetic formulations, robust clinical data supporting its efficacy remain limited. Therefore, the aim of this review is to assess the current state of knowledge regarding H. virginiana, with a particular focus on its pharmacological potential in cosmetology. This is to help identify gaps in existing research and highlight the future directions of investigation to validate H. virginiana’s medicinal and cosmetic potential. 
      A literature survey was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Springer, and Google Scholar databases. The following keywords were used in the search: “Hamamelis virginiana” or “witch hazel”, combined with “skin”, “fibroblast”, “keratinocytes”, “melanocytes”, “antibacterial”, “anti-inflammatory”, “wound healing”, and “anti-aging”. The initial search results were screened by reviewing titles and abstracts for relevance. Full-text articles were then assessed to determine their suitability for inclusion. Studies in which the activity described was not related to dermal application or where the full text was not available in English were excluded from the review. The search period covered the years from 1990 to 2025.
    
    
      2. Botanical and Phytochemical Characterization of Hamamelis virginiana
      
        2.1. Botanical Characteristic
        H. virginiana is a deciduous shrub or tree that typically reaches heights of up to 6 m (Figure 1). 
        The plant exhibits significant morphological variability depending on the cultivation area. It often forms dense, multi-stemmed clusters growing from its base. The bark is light brown, smooth, and scaly, with the inner bark displaying a reddish shade. 
        The leaves are oval, measuring 3.7–16.7 cm in length and 2.5–13 cm in width, and exhibit an asymmetrical base and a rounded or acute apex, with margins that are wavy-toothed. The petiole is short and stout, measuring 6–15 mm in length. The midrib is more or less hairy, with 6–7 pairs of primary veins. Mature leaves develop a dark green upper surface with a whiter underside. In autumn, the leaves transition to a yellow shade with distinctive rusty spots. Witch hazel blooms between late autumn and winter, occasionally extending to February. The flowers of the witch hazel are pale to bright-yellow, sometimes red or orange, and consist of four ribbon-like petals. They are accompanied by four short stamens and grow in dense collections. Flowering begins in mid-autumn and persists until late autumn. The calyx is four-parted, densely pubescent, and orange-brown on the inner surface. Two or three bractlets are present at the base of each flower. The fruit is a hard, woody capsule, 1.0–1.4 cm long, that matures one year after pollination. When ripening, the capsule rips vigorously at the apex, ejecting two shiny black seeds to distances of up to 10 m from the parent plant [1,23].
      
      
        2.2. Phytochemical Composition 
        Despite the recognized medicinal potential of Hamamelis virginiana L., relatively few comprehensive phytochemical studies have been conducted, and much of the existing literature remains outdated. Research shows that various parts of the plant—leaves, bark, twigs, and stems—are rich in phenolic acids, flavonoids, hydrolyzable and condensed tannins, and volatile constituents. The chemical composition of H. virginiana extracts depends strongly on the extraction solvent and method, with water, aqueous ethanol, methanol, acetone, and ethyl acetate yielding various compound profiles. Among the most frequently reported compounds are gallic acid and its derivatives, catechin, epicatechin, hamamelitannin, quercetin and kaempferol glycosides, caffeoylquinic acids, and oligomeric and polymeric proanthocyanidins. Advanced analytical techniques—such as high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS), ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry using quadrupole time-of-flight (UHPLC-MS-qToF), and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS)—have enabled precise identification and quantification of these metabolites. Additionally, fractionation methods have facilitated the isolation of complex hydrolyzable tannins. The marked variation in chemical profiles based on extraction parameters highlights the need for standardized methodologies in phytochemical research. 
        Leaf extracts, particularly those obtained using hot water or acetone–water mixtures, demonstrated the greatest diversity of phenolic compounds. Duckstein and Stintzing used HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis to identify several derivatives of caffeic and quinic acids—namely, 3-, 4-, and 5-caffeoylquinic acids—as well as flavonoid glycosides, including quercetin rutinoside, kaempferol hexoside, and kaempferol–galloyl hexoside [24]. Amêndola et al. demonstrated that methanolic leaf extracts also contained a wide array of bioactive compounds, including chlorogenic, ferulic, caffeic, ellagic, and salicylic acids, along with flavonoids such as apigenin, luteolin, and myricetin, and their respective glycosides (e.g., luteolin-7-o-glucoside, quercitrin, and rutin) [25]. Piazza et al., while studying glycolic extracts from twigs and bark, identified a broad spectrum of flavan-3-ols, including catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, and epigallocatechin, as well as the hydrolyzable tannin hamamelitannin. Using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/QqQ-MS/MS), they also detected additional phenolic acids such as ferulic, gallic, and protocatechuic acids, along with flavonoids like quercetin, isorhamnetin, and naringenin [26]. Wang et al. investigated water–ethanol extracts using HPLC-UV analysis, which confirmed the presence of gallic acid and hamamelitannin in both bark and leaves [27].
        In turn, the fractionation of aqueous ethanol extracts has confirmed the presence of pentagalloyl glucose and tannic acid. UHPLC-MS qToF analysis further revealed a comprehensive profile of gallotannins in leaf extracts, spanning mono- to decagalloyl hexoses, including 1-o-galloyl-β-d-glucose and hamamelitannin [28]. Furthermore, Djapić demonstrated the presence of additional compounds in methanolic leaf extracts, including chlorophyll catabolites such as bilin-type and bilinone-type degradation products, as determined by HPLC analysis [29].
        In addition to polyphenols, volatile compounds represent another class of phytochemicals that have been studied in H. virginiana. Engel et al. performed a steam distillation and water extraction of leaves and bark, which enabled the identification of over 170 volatile constituents. These included aliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and esters. The chemical composition of the volatile fraction varied depending on the raw material used. In the leaf extracts, the major components are hydrocarbons (62.85%), monoterpenes (7.36%), terpenes (3.94%), and aldehydes (3.79%), followed by esters (0.95%), alcohols (0.86%), and ketones (0.83%). In comparison, bark extracts contain hydrocarbons (45.42%), terpenes (21.17%), monoterpenes (8.34%), alcohols (5.31%), aldehydes (6.14%), ketones (1.55%), esters (0.59%), and phenylpropanoids in significant quantities (over 7%) [30]. Cheesman et al., using GC-MS analysis, also detected a variety of alcohols and ethers containing aromatic rings and exhibiting potential biological activity [31]. 
        Figure 2 illustrates some representatives of specific classes of polyphenolic compounds identified in H. virginiana extracts. Table 1 summarizes the current findings on the phytochemical constituents of H. virginiana, with emphasis on solvent, extraction method, compound identification, and analytical techniques.
      
    
    
      3. Biological Activity of H. virginiana
      
        3.1. Traditional Uses and Regulatory Status of H. virginiana in Europe
        The leaves and bark of H. virginiana have a long-standing history of use in traditional medicine and herbal remedies, particularly among Native American tribes. They utilized witch hazel preparations for a variety of skin-related ailments, including inflammation, wounds, insect bites, and irritation caused by poison ivy (T. radicans). In folk medicine, witch hazel extracts have been valued for their astringent, anti-inflammatory, and soothing properties. They have been traditionally employed to manage skin disorders such as eczema, psoriasis, and general skin dryness, as well as to alleviate minor injuries, razor burn, and local irritation. Furthermore, a decoction of the bark, due to its astringent properties, has traditionally been used to treat hemoptysis, hematemesis, and other types of hemorrhages, as well as diarrhea, dysentery, excessive mucous discharges, and hemorrhoids [2,5,40]. 
        Beyond North America, the therapeutic use of H. virginiana has also become widespread in Europe. In countries such as Poland and Ukraine, witch hazel-based preparations have been used in ethnobotanical practices to treat inflammatory skin conditions and promote skin regeneration. Similarly, in the South Balkan and Eastern Mediterranean Region, traditional medicine has incorporated witch hazel for centuries, particularly in topical applications aimed at reducing swelling, redness, and irritation associated with minor dermatological complaints. Distilled witch hazel has traditionally been used to temporarily soothe eye irritation caused by dryness or environmental factors such as wind and sunlight [6,7,8].
        The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has published two monographs on witch hazel—one for the bark and the other for the leaves. Both publications contain documented information on the medicinal use of the extracts. The monographs provide details on possible herbal preparations derived from raw materials, including the following: dried, comminuted herbal substance; tincture (fresh leaves) (ratio of herbal substance to extraction solvent 1:10, extraction solvent: ethanol 45% v/v); liquid extract (fresh leaves) (DER 1:1, extraction solvent: ethanol 45% v/v); liquid extract (DER 1:1, extraction solvent: ethanol 30% m/m); liquid extract (DER 1:2, extraction solvent: ethanol 60% v/v); and dry extract (DER 5–7.7:1, extraction solvent: ethanol 30% m/m). The documents also specify the forms and routes of safe administration (cutaneous, oromucosal, rectal, and anorectal) and indicate that the therapy is safe, with little or no side effects other than skin irritation, and no risk of overdose [41,42]. The reports also establish traditional therapeutic indications based on well-established usage for both pharmaceutical materials (cortex and folium): for the relief of minor skin inflammation and dryness, the symptomatic relief of itching and burning associated with hemorrhoids, and as a mouth and throat rinse to relieve minor inflammation of the oral mucosa. The authors specify that these products are traditional herbal medicinal products intended for use in the specified indications exclusively based on long-standing use [41,42].
        The European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy (ESCOP) has also issued its own specifications for these two pharmaceutical raw materials. The authors of the reports focused on similar aspects, such as preparation from plant material, forms of administration, applications, and safety, also adding information on the content of active compounds. They brought together relevant data on the possible physiological roles of Hamamelis leaf and bark extracts and their major constituents [43,44].
      
      
        3.2. Literature-Based Insights into the Skin-Related Bioactivity of H. virginiana
        In the context of potential benefits for skin health, several biological activities of H. virginiana extracts are particularly important to investigate, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities, wound healing effects, and UV protection. The antioxidant action helps neutralize free radicals, which are a major contributor to skin aging and cellular damage. Anti-inflammatory properties are also crucial, as they help prevent chronic inflammation that accelerates skin aging. Moreover, antimicrobial activity is especially relevant for products aimed at acne-prone or sensitive skin, where controlling microbial balance is essential. The extract’s potential to promote skin cell regeneration and support wound healing is equally important, as these processes are vital for maintaining healthy, resilient, and youthful-looking skin. Finally, UV-protective properties can help shield the skin from photoaging and other harmful effects of sun exposure.
        Figure 3 presents the main directions of action studied in the case of H. virginiana extracts.
        
          3.2.1. Antibacterial Effects
          Due to its unique chemical composition, H. virginiana appears to be a promising antibacterial agent, and its antibacterial and antifungal properties have been extensively studied, covering both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. It should be noted that these two types of bacteria differ significantly in their cell wall structures, and therefore, distinct molecular mechanisms are involved in the bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects against Gram (−) and Gram (+) strains.
          The most common parameter used to assess antibacterial activity is the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the lowest concentration that shows no visible bacterial growth in broth. In agar-based assays, activity is often measured by the zone of inhibition (ZOI), defined as the radius of the clear area surrounding a disk infused with the antimicrobial agent. Additionally, the minimum bactericidal or fungicidal concentration (MBC/MFC), representing the lowest concentration that reduces microbial viability by 99.9%, is sometimes evaluated. 
          Numerous studies have confirmed the effectiveness of both the leaves and bark of H. virginiana against various pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains. Cheesman et al. tested leaf extracts obtained using solvents of varying polarity against a sensitive bacterial strain and clinical isolates expressing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), including Escherichia coli, ESBL E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, ESBL K. pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The ethyl acetate, hexane, and chloroform extracts showed no activity. However, the water and methanolic extracts demonstrated antibacterial effects, with zones of inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 8 to 12 mm. The extracts were more effective against ESBL E. coli compared to sensitive E. coli and showed greater potency against MRSA than against S. aureus. Additionally, they evaluated the effects of combining these extracts with common antibiotics, finding additive interactions in three combinations: aqueous or methanolic extracts with tetracycline against MRSA, and methanol extract combined with chloramphenicol against E. coli. It is worth noting that additive interactions enhance efficacy, which may allow for lower antibiotic doses and thereby help minimize the risk of side effects [31]. The same experimental protocol was used to test the activity of the extracts against several Staphylococcus spp. (S. oralis, S. pyogenes, S. mutans) and Streptococcus spp. (S. epidermidis, S. aureus) strains. Similarly to previous findings, only the water and methanolic extracts showed activity. These extracts inhibited the growth of S. oralis, S. pyogenes, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus in both semi-solid and liquid cultures. However, S. mutans exhibited near-complete resistance to H. virginiana. Additive interactions were observed with the aqueous extract combined with chloramphenicol against S. oralis and with the methanol extract combined with ciprofloxacin against S. aureus [45]. The water and methanol extracts were also active against P. aeruginosa. Interestingly, combining these extracts with ciprofloxacin reduced the antimicrobial potency of each component when compared to their individual effects; therefore, these agents should not be used in combination [46]. 
          The antimicrobial activity of the decoctions and methanol extracts from the leaves was also observed against anaerobic and facultative aerobic periodontopathic bacteria, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Actinomyces odontolyticus. Similarly to the findings of Cheesman et al., Iauk et al. observed that methanol extracts demonstrated stronger antibacterial activity than decoctions, which are typically prepared by boiling in water [47]. The study also shows that rinsing with Hamamelis tea reduces initial bacterial colonization and increase the salivary pellicle thickness, thereby supporting oral hygiene and helping to prevent diseases such as caries and periodontitis [48]. In turn, Amêndola et al. investigated the antifungal effects of propylene glycol leaf extract, finding that it acts as a fungicide against Candida spp. (including C. albicans, C. dubliniensis, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii, C. krusei, and C. tropicalis) [25,49]. However, its antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and S. mutans was significantly lower, with even MIC values reaching over 50 mg/mL [25]. The study also examined the reduction in microbial biofilms after 5 min and 24 h of treatment using H. virginiana extracts. The extract was effective, but the results were strongly dependent on concentration and time. After 5 min, a concentration of 100 mg/mL led to an over 75% reduction in biofilm for most Candida spp., with the exception of C. krusei, which showed a 56% reduction. Less effectiveness was observed with bacterial strains, where biofilm reduction ranged from 52% to 79% at 100 mg/mL, except for E. coli, where 50 mg/mL resulted in a 75% reduction in biofilm. After 24 h, a concentration of 12.5 mg/mL reduced the biofilm formation of Candida spp., E. coli, and K. pneumoniae by over 79%. The least effective result was observed with E. faecalis, where 50 mg/mL produced a biofilm reduction of 91%. Both S. aureus and S. mutans showed a reduction of 93% at a concentration of 25 mg/mL [25]. The effectiveness of an alcoholic extract from H. virginiana in inhibiting the biofilm of clinical isolates of S. aureus was also demonstrated by Pereira et al. [50]. 
          Rasooly et al. conducted research on the antibacterial properties of the commercial product whISOBAX (witch hazel bark ethanolic-water extract). They found that it suppresses bacterial growth and inhibits pathogenic mechanisms, including biofilm formation and toxin production. The greatest activity was observed against S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus faecium, and E. faecalis, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In contrast, the effects on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly weaker. Furthermore, the extract acted synergistically with linezolid and chloramphenicol and showed cumulative effects with vancomycin and amikacin against S. aureus [51]. Additionally, its combination with green tea enhanced antibacterial activity against S. epidermidis and S. aureus [52]. Interestingly, despite its inhibitory effect on the growth and biofilm formation of pathogenic bacteria, whISOBAX has been found to stimulate the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum in a nutritionally limited environment, while also sustaining its growth in a nutrient-rich environment [53]. It also protected against cell death induced by aerobic growing conditions [54]. Therefore, the authors concluded that it may support the maintenance of a healthy microbiome in the organism. 
          The literature data on the antibacterial and antifungal effects of H. virginiana extracts are summarized in Table 2.
          The antibacterial activity of witch hazel has been utilized in complex formulations. It was found that witch hazel bark extract (whISOBAX) enhances the antibacterial effects of commercially available teat dips, which can help prevent bacterial infections in dairy cattle [58]. Furthermore, a formulation with Hamamelis distillate and urea showed an inhibitory effect on S. aureus and Candida albicans [12]. In turn, hazel leaf extract in combination with Krameria lappacea root and Salix alba bark was used to develop a novel formulation with potential application in managing symptoms associated with seborrheic dermatitis. Both alone and when in the mixture, hazel extract was effective against MSSA, MRSA, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Salmonella enterica, and it showed no cytotoxicity on human keratinocytes [39]. Interestingly, Nardini et al. showed that extracts of H. virginiana may be useful in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy, as it exhibits photosensitizing properties combined with low toxicity to fibroblast cells and could therefore serve as an alternative to conventional photosensitizers [59].
          In addition, attempts have also been made to develop antibacterial materials containing H. virginiana extract with potential applications such as wound dressings. However, these efforts have yet to yield successful results. For example, Solis-Arevalo et al. investigated the antibacterial and antifungal properties of leaf extract on its own and observed a significant inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Nevertheless, when they incorporated the extract into schizophyllan-based membranes, they did not observe any antibacterial effect [60]. Similarly, a lack of antibacterial activity was observed by Molin et al., who developed a bacterial cellulose membrane with aqueous and glycolic extracts of witch hazel and tested it against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans [61]. The authors suggested that the concentration of active compounds in the materials prepared in this way is too low. On the other hand, newly developed bio-packaging material based on linseed mucilage with incorporated H. virginiana leaf extract effectively decreased foodborne pathogens, including L. monocytogenes, S. Typhi, S. aureus, and E. coli, with zones of inhibition ranging from 19.50 to 22.50 mm [55]. 
          The antiviral efficacy of H. virginiana was also documented. Theisen et al. demonstrated the antiviral effects of bark and leaf extracts (60% ethanol), fractions containing tannins of different molecular weights, and individual tannins against influenza A virus (IAV) and human papillomavirus (HPV). They found that the antiviral effect of the leaf extract was similar to that of the bark extract, but the latter demonstrated lower cytotoxicity. High molecular weight condensed tannins, obtained via ultrafiltration, exhibited the highest activity. This fraction, along with the bark extract, inhibited the early stages and, to a lesser extent, later stages of the IAV life cycle and also prevented HPV attachment. Interestingly, high molecular weight tannins inhibited both IAV receptor binding and neuraminidase activity. In contrast, low molecular weight compounds, such as gallic acid, epigallocatechin gallate, and hamamelitannin, inhibited neuraminidase but not hemagglutination [32]. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins that play essential roles in the infection cycle, facilitating the initial attachment of the virus to the host cell and aiding in the release of newly formed viral particles from the host cell, respectively. Notably, the activity of the fractions and the extract was superior to that of the individual isolated compounds [32]. The fraction containing oligomeric and polymeric proanthocyanidins isolated from the hydroethanol extract of H. virginiana bark exhibited significant antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [62]. On the other hand, a standardized dry extract of H. virginiana leaf, obtained using 50% ethanol, showed no anti-HIV activity in infected human lymphocytic cells [63]. 
        
        
          3.2.2. Anti-Inflammatory Activity
          Anti-inflammatory activity is another important feature of plant extracts in the context of skin health. In addition to directly soothing inflammatory conditions, anti-inflammatory agents can help counteract chronic low-grade inflammation, known as ‘inflammaging,’ by reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. The effects of H. virginiana on various inflammatory mediators have been extensively studied, primarily using cell models with induced inflammation.
          Piazza et al. investigated the potential of a standardized bark extract against eczema (AD) using human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) induced with various cytokines including TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha), IL-4 (interleukin 4), and a mixture of TNF-α/IL-4 and TNF-α/IFN-γ (interferon gamma) [64]. They found that the extract suppressed the release of mediators related to skin autoimmunity—IL-6 and IL-17C—and allergy—TSLP (thymic stromal lymphopoietin), IL-6, CCL26 (chemokine (C-C motif) Ligand 26), and MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase). All of these biomarkers are important contributors to the pathogenesis of the inflammatory processes in AD. However, the activity of the extract was only partially attributed to the hamamelitannin content, as this compound affected only TSLP and CCL26 and showed no inhibitory effect on the other factors investigated. The mechanism of action of the extract involved the disruption of NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells)-driven transcription. Additionally, it inhibited the proliferative effects of IL-4 and restored the expression of K10, a protein marker of skin differentiation [64]. In another study, Piazza et al. found that the extract decreased IL-6 and IL-8 levels in HaCaT cells infected with Cutibacterium acnes and IL-8 levels in HaCaT cells stimulated with TNF-α. Although it showed no inhibitory effect on bacterial growth, the observed anti-inflammatory properties could be beneficial in acne treatment. The results suggest that the biological activity of the extract is associated with its abundance of epicatechin-3-gallate [26].
          In turn, Amêndola et al. evaluated the effect of the H. virginiana extract leaf on murine macrophages (RAW 264.7 cell line) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and found that the propylene glycol extract suppressed the production of IL-1β and TNF-α. The extract also reduced nitric oxide (NO) levels [25]. It is worth mentioning that although NO supports controlling infections by helping to eliminate pathogens through its antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects, excessive or prolonged NO production can contribute to tissue damage and promote chronic inflammation. 
          The anti-inflammatory activity of H. virginiana can also be associated with the inhibition of lipoxygenase (LOX), an enzyme that plays a key role in the metabolism of arachidonic acid and contributes to the production of leukotrienes and prostaglandins. This was documented in a study by Hartisch et al., who observed that galloylated proanthocyanidins isolated from the extract suppressed 5-LOX activity [65]. In turn, Manville et al. stated that the dual anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of witch hazel bark extract may result from the polymodal modulation of multiple potassium channel types [66]. An in vivo study by Erdelmeier et al. also confirmed the anti-inflammatory activity of H. virginiana. They observed that proanthocyanidins from the hydroethanol extract from bark exhibited strong anti-inflammatory effects in croton oil-induced dermal inflammation in mice [62]. In the study by Liu et al. [67], it was demonstrated that witch hazel inhibited the TNFα-induced expression of cytokines IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-8, and PGE2 (prostaglandin E₂) in HaCaT cells. The anti-inflammatory effect was further confirmed ex vivo in skin tissue with induced inflammation using a commercially available Cell Stimulation Cocktail, as the extract significantly decreased the levels of IL-6, IL-17A, TNFα, and IFN-γ compared to the control. Additionally, an analysis of skin barrier function markers, such as loricrin and transglutaminase-1, showed notable increases compared to the inflamed control, indicating improvements in skin integrity [67]. However, it should be noted that no data is given regarding the type of extract and even the part of plants taken for investigation. 
          The data regarding the anti-inflammatory activity of H. virginiana, including experimental models and observed effects, are compiled in Table 3.
        
        
          3.2.3. Wound Healing Properties and the Other Effects on Skin
          Wound healing is a complex, multi-stage process involving hemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation, and tissue remodeling. After bleeding is stopped, an inflammatory response is triggered to prevent infection. In the next stage, there is increased cell proliferation, where new tissue and blood vessels form. Finally, in the remodeling phase, the tissue strengthens and matures [69]. 
          Antibacterial activity is a critical feature in wound healing, as it helps create a microorganism-free environment and prevents wound infections. Similarly, anti-inflammatory action is essential to suppress prolonged inflammation, which is undesirable because it can lead to excessive tissue breakdown and inhibit effective tissue repair [70]. In this context, H. virginiana, which exhibits both types of activities, appears promising.
          Another aspect to consider in wound healing is the regulation of proteolytic and oxidative enzymes at the wound site. Proteolytic enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), help clear damaged tissue and enable cell migration, while oxidative enzymes contribute to pathogen defense by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). On the other hand, excessive enzyme activity can degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and, therefore, harm healthy tissue. Thus, maintaining an appropriate balance of these enzymes is crucial for optimal healing [69,71]. 
          Several studies describe the effects of H. virginiana extracts on various aspects related to wound healing. Dezena and da Silva, who investigated the impact of a tincture prepared by percolation with 70% ethanol (10% w/v) on dewaxed and hydrated skin fragments from Wistar rats, found that it exhibited significant proteolytic activity on collagen and elastic fibers but did not affect epithelial and connective tissue cells, epidermal attachments, pigments, or granules [72]. Thring et al. observed that the water extract from the aerial parts and the distillate inhibited elastase, and additionally, the water extract showed anti-collagenase activity [68,73]. This type of activity could also be significant in anti-aging activity. Furthermore, polyphenols from H. virginiana stems, used in the preparation of collagen sponges for chronic wound dressings, demonstrated a suppression of two major enzymes that impair the wound healing process—myeloperoxidase (MPO) and collagenase [74]. Rocasalbas et al. used the phenolic fraction, consisting of a mixture of proanthocyanidin dimers and hydrolysable tannins (hamamelitannin, pentagalloyl glucose, and methyl gallate) isolated from stems, to develop bioactive hydrogel dressings. The hydrogels inhibited the growth of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, bacteria which are commonly found in chronic wounds, and demonstrated inhibitory capacity against myeloperoxidase and collagenase [75]. It was also observed that the proanthocyanidins isolated from bark significantly increased the proliferation of human skin keratinocytes [34]. 
          The protective effects of H. virginiana extract on skin have also been reported. Ramos et al. indicate that H. virginiana extract has potential as an antisolar agent, as evidenced by spectrophotometric measurements of sun protection factors and UV absorption [76]. In turn, Choi et al. found that H. virginiana can be a valuable ingredient in anti-pollution skincare products, as the extract from its stem and leaves lowered Ca²⁺ influx in HaCaT cells stimulated by particulate matter (PM2.5). The mechanism of action involved proteinase-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2), NF-κB, and occludin. The extract supported HaCaT cells in recovering from DPM-induced damage. The increased levels of PAR-2 (A) and NF-κB (B) induced by DPM were reduced to, or below, normal levels. Additionally, the decreased level of occludin caused by DPM returned to a normal state. This effect was attributed to hexagalloylglucose, isolated from the extract, which alone exhibited this type of activity [77].
          In another study, the fractions from witch hazel bark rich in galloylated tannin showed anticancer potential against melanoma, with only mild cytotoxic effects on human skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Additionally, it was found to act as an antihemolytic agent, protecting red blood cells from hemolysis induced by oxidative stress [33].
        
        
          3.2.4. Antioxidant Activity
          Antioxidant activity is the most commonly studied type of action in the case of plant extracts because its ability to scavenge free radicals can support the skin’s defense mechanisms against oxidative stress. This is particularly important in protecting the skin from premature aging, inflammation, and damage caused by environmental factors such as UV radiation and pollution. The antioxidant properties of H. virginiana were documented in many studies based on common chemical tests including DPPH, ABTS, and ORAC [25,26,57,78]. H. virginiana has also been found to actively scavenge singlet oxygen, superoxide anion radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and peroxynitrite, and it has been shown to prevent the oxidation of lipid bilayers [79,80,81]. Cells-based assay confirmed the antioxidant effects of both extracts and isolated components. It has been found that H. virginiana protects murine dermal fibroblasts against oxidative stress [79] and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in H2O2-stimulated HaCaT [26]. However, this effect was not associated with an influence on catalase, one of the main enzymes responsible for maintaining redox balance in the cell, as no impact on the enzyme’s activity was observed [26,68]. The direct antioxidant effects of the water extract from the aerial parts was also demonstrated in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells, as shown by the Antioxidant Power 1 (AOP1) assay, which measures the ability to neutralize intracellular free radicals produced by photo-induction. This effect was associated with the modulation of the ARE/Nrf2 (antioxidant response element/nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2) transcriptional pathway, which regulates the expression of numerous proteins involved in cellular antioxidant systems [82]. In turn, Liu et al. investigated the efficacy of witch hazel in mitigating UVA-induced oxidative stress and found a significant reduction in ROS levels when skin samples were pretreated with witch hazel formulations. Furthermore, treatment with the WH formula resulted in a significant decrease in 4-hydroxynonenal, a byproduct of the oxidation of sebum and keratinocyte cell membrane lipids, which had been significantly increased by UVA exposure [67].
        
        
          3.2.5. In Vivo Studies
          Although in vivo studies on Hamamelis are limited, several investigations have examined its skin-related effects. Hughes-Formella et al. found that a topical lotion containing a 10% distillate of H. virginiana effectively reduced erythema induced by UV irradiation [83,84]. Furthermore, its extract has been effective in treating accidental skin injury caused by sodium hypochlorite solution during dental treatment. The extract alleviated burning and tenderness, and, after three months, reduced skin discoloration [85]. In turn, Wolff and Kieser assessed the clinical effects of a Hamamelis ointment containing a distillate of leaves and bark for treating inflammation and minor skin injuries in young patients up to the age of 11. They reported that ratings of the treatment by physicians and parents were similar to or even better than those for dexpanthenol [86]. A randomized controlled prospective cohort study conducted by Veronese et al. demonstrated that a cream for the eyelids and eye contour area with H. virginiana bark extract improved symptoms of eyelid dermatitis [87]. The anti-inflammatory effectiveness of oil-in-water emulsions containing H. virginiana distillate was also tested by Korting et al. in humans with inflammation induced by UV irradiation and cellophane tape stripping. They found that the emulsions reduced UV-induced erythema [88]. The emulsion also reduced itching and erythema in patients with atopic eczema; however, its effect was lower than that of hydrocortisone cream [89]. Moreover, a retrospective observational study by Trüeb, which included 1373 of patients, showed the effectiveness of witch hazel-based shampoo and tonic for the treatment of sensitive scalp irritation [17].
          A preliminary in vivo evaluation of Hamamelis procyanidins further supports their skin benefits. A semi-solid formulation containing 1% Hamamelis procyanidins was tested for its ability to prevent irritant contact dermatitis induced by sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) [34]. SLS irritation caused an increase in transepidermal water loss (TEWL), indicating local barrier disruption, but treatment with Hamamelis procyanidins significantly reduced this TEWL increase. Preventing TEWL is crucial for maintaining healthy skin because loss of moisture leads to dryness and irritation. An impaired skin barrier also makes the skin more susceptible to environmental aggressors, allergens, and pathogens, which can trigger inflammation and various skin disorders. Furthermore, pretreatment with the Hamamelis formulation clearly reduced clinical signs of inflammation. These findings were corroborated by colorimetry measurements assessing skin redness: SLS-induced irritation significantly increased erythema, which was noticeably reduced following treatment with procyanidins [34].
          There are also a few studies concerning the effects of H. virginiana when taken orally. Natella et al. investigated the activity of aerial parts H. virginiana extract (Hamaforton™ capsule with 300 mg of the extract) on gene dysregulation induced by UVA radiation in human dermal fibroblasts, using a combination of in vivo and ex vivo experiments. In the first part of the study, 12 healthy volunteers received either Hamaforton™ or a placebo in a randomized, blinded crossover trial. In the next phase, serum containing Hamaforton™ metabolites—including 4-O-methyl gallic acid, 4-O-methyl gallic acid sulfate, and trimethyl gallic acid glucuronide—was used to enrich the culture medium of dermal fibroblasts exposed to UVA. Natella et al. observed an increase in the expression of ten genes associated in repair processes critical for the maintenance of skin integrity, suggesting that these metabolites may play a role in damage recovery [90]. In turn, Duwiejua et al. investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of a 70% ethanol leaf extract administered before and after the induction of rat paw edema. They found that H. virginiana was effective when administered after inflammation was induced, but it was only effective in the chronic state [91].
        
      
      
        3.3. Biological Activity of Hamamelitannin
        The most characteristic compound found in H. virginiana is hamamelitannin, which is present in the bark, stem, and leaves. This compound, together with other galloylated proanthocyanidins, contributes to the biological activity of the plants. Hamamelitannin isolated from H. virginiana exhibits potent free radical scavenging activity, as demonstrated in various chemical assays, including DPPH [92,93]. It has been identified as a strong inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX), an enzyme involved in the progression of inflammation [65]. Masaki et al. found that hamamelitannin exerts protective effects against superoxide-induced damage in murine fibroblasts, showing greater activity than gallic acid, which constitutes its functional units [94]. Additionally, it demonstrated protective activity against UVB-induced cell damage in murine skin fibroblasts [95]. It has also been found to prevent the depolymerization of hyaluronic acid caused by oxidative stress [96].
        The antimicrobial effects of hamamelitannin have also been reported. It has been found that hamamelitannin was effective against S. aureus isolates resistant to various antimicrobials and was able to inhibit biofilm production [97]. In a study by Cobrado et al. conducted in mice, it was demonstrated that subcutaneously implanted catheters previously soaked in a hamamelitannin solution exhibited significant infection control against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Acinetobacter baumannii. This compound reduced both the metabolic activity and biomass of the biofilm [98]. Hamamelitannin also showed antiviral efficacy against influenza A virus and human papillomavirus, with its mechanism of action involving neuraminidase inhibition [32]. The anti-inflammatory activity of hamamelitannin was studied by Piazza et al. in HaCaT cells stimulated with various inflammatory agents, including TNF-α, IL-4, TNF-α/IL-4, and TNF-α/IFN-γ. They observed a decrease in the expression of TSLP and CCL26, with no significant effect on IL-17C, MMP-9, or IL-6 [26,64].
      
    
    
      4. A Global Regulation and Market Status of H. virginiana
      H. virginiana has a long-standing tradition of use in both medicinal and cosmetic formulations across the globe. Its pharmacological properties, such as its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and wound-healing effects, have contributed to its popularity. However, the regulatory status and market presence of witch hazel in products vary significantly between regions such as the United States, the European Union, and parts of Asia.
      In the USA, Hamamelis virginiana distillate (commonly referred as witch hazel water) is an over-the-counter (OTC) product regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is officially listed in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and is widely used in topical applications for minor skin irritations, insect bites, and hemorrhoidal relief. Cosmetic formulations containing witch hazel—toners, cleansers, and aftershaves—are classified as cosmetics under FDA regulation, provided that they do not exhibit any therapeutic effects, but act as an astringent ingredient [99,100]. 
      In the European Union, witch hazel preparations can be used as a traditional herbal medicinal product (THMP) under Directive 2004/24/EC or as cosmetic products under Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009. Examples of THMPs include creams, rectal suppositories or liquid preparations for the treatment of minor inflammatory conditions of the skin. Regulatory assessment is carried out by national agencies or by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In addition, the leaves and bark extracts of H. virginiana are registered for their cosmetic use in the European Cosmetics Ingredients database (CosIng) as astringents, skin and hair conditioners, and soothing ingredients [41,42,101]. 
      In Asia, legal regulations are more dependent on the region and country. In countries like Japan, witch hazel extract is primarily used in the cosmetics industry, especially in facial care products. These products are regulated as quasi-drugs or functional cosmetics, depending on the national legislation of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) [102]. For instance, witch hazel water is approved as a skin-conditioning agent. In China, products containing H. virginiana may fall under the regulatory oversight of the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) [103], with the most recent focus predominantly being on the botanical ingredients of cosmetics, supporting the consumers demand for “clean beauty” solutions in these products. However, the formal recognition of using witch hazel in these regions as a traditional medicine is limited.
    
    
      5. Conclusions
      Our study showed that Hamamelis virginiana (witch hazel) demonstrates a wide range of biological activities that support its use in dermatology, particularly regarding skin health. Extracts from its bark and leaves show antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and wound healing properties. It is effective against various bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains, and fungi like Candida, with synergistic effects alongside antibiotics. Clinical studies support its use in eczema, acne, UV-induced erythema, and sensitive scalp conditions. Hamamelis also promotes wound healing by modulating enzymes, reducing oxidative damage, and stimulating skin cell growth. Its antioxidant properties protect skin from oxidative stress and pollution. Taken together, current scientific evidence confirms the relevance of H. virginiana as a traditional herbal remedy. Its multifunctional bioactivity, wide availability, and favorable safety profile position it as a promising candidate for integration into modern dermatological and cosmetic formulations. The future potential of witch hazel lies not only in its traditional uses but also in novel applications supported by rigorous scientific validation. Therefore, despite these promising findings, several areas require further investigation.
      The molecular mechanisms responsible for the biological effects of H. virginiana are worth investigating, with particular emphasis on the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways. Clarifying which signaling cascades are selectively activated or suppressed by its bioactive compounds could contribute to the identification of specific molecular targets. This knowledge would not only help explain its pharmacological actions—such as its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or antimicrobial effects—but could also aid in optimizing therapeutic applications and minimizing potential side effects. Variability in extract composition highlights the necessity for standardized extraction protocols and comprehensive phytochemical profiling. It is also worth including the flowers of this interesting plant in future studies, as they may prove to be a valuable source of beneficial phytochemicals. Additionally, while environmental and geographical factors are known to influence the phytochemical content of many medicinal plants, there are currently no published studies examining whether the efficacy or composition of H. virginiana extracts vary depending on the cultivation region. Addressing this gap could provide valuable insights for optimizing cultivation practices and ensuring consistent therapeutic quality. Furthermore, although preliminary clinical results are encouraging, larger and well-controlled trials are essential to confirm efficacy in specific skin conditions. Moreover, long-term safety and toxicity profiles of different formulations, especially at higher concentrations, remain insufficiently explored. Research into optimal delivery systems, such as emulsions and hydrogels, to improve the bioavailability of active compounds in topical applications is also warranted. Lastly, further studies on synergistic or antagonistic interactions with conventional antibiotics and skincare agents are critical to inform effective combination therapies. 
      In conclusion, H. virginiana represents a multifaceted natural agent with significant potential for skin health and is deserving of continued translational and clinical research to fully harness its therapeutic benefits.

Body: 1
      Introduction
      Currently, there is growing attention to skin rejuvenation because of the increase in people's life expectancy [1]. Skin aging is a complicated process that includes intrinsic (chronological) aging and extrinsic aging (e.g., sun, gravity, sleeping positions, and smoking). In both types of aging, there is a decrease in elastin, collagen, and loss in hydration leading to dryness and atrophy, with fine wrinkling in the skin [2, 3]. Fibroblasts, the predominant population responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, are the primary cause of skin senescence [4, 5].
      So far, researchers have extensively studied skin rejuvenation and proposed strategies for reducing skin aging, one of which is nanotechnology. Recent research shows that Fe3O4@CQDs significantly reduce ROS and inhibit pro‐inflammatory cytokines like TNF‐α and IL‐1β, addressing oxidative damage and aging pathways [6, 7]. Studies indicate that nanotechnology enhances cosmetic effectiveness by increasing capture efficiency, controlling drug release, improving physical stability, increasing moisturization, and enhancing ultraviolet (UV) protection [8].
      As more people become interested in natural cosmetics, Oleuropein, a phenolic substance found in olive leaves (
Olea europaea
), has been shown to have multiple skin advantages in clinical studies [9, 10, 11]. This secoiridoid has a special ability to change how different mechanisms of skin aging interact, such as oxidative stress, inflammasome activation, and the degeneration of the ECM [12, 13]. Studies show that it is able to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS), lower the levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines including IL‐1β and IL‐6, and boost collagen production through pathways that are mediated by VEGF [14, 15]. Oleuropein increases collagen synthesis and inhibits matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade skin collagen and elastin [10, 11].
      Also, studies have shown that vitamin C is one of the compounds that affects skin rejuvenation. Vitamin C neutralizes free radicals and increases collagen, but Oleuropein does better in the role of removing ROS [16] while also inhibiting IL‐1β and caspase‐1‐mediated inflammasome activation, which is associated with both oxidative stress and inflammation [16]. Oleuropein is stable in formulations, unlike vitamin C, which degrades quickly [17]. Based on research, Retinol enhances skin texture but induces inflammation and necessitates the avoidance of UV exposure, whereas Fe3O4@CQDs decrease inflammation without impairing barrier function, and their magnetic targeting minimizes systemic exposure [18, 19]. In contrast to hyaluronic acid or niacinamide, which disperse widely, Fe3O4@CQDs improve spatial accuracy by concentrating active ingredients in photoaged or inflammatory regions [8, 20, 21].
      Another strategy for decreasing skin aging is exosomes, which have recently attracted significant attention as a therapy for skin rejuvenation [22]. Exosomes, a category of skincare agents, are increasing in popularity in the cosmetics industry because of their therapeutic and rejuvenating characteristics. They contain proteins, lipids, nucleic acids like microRNAs, and other compounds, which promote healing, hydration, and skin health. Exosomes can be modified by manipulating the culture medium or cell content and can repair skin damage such as sunburn and acne scars. They also contain bioactive compounds that protect the skin from environmental influences and minimize dark spots [23, 24, 25, 26]. On the other hand, microRNAs are one of the most major molecules present in exosomes [27]. MicroRNAs have been shown to have various activities in skin aging after differentially expressed microRNAs were identified based on the results of microRNA sequence analysis [28].
      Recent clinical trials and research have shown that both unmodified and modified (engineered) exosomes, particularly those sourced from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and fibroblasts, are efficacious in skin rejuvenation, wound healing, and enhancement of barrier function [29, 30, 31]. Also, exosome‐based creams represent an innovative method in cosmetic dermatology, proving efficacy in skin rejuvenation, hydration, pigmentation correction, and wound healing [31, 32].
      Research findings suggest that multiple signaling pathways play a role in the process of skin aging. Insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF1) is a key protein that stimulates keratinocyte growth [4]. Many downstream signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and MAPK, are phosphorylated as a result of IGF1 activation of the insulin‐like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) [33]. IGF1 activates the PI3PK/AKT pathway, prevents dermal fibroblasts from UV‐B‐induced programmed cell death, and promotes cell survival via the MAPK pathway [34]. Also, epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a mitogenic polypeptide. It can activate and multiply myofibroblasts through the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways [35, 36]. EGF has a bright future in cosmetic antiaging applications because it plays an important role in upregulating fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis in the skin [37].
      The present study aimed to utilize modified exosomal content with treated Oleuropein and Fe3O4@C/Oleuropein to modulate the expression of genes (IGF1, IGF1R, EGF, COL1A1, and ELN) and microRNAs (hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, hsa‐let‐7e‐5p, and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p) related to IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K pathways on the HFFF2 cells (in vitro) in order to reduce the aging process in the skin.

Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein Synthesis
        Fe3O4 (Cas No 1309‐37‐1; US Research Nanomaterials Inc., USA) nanoparticles (1 g) and d‐glucose (0.5 g: a compound of carbon origin) were suspended in 60 mL of distilled water, and the suspension was sonicated for 30 min. Subsequently, using the hydrothermal method, the suspension was incubated at 180°C for 5 h to synthesize Fe3O4@CQD in the Hydrothermal Autoclave. Thereafter, the synthesized Fe3O4@CQD was separated by centrifugation at 2000 g for min. After washing with water and ethanol, the samples were dried using a freeze dryer. In the following, 1 g of dried Fe3O4@CQD and 0.1 g of Oleuropein (32619‐42‐4; Sigma‐Aldrich, Germany) were suspended in 50 mL of distilled water and stirred by a shaker for 24 h to make Fe3O4@CQD/Oleuropein. Finally, the Fe@C/Ole NPs were gathered, washed, and dried using a freeze dryer.

          Characteristics of Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein Synthesis
          The synthesized Fe@C/Ole and functional groups of the particles were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy. The assay was carried out using an FTIR (SHIMADZU, Japan) device in a wave range of 500–4000 cm−1. X‐ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was used to assess the physical phase and crystal structure of Fe@C/Ole (CuKα, radiation, λ = 0.154056) at a scanning speed of 2° per minute (2θ range from 10° to 80°). Additionally, the size range, morphology, and aggregation level of the synthesized Fe@C/Ole were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (TESCAN MiRa3).

        hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells suspensions were seeded in a 96‐well culture plate, and after incubation for 24 h, hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells were treated with a gradient concentration of Fe@C/Ole (0–1000 μg/mL) and Ole (0–2000 μg/mL). The plates were incubated for 24 and 48 h. Next, the medium was removed, and MTT (2‐(4,5‐dimethythiazol‐2‐yl)‐2,5‐diphenyltetrazolium bromide) solution (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added. After incubation for 4 h, the contents of the wells were removed and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the wells (the assay was repeated three times). The IC50 and IC25 were calculated by measuring the absorbance of the formazan crystals at a wavelength of 570 nm (Awareness Microwell Plate Reader Chromate 4300, USA).

        3.1
        Physicochemical Properties of Fe3O4
@CQD/Oleuropein
        The FT‐IR spectra of Fe3O4, Ole, Fe3O4@CQD, and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole are shown in Figure 1. The functional groups of the synthesized nanoparticles were identified. The strong band at 3350–3500 cm−1 confirmed the O‐H stretching bond of the phenolic part of Ole and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole. The peaks at approximately 500–600 cm−1 correspond to Fe‐O bonding, confirming the presence of Fe3O4 in the structures of Fe3O4, Fe3O4@CQD, and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole. Fe3O4@CQD and Fe3O4@CQD/Ole exhibited a C=O stretching band at 1710 cm−1, signifying the presence of Fe3O4‐CQD. C–H stretching vibration signals were observed at 2920 cm−1. The characteristic vibration of the carbonyl groups in the Ole molecule was responsible for the signals observed at 1720 cm−1. The signal appeared at 1597 cm−1 as a stretching vibration and 1386 cm−1 as a bending vibration belonging to the functional groups C = C and O‐H, respectively. These results indicated the presence of Ole in Fe3O4@CQD/Ole (Figure 1A). The XRD pattern of Oleuropein attached to magnetite nanoparticles. All the signals in this pattern match the information from the standard XRD pattern of magnetite nanoparticles and confirm the crystallinity of the nanoparticles (Figure 1B). Fe3O4 nanoparticles with a spherical spinel structure showed signals at (311), (220), (440), (511), (422), and (400). The absence of (110) (2θ = 21.220) and (104) (2θ = 33.150) signals indicates that neither goethite (α‐FeOOH) nor hematite (α‐Fe2O3) phases were formed in the samples. Additionally, the binding of Oleuropein does not change the structure of Fe3O4@CQD; a broad peak is observed between 2θ = 12–28, which pertains to the overlap between Oleuropein and Fe3O4@CQD (Figure 1B). The morphology and size of the nanoparticles were determined using field‐emission scanning electron microscopy (FE‐SEM) technique. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the sample revealed a range of particle sizes, ranging from 30 to 80 nm. Therefore, the image illustrates that the particles of the sample ingredients exhibited a high degree of homogeneity and possessed a consistent, symmetrical, and uniform distribution (Figure 1C).

        The effects of different concentrations of Ole on the viability of HFFF2 and hUC‐MSCs were studied (Figure 3B). The amount of the IC50 was estimated at 1035.4 μg/mL for the HFFF2 cells and 977.43 μg/mL for hUC‐MSCs; cell treatment was performed utilizing IC25 ≃ 500 μg/mL for cell treatment as an effective concentration. In summary, the results showed that Ole has cell inhibition and toxicity in very high concentrations (IC50 ≃ 1000 μg/mL), whereas Fe@C/Ole has them in low concentrations (IC25 ≃ 500 μg/mL).

          The exosomes isolated size from hUC‐MSCs treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and the control group were 68.8 ± 4.82, 58.3 ± 4.49, and 41.3 ± 3.03 nm, respectively, and the exosomes isolated size from HFFF2 cells treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and the control group were 67.3 ± 4.80, 42.6 ± 3.04, and 35.5 ± 2.82, respectively in the DLS analyses (Figures S1 and S2; Table 1). Z‐potential of the isolated exosomes was found to be −21.8 and −21.3 mV, which indicates the stability of exosomes in hUC‐MSCs treated with Ole and HFFF2 treated with Ole, respectively (Figure S3).

          Western Blot Analysis
          In the western blot image, protein bands with a size of 26 kDa indicated exosome membrane protein CD63 (Figure 4A,B). The protein CD63 was present in the Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control groups in both the hUC‐MSCs and HFFF2 cells. Furthermore, the presence of protein bands at 24 kDa implies the existence of the exosome membrane protein CD9, as depicted in Figure 4C,D. We detected CD9 protein in the hUC‐MSCs, HFFF2 cells, and control group.

        In Silico Analysis of microRNAs Related to Studied Genes
        In silico analysis was performed to determine and confirm the selection of microRNAs associated with the studied genes, as detailed in Table 2. Specifically, for the IGF1 gene, hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p were identified. The IGF1R gene was associated with hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p. The EGF gene was linked to hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p. For COL1A1, hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7d‐5p were confirmed. Lastly, hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p was associated with the ELN gene (Table 2).

          3.6.1
          The Relative Gene Expression Treated With Fe@C/Ole and Ole
          In the ANOVA test, significant differences were observed between the treatments (Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control) in the HFFF2 cells, in terms of the relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes (p ≤ 0.05). Also, in the hUC‐MSCs, there was a significant difference in the relative expression (p ≤ 0.05) of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A, and ELN genes between the treatments. In contrast to other genes, no significant difference was observed in the relative gene expression of EGF in the hUC‐MSCs between the treatments (Table S3).
          The HFFF2 cells exhibited significant upregulation in the expression of the IGF1 (fold change: 3.14), IGF1R (5.3), COL1A1 (2.11), ELN (3.17), and EGF (3.5) genes in response to Ole treatment compared to the control group. Additionally, Fe@C/Ole treatment upregulated the expression of the IGF1R (2.03), ELN (1.94), and EGF (2.76) genes compared with the control group; however, there were no significant changes in the IGF1 and COL1A1 genes in the Fe@C/Ole group compared with the control group (Figure 5A). This trend of gene expression changes was similar in hUC‐MSCs, although, as mentioned, the EGF gene was not significant, and, unlike the HFFF2 cells, the COL1A1 gene was upregulated in the Fe@C/Ole treatment (Figure 5B).

          The Relative Gene Expression in Exosome‐Treated HFFF2 Cells
          According to the qRT‐PCR data and analysis of variance, there was a significant difference between HFFF2‐derived exosomes and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, and control treatments in terms of the relative expression of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF genes (p ≤ 0.05) in HFFF2 cells (Table S4).
          The findings indicated that the relative expression levels of IGF1 (2.6, 6.14), IGF1R (3.02, 6.11), COL1A1(3.73, 4.25), ELN (2.5, 3.25), and EGF (4.06, 4.14) were strongly upregulated in the HFFF2 cells treated with HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes with Ole compared to the control group, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Also, the results showed that the relative expression levels of IGF1 (3.4, 5.62), IGF1R (3.9, 6.02), COL1A1 (2.24, 3.32), ELN (2.4, 3.4), and EGF (3.61, 4.12) were significantly upregulated in the HFFF2 cells after the treatment of HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes with Fe@C/Ole compared to the control group, respectively (Figure 6A,B). Overall, the effects of HFFF2‐derived and hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes were similar; however, the effect of exosome treatment on gene expression was more significant than that of direct treatment with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to the control group.

          In the ANOVA, significant differences were observed between the treatments (Table S5). The results showed that hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs were significantly downregulated, whereas miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated in HFFF2‐derived exosome content, as well as in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosome content treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to the control (Figure 7A,B).

The present study evaluated the amounts of different microRNAs in HFFF2 cells treated with HFFF2‐derived exosomes and in hUC‐MSC‐derived exosomes in comparison to the control. The results indicated that the hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs were downregulated in HFFF2 cells between the treatments. In contrast, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p was upregulated between treatments in HFFF2 cells (Figure 8A,B).

          Expression Correlation of microRNAs

          Our investigation demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the expression levels of specific microRNAs in modified exosomal content and the associated alterations in HFFF2 cells treated with these exosomes. This finding supports the concept that exosomal miRNAs are conveyed to recipient cells and influence their gene expression.
          The study examined expression correlation of several microRNAs, including hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p, in HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole compared to exosomes of HFFF2 cells that were treated with exosomes derived from these cells. Significant positive correlations were consistently observed for these microRNAs in exosomes and exosomes of HFFF2 cells, indicating a robust influence on HFFF2 cellular responses. These results highlight the critical role of exosomes in intercellular communication and the regulation of gene expression within recipient cells (Table S7).

        Results of Exosome Toxicity Investigation
        The Flow Cytometry analysis results showed no significant variations in the viability percentage between HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole, Ole, or the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 9). Flow Cytometry analysis of cell death data, including late apoptosis and necrosis, revealed no significant differences between exosome treatments. However, the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole significantly increased early apoptosis (p ≤ 0.05); on the other hand, there were no significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) in early apoptosis between the HFFF2‐derived exosomes treated with Ole and the control in the HFFF2 cells (Figure 9).

      Discussion
      Previous research has revealed that the IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways are involved in skin rejuvenation [34, 35, 36, 37]. For these signaling pathways, we selected to investigate growth factors and their receptors, including the IGF1, IGF1R, and EGF genes, as well as the COL1A1 and ELN genes, which are primarily involved in skin renewal. Conversely, microRNAs modulate gene expression in the skin aging process. Research has identified multiple microRNAs linked to skin aging, which also target our chosen genes, notably the hsa‐miR‐29, hsa‐miR‐34, and hsa‐let‐7 families [49]. Research has shown that IGF1 is regulated by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [39] and hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [40]; IGF1R is targeted by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [41], hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [42], hsa‐let‐7d‐5p [43], and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p [43]; EGF is regulated by hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [44]; COL1A1 is targeted by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [45], hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p [46], and hsa‐let‐7d‐5p [47]; and ELN is regulated by hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p [48].
      Aging causes an increase in MMPs and a reduction in Collagen (COL1A1) and Elastin (ELN) levels [50, 51]. Thus, enhancing the production of Collagen (COL1A1) and Elastin (ELN) can effectively mitigate the effects of aging and promote rejuvenation [51, 52]. This study revealed that Ole and Fe@C/Ole (slow release) treatments increased COL1A1 and ELN mRNA levels in HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs that support the hypothesis of skin rejuvenation through treatments, as MMP9 (nonreported) has the ability to degrade collagen and elastin. Results were anticipated given the proven efficacy of Ole in many signaling pathways, including IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K [13, 53]. The effect of Ole can be attributed to its antioxidant effects, as well as its influence on the expression of growth factors such as IGF1 and EGF [10, 54, 55]. Generally, in our study, Ole treatment upregulated the expression of IGF1, EGF, and IGF1R, but IGF1 was not significant in Fe@C/Ole treatment (Figures 5 and 6). To date, reports have shown that antioxidant treatments, such as Ole, quercetin, and resveratrol, increase the expression of IGF1, EGF, and IGF1R genes [56, 57].
      The nanocomposite structure can improve Ole's stability and activity by preventing degradation in biological fluids. This is crucial for maintaining therapeutic levels during treatment [58]. Ole's effect on enhancing these growth factors and their receptors has been examined by targeting the MAPK signaling pathway [53, 59], which supports the rejuvenation process by inhibiting MMPs and promoting the production of COL1A1 and ELN (Figure 11). Furthermore, previous studies have highlighted Ole's ability to activate the PI3K signaling pathway and its significant antioxidant effects [60]. This pathway is known for its antioxidant properties; by increasing the expression of antioxidant cascades within the cell's nucleus and mitochondria, it actively inhibits the aging process [61]. Additionally, reducing MMP activity and blocking inflammatory pathways—such as those involving prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), nitric oxide (NO), and interleukin 6 (IL‐6)—promotes the synthesis of collagen (COL1) and elastin (ELN) (Figure 11).

      In fact, our investigation involved treating HFFF2 cells with exosomes derived from both HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs, all of which had been pre‐treated with either Ole or Fe@C/Ole. This approach led to an observable increase in the expression of several key genes: IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF (Figure 11). This outcome aligns generally with findings from direct Ole therapy, with the notable exception of the EGF gene's response in hUC‐MSCs. Interestingly, whereas direct treatment of HFFF2 cells with Fe@C/Ole did not significantly alter the expression of IGF1 and COL1A1 and similarly for EGF and IGF1 in hUC‐MSCs, a significant upregulation was observed when these cells were instead treated with exosomes originating from HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs that had undergone Fe@C/Ole pre‐treatment. This suggests that the reduced toxicity of Fe@C/Ole when delivered via exosomes appears to have notably increased gene expression within the exosomes themselves, a significant improvement compared to direct application. Utilizing modified exosomal content offers distinct benefits over conventional treatments. Primarily, these modified exosomes do not trigger the body's antibody and antigen systems, thus avoiding an immune response. Secondly, their internal components are directly influenced by the initial treatment, as these exosomes are typically derived from living cells [22, 62]. Furthermore, both Ole therapy and Fe@C/Ole application substantially altered the makeup of the exosomes, leading to observable changes in their modified content. Exosomes also exhibit remarkable anti‐inflammatory properties, which contribute to accelerated healing, a reduced risk of EGF complications such as post‐inflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring, and improved results in photo rejuvenation by enhancing collagenases and promoting the proliferation of dermal fibroblasts [63, 64].
      On the other hand, this investigation focused on microRNAs linked to genes involved in the IGF1, EGFR, MAPK, and PI3K signaling pathways. We assessed how Ole and Fe@C/Ole treatments affected the levels of exosomal microRNAs in HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs, given their known association with growth factors and genes critical for skin rejuvenation. The findings indicated that a 24‐h treatment influenced the expression levels of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs in exosomes. The changes in Ole and Fe@C/Ole treatments resulted in the downregulation of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs in exosomes derived from HFFF2 cells and hUC‐MSCs. Downregulation of hsa‐miR‐29b‐3p, hsa‐let‐7d‐5p, and hsa‐let‐7e‐5p microRNAs as interfering RNAs justified the upregulation of IGF1, IGF1R, COL1A1, ELN, and EGF gene expression (Table 2). These observations were corroborated by the expression of the aforementioned genes within HFFF2 cells, subsequent to their treatment with HFFF2‐derived exosomes that had undergone pre‐treatment with Ole and Fe@C/Ole (Figure 6). This research demonstrates a clear alignment between the microRNA levels found within the exosomes and those present in the HFFF2 recipient cells influenced by these exosomes. Consequently, modified exosomal content, produced through Ole and Fe@C/Ole therapy, emerges as a practical substitute for directly treating cells. These tiny vesicles hold considerable benefits when compared to traditional topical facial applications, positioning them as a more effective therapeutic choice [65, 66].
      Unexpectedly, overexpression of hsa‐miR‐34a‐5p in exosomes treated with Fe@C/Ole and Ole and also exosomes of HFFF2 cells that were treated with exosomes derived from these cells indicates a complex role in skin aging responses. It enhances skin repair by promoting cell turnover and healthier epidermal layers, regulates oncogene‐suppressing pathways to prevent skin deterioration, and induces apoptosis to clear damaged cells, supporting new cell generation. Additionally, it modulates genes vital for tissue repair, boosting collagen and elastin synthesis for improved skin youthfulness. These effects collectively enhance skin self‐renewal, underscoring its potential in antiaging research [67, 68, 69, 70].
      This study provides novel insights into the regenerative properties of modified exosomal contents, indicating that Ole and Fe@C/Ole in exosome‐based therapies hold great promise for skin rejuvenation. In addition, this study offers important insights into the effects of Ole and Fe@C/Ole on cellular mechanisms, and it is important to understand that the experiments were performed in vitro using cell lines. Applying these findings to in vivo conditions, such as human skin, could require more studies. The intricacies of the human body, including factors such as skin thickness and blood circulation, may affect the efficacy and potential side effects of Ole or Fe@C/Ole‐based treatments.

      Conclusion
      The research findings indicate that the use of modified exosomal content with Ole and Fe@C/Ole (slow release) treatment is a more effective method for transferring substances and biomolecules that are effective in the molecular mechanisms of skin rejuvenation than the use of effective substance treatment alone in vitro. This method can ultimately increase collagen and elastin gene expression while reducing interfering microRNAs in their respective genes.

      Introduction
      Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing health care at breakneck pace with capabilities never previously seen in diagnosis, treatment suited to the unique individual, and back‐end productivity [1]. From machine‐learning software that identifies tumors on X‐rays to natural language processing software that enables automated clinical documentation, AI is augmenting human knowledge, reducing errors and costs. Its capacity to process enormous data sets—from genomic profiles to real‐time monitoring of patients—makes predictive analysis and precision medicine possible, essentially transforming the way care is given [2]. With increased adoption, its impact is also spreading beyond the realm of conventional medicine to specialist areas such as dermatology, plastic surgery, and cosmetic treatment, where its potential for innovation is immense but complex [3].
      Aesthetic medicine, a medical specialty focused on enhancing physical appearance through minimally invasive or nonsurgical methods, is all about symmetry, proportion, and patient satisfaction [4]. These include procedures such as Botox, dermal fillers, laser work, and body contouring intended to address aging, skin wellness, or congenital asymmetry, often marrying medical expertise with artistic sensibility [5]. In contrast to general medicine, aesthetic medicine takes place at the interface of science and personal ideals of beauty, so practitioners need to reconcile technical competence with an appreciation of individual patients' wishes [6]. This specific context makes the domain highly susceptible to AI incorporation because technology can leverage objectivity, customization, and results while negotiating intricate aesthetic values [7].
      AI is revolutionizing aesthetic medicine by facilitating data‐driven treatment planning, predictive analytics, and hyper‐personalized patient experiences—but its adoption presents significant ethical and technical challenges [8]. Algorithms now power virtual simulations of postprocedure outcomes, recommend personalized skincare routines, and assist robotic instruments in performing precise interventions [3]. But issues such as biased training data, patient privacy, and overautomation need careful scrutiny [9]. As the field evolves, stakeholders must harmonize AI's transformative potential with safeguards to ensure equitable, transparent, and human‐centered care in this deeply personal domain [10].
      
        1.1

Identify key challenges—spanning ethical concerns, regulatory gaps, and technological limitations—that hinder responsible AI deployment. Propose actionable strategies to balance innovation with human‐centric care, emphasizing transparency, inclusivity, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
      
      
        1.2
        Research Problem
        The rapid integration of AI into aesthetic medicine has outpaced critical evaluations of its ethical, technical, and societal implications. While AI offers transformative tools for facial analysis, personalized treatments, and outcome prediction, challenges such as algorithmic bias, data privacy risks, and overreliance on automation threaten patient safety and equity. The field lacks standardized guidelines to govern AI adoption, creating disparities in care quality and eroding trust in technology‐driven interventions.
      
      
        1.3
        Significance of the Study
        The significance of this study lies in its capacity to guide the responsible development of AI technologies in an area where subjective standards of beauty and objective medical practice converge. By bridging critical gaps in regulation, fairness, and clinical practice, the research aims to create guidelines that promote patient well‐being while harnessing the transformative power of AI. Findings will be most helpful to active practitioners seeking to incorporate AI utilities into practice, developers designing aesthetic tools, and lawmakers who formulate suitable regulatory frameworks. Ultimately, the current investigation enhances the discourse at the population level around medical AI by bringing clarity on certain distinct concerns relevant to aesthetic medicine, where innovation facilitated through technology is weighed precariously with considerations around artistic appreciation as well as patient welfare.

      Methodology
      This narrative review synthesizes qualitative insights from peer‐reviewed literature, industry reports, and clinical case studies (2015–2024) to explore AI's role in aesthetic medicine. Using thematic analysis, we evaluate key applications (e.g., facial simulation, robotic surgery), ethical challenges (bias, privacy), and emerging trends (AR/VR integration, genomics). Sources were selected from PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and dermatology journals, prioritizing high‐impact studies and paradigm cases that illustrate AI's transformative potential and limitations. The analysis emphasizes critical discourse around human–AI collaboration, regulatory gaps, and patient‐centered outcomes, offering a comprehensive yet interpretive assessment of the field's evolution.
      
        2.1
        Understanding AI in Aesthetic Medicine
        AI is computer applications designed to accomplish tasks that generally require human intellect, such as decision‐making, pattern recognition, and image interpretation [11]. Machine learning in AI enables algorithms to improve over time with experience without programming, and computer vision enables computers to interpret and analyze visual data, such as images or video [12]. Deep learning, a subset of ML, uses multi‐layered neural networks to process complex data—like facial features or skin textures—with remarkable accuracy [13]. Together, these technologies form the backbone of AI's capability to mimic and augment human expertise, particularly in fields requiring precision and adaptability [14].
        In aesthetic medicine, AI is relevant because it can improve precision, personalization, and automation [15]. Facial symmetry and skin conditions are examined by computer vision algorithms with pixel‐perfect precision, allowing clinicians to craft treatments specific to individual anatomies [16]. Machine learning models examine patient histories, genetic information, and lifestyle variables to forecast best results for procedures such as filler injections or laser treatments, providing hyperpersonalized care [17]. And as automation streamlines workflows—from AI chatbots booking appointments to robotic equipment assisting in minimum invasions—the practitioner is then free to fret about innovative and complex tasks. This triple threat of precision, customization, and automation makes AI the game‐changer force in a field where art and medical science converge [18].
        Adoption trends in the present day are looking at increased adoption of AI in every kind of aesthetic treatment. Technology like 3D facial mapping software, virtual “before‐and‐after” planners, and AI‐powered skin diagnostic apps (like Haut.AI or Perfect Corp) are now the norm at clinics, streamlining patient consultations and treatment planning [19]. Startups and established technology firms such as Canfield Scientific and ModiFace, which is owned by L'Oréal, are working with physicians to develop platforms that read aging patterns or forecast surgical outcomes [20]. Adoption varies globally, with technologically advanced regions such as South Korea and the United States leading AI‐assisted robotic surgeries and tele‐aesthetics, while regulatory hurdles in the European Union and elsewhere restrain adoption. Despite challenges, the trend is toward AI as an indispensable tool, reshaping patient and clinical expectations in aesthetic medicine (Figure 1) [21].

      Application of AI in Aesthetic Medicine
      
        3.1
        Facial Analysis and Simulation
        AI has revolutionized facial analysis and simulation in aesthetic medicine by offering clinicians objective tools to evaluate symmetry, age pattern prediction, and 3D modeling of patient anatomy [22]. Facial landmarks are analyzed with sophisticated computer vision algorithms to identify asymmetry or disproportions, enabling clinicians to design treatments to restore balance—for example, dermal fillers or botulinum toxin injections [23, 24]. Deep learning algorithms predict how a patient's characteristics may age in the future and guide preventative interventions. Additionally, 3D modeling and AR allow patients to visualize possible outcomes of procedures like rhinoplasty or cheek enhancement in interactive “before‐and‐after” virtual reality simulations [25]. These technologies are used by platforms like ModiFace or Crisalix to optimize patient–clinician communication, create realistic expectations, and optimize satisfaction by bridging the gap between artistic intention and achievable results (Figure 2) [27].
        
          FIGURE 2

        3.2
        Personalized Treatment Planning
        Computer‐optimized personalized treatment planning is a break from the past one‐size‐fits‐all approach to hyperindividualized treatment. Machine learning algorithms analyze diverse data points—skin type, genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and past treatment histories—to recommend optimal treatments, either laser treatments for pigment or fillers to round out [28]. For instance, AI‐driven software like Haut.AI analyzes skin texture and moisture levels to deliver customized skincare regimens, while tools like Allergan's SkinMedica utilize predictive analytics to match patients with appropriate chemical peels or serums. Data‐driven precision minimizes trial‐and‐error, decreases side effects, and keeps interventions aligned with personal aesthetic needs and biological factors [29].
      
      
        3.3
        Robotic‐Assisted Procedures
        AI‐based robotic systems are enhancing the precision and safety of aesthetic surgery, particularly for repetitive or detail‐oriented procedures [30]. In hair transplantation procedures, for instance, systems like the ARTAS Robotic System utilize computer vision to identify and harvest healthy follicular units with submillimeter accuracy, minimizing scarring and maximizing graft survival rates [31]. Similarly, AI‐guided lasers in skin resurfacing dynamically modulate energy levels in real time based on tissue response, optimizing efficacy while protecting surrounding areas [32]. These systems reduce human error, standardize outcomes, and allow surgeons to focus on advanced decision‐making, marrying robotic precision with human creativity to redefine procedural excellence (Figure 3) [34].
        
          FIGURE 3
          
            ARTAS robotic system for hair transplant [33].
          
          
        
      
      
        3.4
        Patient Outcome Prediction
        Predictive analytics based on AI are transforming risk analysis and outcome prediction in aesthetic medicine. By analyzing previous data from thousands of cases, algorithms predict how a patient will respond to procedures such as filler injections or liposuction based on variables like skin elasticity, healing capacity, and metabolic rates [35]. As an example, AI models may offer probability estimates of such complications as delayed swelling or asymmetry, enabling clinicians to adjust techniques or recommend alternative procedures. Such forward‐looking risk management not only enhances safety but also trust in patients through congruence of expectations with evidence‐based probabilities, encouraging informed consent and satisfaction over time [36].
      
      
        3.5
        Enhanced Patient Experience
        AI is transforming the patient experience with intelligent tools that make interactions more efficient and insightful [37]. Chatbots and virtual assistants, like those embedded in clinic websites, offer 24/7 availability for booking consultations, addressing preprocedure questions, or monitoring recovery through symptom‐checking algorithms. Following procedures, AI‐powered apps deliver personalized aftercare reminders and monitor healing progress through photo submissions that are assessed using computer vision [38]. Education websites leverage generative AI to create patient‐friendly content, simplifying complex procedures like thread lifts or microneedling into simple terms through interactive videos or infographics. These features reduce administrative burdens on staff, empower patients with knowledge, and offer a seamless, easy experience from consultation through recovery (Table 1) [39].

      Challenges and Ethical Considerations
      
        4.1
        Data Privacy and Security
        The use of AI in aesthetic medicine raises serious concerns about the privacy and security of sensitive patient information, particularly biometric data such as 3D facial scans, skin texture analysis, and genetic data. These data are highly personal and vulnerable to breaches, particularly when stored or processed by third‐party platforms. Unauthorized access can lead to identity theft, discrimination, or misuse of images for unethical purposes (e.g., deepfakes) [40]. Compliance with regulations like GDPR and HIPAA is critical, yet it is still possible to have loopholes in the acquisition of cloud‐based AI software and end‐to‐end encryption. Clinics must introduce robust cybersecurity measures and open data governance for maintaining patient confidentiality while harnessing the power of AI [41].
      
      
        4.2
        Bias and Algorithmic Fairness
        Aesthetic medicine AI systems can perpetuate bias if they are trained on unrepresentative data. For instance, algorithms trained on predominantly lighter skin tones can misdiagnose conditions like hyperpigmentation in darker‐skinned patients, leading to suboptimal or even harmful recommendations [42]. Similarly, facial symmetry models would be founded on Western beauty standards, ignoring ethnic variation. Biases such as these devalue equity and potentially amplify disparities in the quality of care. Addressing this requires curation of diverse and inclusive training datasets, routine algorithmic review, and multidisciplinary participation in AI design, including ethicists and sociologists, to ensure that tools treat all patient groups equally [43].
      
      
        4.3
        Overreliance on Technology
        Whereas accuracy is enhanced by AI, excessive dependence on algorithmic recommendations can work against clinical judgment. Aesthetic medicine is inherently one of personal choice—that is, balancing a patient's ideal with anatomical potential—calling for human intuition and empathy [44]. Excessive automation might lead to formulaic treatment with indifference to psychosocial or cultural concerns. For example, an AI could be set to prefer measurements of facial symmetry to a patient's personal idea of beauty [45]. Clinicians must learn to control, using AI as a tool to support decision‐making rather than a replacement for judgment, and acquire skills to critically analyze and interpret insights offered by AI [46].
      
      
        4.4
        Regulatory Hurdles
        The swift development of AI in aesthetic medicine has been ahead of regulatory guidelines, leading to uncertainty regarding safety and efficacy standards. In contrast to drugs or medical devices, AI algorithms tend to develop dynamically, making it difficult for conventional approval procedures [47]. Regulatory agencies such as the FDA and EMA are establishing guidelines for AI/ML‐based software, but there are inconsistencies between regions [48]. For instance, a virtual simulation tool that has been approved in a country can be legally limited elsewhere due to differences in data privacy laws or clinical validation needs [49]. Global standardization and clear channels for tracking real‐world performance are required to ensure innovation while safeguarding patient health [50].
      
      
        4.5
        Patient Trust and Transparency
        Building patient trust in AI‐supported aesthetic therapy relies on transparency about the contribution of algorithms to decision‐making. Patients are generally unaware that AI is being utilized in their therapy or may perceive it as impersonal or intrusive [51]. Clinicians must clearly define the purpose, limitations, and risks of AI algorithms—for example, that a virtual simulation constitutes a probability, not a guarantee. Informed consent processes should disclose data use and algorithmic involvement [52]. Furthermore, “black box” AI systems, which are unexplainable, can be barriers to trust. The use of interpretable models and educating the patient encourages collaboration, making the individual feel empowered rather than disconnected by technology in their aesthetic process (Table 2) [53].

      Future Directions
      
        5.1
        Integration With Emerging Technologies
        The union of AI and augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and wearables will soon revolutionize patient experience and care delivery in aesthetic medicine [54]. AR/VR platforms, such as immersive consultation platforms, allow patients to “try on” the likely outcomes of procedures like facelifts or lip augmentation in real time, facilitating informed decision‐making [55]. Surgeons can utilize VR simulations to plan complex interventions, overlaying AI‐generated 3D mappings of anatomy onto a patient's physical features for precision [56]. Meanwhile, wearable technology with AI, be it smart patches or rings, monitors skin moisture, UV levels, or collagen levels in real time and enables anticipatory adjustments to skincare routines or treatments. These technologies integrate physical and virtual experiences, transforming consultations into in‐depth data, two‐way conversations, and allowing patients to actively participate in their aesthetic treatment [57].
      
      
        5.2
        Advancing Precision Medicine
        AI is also releasing the promise of genomics and biomarkers to introduce precision into aesthetic treatments [58]. By analysis of genetic data linked to skin elasticity, wound healing, or susceptibility to pigmentation disorders, algorithms are able to predict individual responses to treatments like laser therapy or microneedling. AI models, for example, can identify patients who are likely to form keloid scarring, whereupon less invasive treatments would be indicated by clinicians [59]. Startups like SkinDNA and Nutrino employ AI to interpret genetic and metabolic profiles in order to design tailored regimens for anti‐aging or acne management [60]. This shift from generalized protocol to biology‐driven customization ensures interventions are aligned with a patient's unique physiological blueprint, maximizing efficacy and minimizing risks [61].

        Ethical AI Development
        As AI increasingly plays a central role in aesthetic medicine, ethical practices in development are necessary to reduce harm and achieve fairness. Building diverse datasets is done by intentional engagement with various groups to obtain representative skin tones, ethnic features, and age distributions—overcoming conventional biases of training data [62]. Transparent algorithms built with explainable AI (XAI) frameworks allow clinicians and patients to visualize how the recommendations are produced, increasing accountability [63]. Tools like IBM's AI Fairness 360 provide open‐source technology to audit and correct for bias. Ethicists, technologists, and clinicians must collaborate on creating standards that prioritize patient well‐being above business considerations and that result in AI tools maintaining dignity and cultural sensitivity as goals for pursuing beauty [50].
      
      
        5.4
        Global Collaboration
        The complexity of AI integration necessitates cross‐border and cross‐sectoral cooperation to strike a balance between innovation and safety [64]. Players in the industry, such as Google Health and Perfect Corp, a startup, are collaborating with plastic surgeons and dermatologists to screen AI solutions for skin diagnosis or virtual modeling [65]. Concurrently, regulatory bodies such as the FDA and WHO are developing standardized testing protocols for AI‐enabled devices, balancing against rapid innovation and stringent regulation [66]. International networks, for example, the International Aesthetic Surgery Innovation Network, provide access to sharing information on best practices, stewardship of data, and ethical frameworks [67]. These networks ensure AI advancements to be scalable, culturally sensitive, and evidence‐driven, bridging the gap between innovative technology and real‐world use [68].

AI in Preventative Aesthetics
        AI is shifting the focus of aesthetic medicine from repair to prevention by the identification of early signs of aging or skin damage. Predictive models analyze longitudinal data—lifestyle patterns, environmental exposures, and serial imaging—to forecast issues like collagen loss or hyperpigmentation prior to them being visibly apparent [69]. Apps like SkinVision use AI to assess moles for the risk of melanoma [70], while others like Olay's Skin Advisor examine selfies to recommend preventive skincare [71]. When these features are integrated with telehealth, clinicians are able to catch conditions earlier and offer individualized advice on sun avoidance, nutrition, or procedures that are minimally invasive. This forward‐looking strategy not only enhances long‐term outcomes but positions aesthetic medicine in concert with broader trends in preventive medicine, oriented toward wellness instead of overreactive intervention [72].

      Discussion
      AI use in aesthetic medicine is a paradigm shift in clinicians' assessment, planning, and delivery of treatments [22]. The article highlights the revolutionary impact of AI in many aspects of practice, ranging from facial analysis and customized planning to robot‐assisted treatment and predictive modeling. The benefits are vast but accompanied by an array of challenges that need to be considered seriously to enable ethical and effective integration [23, 24].
      One of the most powerful strengths of AI is its ability to enhance diagnostic precision and objectivity [32]. Deep learning and computer vision technologies now outperform traditional visual inspection in the identification of facial asymmetries, skin conditions, and aging signs. This has resulted in more precise and reproducible treatment strategies. In addition, the introduction of 3D simulations and augmented reality has improved patient‐practitioner communication, balancing aesthetic expectations with realistic outcomes [27].
      These technologies do more than improve clinical judgment; they extend the limits of what may be perceived, creating a better and wiser consultation process [38].
      Another urgent innovation is hyperpersonalized treatment planning. Computer algorithms, through analyzing massive pools of information—genetics, lifestyle, and history of treatments—enable clinicians to shift beyond cookie‐cutter protocols to biological‐based treatments [28]. This reduces side effects, amplifies efficacy, and facilitates patient‐centered care. Still, the quality and representativeness of training data remain essential. If datasets are not representative of different ethnicities, ages, and skin colors, the produced AI products will unintentionally reinforce biases and create disparities in care quality [29].
      The application of AI‐powered robotic systems has also improved procedure consistency, particularly in long or precision‐based procedures like hair transplantation and laser resurfacing [32]. Not only do these systems deliver maximum technical performance, but they also allow clinicians to spend more time on higher level decision‐making and artistry. However, the arrival of such automations brings with it fear of reliance on technology, which could undermine the clinician's input to subjective aesthetic judgment—a domain where human experience and empathy cannot be replaced by anything else [34].
      Predictive analytics provide a further level of advantage, enabling practitioners to foresee likely treatment outcomes and potential complications. This application enhances risk stratification and promotes transparency in patient counseling [35]. However, many AI devices remain “black boxes,” providing answers but with minimal knowledge of how the decision was reached. This absence of transparency has the potential to undermine patient trust and clinical accountability, especially in elective procedures where expectations are by nature subjective and emotionally laden [36].
      In general, the regulatory and ethical landscape for AI in aesthetic medicine remains under development [46]. Cybersecurity and data protection remain at the forefront, particularly with the sensitive nature of facial images and biometric data. Regulatory frameworks, such as the FDA's evolving SaMD guidelines for software as a medical device, are beginning to address these shortcomings, but as yet, no global standardization exists. With continued advancements in AI technologies, there is an ever‐growing need to embrace harmonized worldwide regulation, open validation protocols, and performance monitoring in the field [45].
      Also, transparency and patient education are essential to the building of trust in AI‐based care. Clinicians must explain how AI systems aid in treatment planning, as well as their limitations and probabilistic nature [50]. Combining XAI systems and ethical regulation can close the gap between high‐tech capability and patient understanding, facilitating informed consent and shared decision‐making [63].
      In the years to come, the convergence of AI with technologies such as wearable sensors, genomics, and virtual/augmented reality could further expand the realm of aesthetic medicine [70]. These developments enable preventative approaches, which allow early detection and intervention before clinical evidence of aging is evident. For this to be optimized, however, ongoing multidisciplinary effort among clinicians, engineers, ethicists, and regulators has to be continued [72].
      Briefly put, AI will enhance aesthetic medicine through greater accuracy, individualization, and prognostic treatment. Its introduction must be founded on ethical considerations, universal design, and continued clinical observation. Discovering an optimal synthesis of technological innovation and the irreplaceable human aspects of aesthetic practice will be crucial to making AI an enabler rather than a displacer.

      Conclusion
      AI is unequivocally transforming aesthetic medicine, delivering innovative facial analysis tools, personalized treatment planning, robotic precision, and predictive patient care. From AI‐powered simulations that enhance consultations to genomics‐driven skincare regimens, these innovations are reshaping beauty, safety, and efficacy standards. As the specialty further evolves, however, concerns regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and regulatory gaps must be proactively addressed to ensure ethical and equitable use. We must have a shared call to action—clinicians, technologists, regulators, and ethicists must collaborate together to promote responsible innovation. Investment in diverse AI development, robust regulatory frameworks, and patient education will be instrumental in guiding this technological revolution. Clinics and developers must invest in transparency so that AI augments—rather than replaces—the human touch that remains at the center of aesthetic care. Ultimately, the future of aesthetic medicine is about achieving a balance—harnessing the analytical capability of AI without sacrificing the artistry, empathy, and customized judgment that characterize the specialty. By synthesizing innovative technology with human‐focused values, the field can create unparalleled opportunities, with advancements working not only toward aesthetic ideals but overall patient health. The path forward is as much about advancement as it is about integrity, sculpting a future where beauty and technology unfold together.

Title: FFA Patient Profile Analysis Based on the Authors’ Observations and a Review of the Literature—An Original Survey

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is a scarring alopecia with an unclear aetiology, primarily affecting postmenopausal women. This study aims to identify potential risk factors contributing to FFA development and progression, as well as provide a clinical profile to aid in the differential diagnosis. Methods: The study included 19 women diagnosed with FFA. The participants completed a 20-question survey based on a literature review of potential risk factors. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the associations between patient characteristics and FFA. Results: All patients were female and their mean age was 60.58 years (SD = 12.81). In 63.1% of the cases, FFA onset occurred postmenopause, with a mean latency of 8.17 years. In the majority of cases, the diagnostic delay exceeded five years. The average menarche age was 13.68 years (SD = 2.06), whereas late menarche (≥15 years) was found in two subjects. A history of reproductive organ or breast malignancy was reported by 42.1% of the patients, which frequently required surgery. Most subjects did not receive hormone replacement therapy, or hormonal contraception. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypothyroidism (89.47%). Although smoking was rare among the subjects, hair colouring was quite common, yet no participant underwent scalp aesthetic procedures. In 47.4% of cases, scalp itching or pain was present. Sunscreens were frequently used, mostly on a daily or seasonal basis. Conclusions: FFA predominantly affects women in their early 60s, often following the menopause. In our study, a tendency toward an early menopause and an above-average menarche age of the subjects was observed. In the analysed group, only reproductive and breast cancers were reported, which requires further investigation. Frequent β-blocker use, second only to levothyroxine, may suggest that they play a role in FFA pathogenesis. Itching and pain of the scalp may contribute to the correct diagnosis, although these symptoms are not universal. Moreover, sunscreens were indicated as a potential trigger, yet avoiding them should not be routinely recommended due to the risk of carcinogenesis. The variability in the diagnostic delay emphasises the need for increasing clinician awareness and conducting further research.

Body: 1. Introduction
      Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) represents a rare and relatively recently recognised disease, first described in 1994 by Steven Kossard [1,2]. It is a progressive form of scarring hair loss, characterised by hair loss predominantly in the frontal and temporal scalp regions [3]. Although it primarily affects postmenopausal women, FFA was also reported in men and premenopausal women [4,5]. The condition presents with specific symptoms of frontal hairline recession, scalp inflammation, scaling and perifollicular erythema, which contribute to its distinctive clinical presentation [6].
      Despite its increasing prevalence, the exact cause of FFA remains unclear and involves a complex interplay of genetic predispositions, hormonal influences, and environmental factors [7]. There are a number of controversial and frequently conflicting hypotheses with regard to the disease aetiology [8]. Currently, the literature highlights significant gaps in the understanding of FFA pathogenesis, where certain studies suggest potential links to autoimmunity and androgen-related mechanisms, whereas other emphasise environmental triggering factors, such as the use of sunscreens and particular cosmetic products [9,10,11,12,13,14]. FFA is now considered a patterned clinical variant of lichen planopilaris (LPP), an autoimmune disease mediated by folliculotropic cytotoxic T-cells targeting the hair follicle epithelium. Additionally, the diagnostic process may be challenging due to the clinical and histopathological similarities with other scarring alopecias, and therefore requires a thorough clinical evaluation, trichoscopy, and—in some cases—a scalp biopsy [15,16]. Contrary to overt clinical scarring, the fibrotic changes seen in FFA often manifest as subtle, pale, featureless skin, reflective of histological fibrosis rather than gross dermal remodelling. These conflicting viewpoints indicate the need for further research to elucidate these associations in order to fully determine its aetiology and exact nature, and thus improve the diagnostic as well as therapeutic processes available for FFA patients.
      The objective of this study is to describe the profile of a typical FFA patient and thereby assist clinicians with the diagnostic process, which in most cases remains complex. Moreover, by using patient-reported data, it also attempts to explore potential links between FFA and various environmental factors in order to clarify key correlations and gain insights into the pathogenesis of FFA.
      By means of integrating the clinical and patient perspectives, our research seeks to enhance the understanding of this condition and ultimately improve clinical outcomes for the affected individuals. This paper also provides an overview of the current knowledge regarding FFA, addresses the diagnostic challenges, as well as offers relevant insights for both practitioners and researchers.
    
    
      2. Materials and Methods
      The survey was conducted at the Department of Dermatology at the Heliodor Swiecicki Hospital (Poznan University of Medical Sciences Clinical Hospital) between May 2023 and May 2024, and involved patients suffering from frontal fibrosing alopecia who were referred for a dermatology consultation.
      The eligibility criterion was the diagnosis of frontal fibrosing alopecia and treatment at the Department of Dermatology at Poznan University of Medical Sciences. All subjects agreed to participate in the study and provided a written consent. The research was approved by the Bioethics Committee of Poznan University of Medical Sciences (approval number 304/23, 6 April 2023). 
      The diagnosis of FFA in all included patients was established by experienced dermatologist based on a combination of clinical, trichoscopic and histopathological criteria, in accordance with current international diagnostic guidelines. Trichoscopy was performed in all cases and in every case revealed findings characteristic of FFA. In selected cases, a confirmatory scalp biopsy was conducted demonstrating histopathological hallmarks of FFA and supporting the clinical and trichoscopic diagnosis.
      The participants were asked to fill out the original questionnaire, which contained 20 questions created by the authors on the basis of the latest literature review, regarding the factors which affected the development of FFA. A literature search was based on the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, and included studies published between 2005 and 2025.
      The format of the questionnaire comprised yes/no and open-ended questions, which pertained to menstruation, duration of the condition, oncological diseases, administered medications, treatments used—i.e., aesthetics medicine procedures on the scalp or hair colouring—as well as the patients’ smoking habits and sunscreen use. Ultimately, 19 subjects were included in the study.
      The patient questionnaire used in this study is provided in Supplementary Materials File S1.
      The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 28. Due to the small number of participants, only the frequency analysis was applied.
    
    
      3. Results
      Our study comprised 19 patients, aged 31 to 75 years (M = 60.58; SD = 12.81) and diagnosed with FFA. The largest group, which included 9 subjects in their 60s (between 61 and 68 years of age), accounted for 47.3% of the analysed group. All participants were female.
      At the time of the survey, 15 patients (78.9%) stated that they had already had their last menstrual period, whereas in only 4 (21.1%) subjects the menopause had not started yet. One of the participants, a 33-year-old woman, had undergone a hysterectomy with the removal of one ovary and therefore, for statistical purposes, she was included in the postmenopausal group. Once the aforementioned patient was excluded, the age of the subjects during their last menstruation ranged between 47 and 58 years (M = 51.47; SD = 6.21). Most women experienced the menopause at the age of 50 (N = 4; 21.1%), and the largest number of patients within this group entered the menopause between 50 and 55 years o (N = 9; 47.4%).
      In the case of 12 patients, constituting 63.1% of the analysed group, the first symptoms of alopecia appeared after the menopause. Another 7 individuals (36.9%) had been premenopausal when first symptoms occurred; however, at the time when the study was conducted, 3 of them (15.8%) were already postmenopausal, while 4 patients (21.1%) experienced menstrual cycles both at the time of the first symptoms and throughout the study.
      As for the symptoms that developed in the patients following the menopause, they appeared between six months and even up to 20 years following the last period. The mean interval between the menopause and the first symptoms of alopecia was 8.17 years (SD = 6.68).
      Notably, only one patient (5.3%) was correctly diagnosed with FFA at her first medical appointment. The highest percentage of patients (N = 4; 21.1%) received an appropriate diagnosis one year after the onset of alopecia symptoms; however, in a significant proportion of the patients, the time until the proper diagnosis was considerably longer. The diagnosis of FFA was established after 5 years or more in 8 patients (N = 8; 42.2%) (M = 5.45; SD = 7.17), and the longest period from the onset of the symptoms to the diagnosis amounted to 27 years.
      The patients in our study entered menarche at ages ranging from 9 to 17 years (M = 13.68; SD = 2.06). The largest group (N = 7; 36.8%) experienced the first menstruation at the age of 14; the next most numerous group (N = 4; 21.2%) started menstruating at the age of 15. Moreover, 2 participants (10.5%) in the study group reported menarche over the age of 15—both were 17, which could be considered a late menarche. The majority of the analysed individuals (N = 13; 68.4%) indicated the first menstruation above the age of 13. Only one patient (5.3%) started menstruation at the age of 9, which could be classified as early menarche. Interestingly, the majority of our patients menstruated regularly (N = 15; 78.9%), whereas only 4 subjects (21.1%) showed irregular menstruation.
      The majority of the surveyed women could not provide the age at which their closest female relatives entered menopause (N = 10; 52.6%). In one case, the youngest family member experienced the menopause at the age of 42, whereas the oldest experienced it at the age of 55. The mean age for menopause in the family of the analysed female patients was 49 years of age (SD = 4.44).
      In the studied group, 15 (N = 15; 78.9%) participants were pregnant at least once, while 4 (N = 4; 21.1%) subjects had never conceived. The number of suies ranged from one to five, and the majority of the respondents were pregnant twice (N = 10; 52.6%). Only one pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage, and it involved a patient who had been pregnant twice.
      The majority of the studied group had no history of cancer, although 8 (N = 8; 42.1%) patients listed various types of cancer or precancerous conditions in their medical history. The reported types of cancer and their frequency are presented in Table 1.
      More than half of the participants in our study (N = 11; 58.2%) had undergone at least one surgical intervention, which predominantly comprised gynaecological procedures. Several patients had been subject to more than one type of procedure. The surgical procedures and their frequency are summarised in Table 2.
      In the case of one patient diagnosed with breast cancer, the treatment included mastectomy, as well as radio- and chemotherapy with tamoxifen.
      Most patients had not received hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (N = 15; 78.9%); however, 4 subjects (N = 4; 21.1%) reported using HRT in the form of oestriol tablets (N = 1; 5.3%), oestradiol transdermal system (N = 1; 5.3%) and soya bean extract tablets (N = 1; 5.3%). One patient did not specify the medication she took. The duration of HRT administration among the participants varied from 6 months to over 20 years.
      The majority of the studied group did not take hormonal contraception (N = 12; 63.2%). Of the 7 patients (N = 7; 36.8%) who did, 5 used birth control pills (N = 5; 26.3%), 2 used intrauterine devices (N = 2; 10.6%), and 1 patient (5.3%) was unable to answer the question regarding the form of hormonal contraception she had received.
      Furthermore, 17 subjects (N = 17; 89.47%) suffered from other diseases apart from FFA. According to the analysed data, the majority of the surveyed women suffered from hypothyroidism. The frequency of the most common comorbidities is presented in Table 3.
      Other medical conditions in the studied group included the following: insulin resistance, angina pectoris, tachycardia, peripheral venous insufficiency, gastrointestinal motility disorders, hepatic steatosis, cerebrovascular disorders, vertigo, as well as osteoarthritis, allergies to dust and mites, and cataracts.
      The patients were also requested to provide information as to which medication they were currently using. Only 3 individuals (N = 3; 15.8%) were not taking any drugs, whereas 1 patient did not specify which hypertension medication she received. Levothyroxine was the most commonly administered medication and it was prescribed as a treatment for hypothyroidism in 10 patients (N = 10; 52.6%). In turn, 6 patients (N = 6; 31.6%) reported taking statins, including 4 who received rosuvastatin (N = 4; 21.1%) and 2 who used simvastatin (N = 2; 10.5%). One patient used a dietary supplement containing red yeast rice, policosanol, folic acid, coenzyme Q10 and astaxanthin. Several participants received medication for hypertension, where β-blockers represented the predominant drug class (N = 4; 21.1%) and included bisoprolol (N = 3; 15.8%) and metoprolol (N = 1; 5.3%). In total, 5 patients (N = 5; 26.3%) reported taking diuretics (in the form of a single or combination drug), including 3 (N = 3; 15.8%) subjects using indapamide, which is classified as belonging to the sulphonamide group, and 2 (N = 2; 10.5%) participants who received hydrochlorothiazide in combination with losartan, which belong to the thiazide and sartan groups, respectively. Another 3 (N = 3; 15.8%) patients received calcium antagonist medications, among whom 2 (N = 2; 10.5%) individuals were administered lercanidipine and 1 (N = 1; 5.3%) patient used lacidipine. One participant (N = 1; 5.3%) received ramipril, which is one of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Other less frequently administered drugs included metformin, ivabradine, calcium dobesilate, trimebutine, pantoprazole, timonacicum, vinpocetine, flunarizine and betahistine.
      None of the studied patients reported undergoing any medical or aesthetic procedures on the scalp, such as hair transplants, prior to the onset of scarring alopecia symptoms. Furthermore, the majority of the subjects (N = 14; 73.7%) admitted to dying their hair, as compared to 5 (N = 5; 26.3%) individuals who denied using hair colouring products. As for unusual or aggressive hair treatments, such as hair extensions or frequent use of high-temperature styling devices (e.g., straighteners, curlers), they were reported by 5 (N = 5; 26.3%) respondents. Specific treatments included keratin treatments (N = 1; 5.3%), frequent or occasional straightening (N = 2; 10.6%), as well as regular styling with high-temperature appliances, such as thermal rollers (N = 2; 10.6%).
      In terms of tobacco smoking, the vast majority of the participants indicated that they had never smoked in the past (N = 15; 78.9%). In turn, 3 (N = 3; 15.8%) patients were current smokers and 1 (N = 1; 5.3%) patient was a former smoker.
      Itching or scalp pain was noted by 9 (N = 9; 47.4%) patients, whereas 10 (N = 10; 52.6%) subjects did not experience these symptoms.
      Sunscreen use was reported by the vast majority of the respondents (N = 15; 78.9%), with SPF values fluctuating between 10 and 100. Among the patients who used sunscreens, 6 (N = 6; 31.6%) women applied SPF 50, 5 (N = 5; 26.3%) participants opted for SPF 30, 1 (N = 1; 5.3%) subject reported using SPF 20, 1 (N = 1; 5.3%) patient—SPF 10, and 1 (N = 1; 5.3%) respondent—SPF 100. Additionally, there was also 1 patient who did not remember which SPF value she used. The frequency of using sunscreen was as follows: 7 (N = 7; 36.8%) patients used sunscreen daily, 8 (N = 8; 42.1%) respondents used sunscreen seasonally during the summer, and only 4 (N = 4; 21.1%) participants did not use sunscreen at all.
    
    
      4. Discussion
      Our findings confirm that scarring alopecia primarily affects postmenopausal women in their early 60s, consistent with previous studies [17,18]. It is rarely observed in men [19] and is considered a condition primarily found in postmenopausal women [20] at a mean age of 62–64 years [21], which aligns with our results.
      The mean age of menopause in our cohort aligns with that reported for Caucasian women in industrialised countries, typically between 52 and 55 years [22]. None of the patients experienced menopause before age of 45, which is considered early and has been identified as a risk factor for FFA [23].
      Our results support previous findings showing that FFA symptoms typically appear after the last menstruation [24], with onset occurring 2 to 12 years postmenopause, and a mean latency of 5.5 to 10 years [25].
      Notably, FFA was correctly diagnosed at the first medical visit in only one case, while for many patients the diagnostic process took considerably longer. This variability may reflect differences in clinical presentation as well as the age and experience of the physicians involved. Hence, it seems essential to conduct further research to understand the relationship between these factors.
      These observations highlight the need for further research on FFA to improve diagnosis, treatment, and clinician awareness—particularly among dermatologists. This seems even more relevant considering the increasing global prevalence of this rare entity [9,26].
      Menarche typically occurs between ages 10 and 16, with a mean of 12–13 years [27]. It is considered early before age 10 and late after age 15 [28]. Our analysis suggests that patients with FFA tend to experience menarche at the upper end of the normal range or later. As no comparable data were found in the literature, our study may be the first to explore this aspect, though larger cohorts are needed to confirm this observation.
      Interestingly, most participants reported regular menstrual cycles. While this may seem unexpected—given that irregular cycles may indicate excessive androgenic activity, which contribute to the development of such conditions as female pattern hair loss (FPHL)—androgens may also play a partial role in FFA pathogenesis [29]. Irregular cycles are associated with increased severity of various dermatological disorders, e.g., acne and atopic dermatitis [30]. However, our findings align with studies suggesting that FFA and follicular scarring may result from androgen deficiency, including low levels of androstenedione, DHEA-S, and DHEA, which regulate PPAR-c receptors involved in TGFB1-mediated scarring [31,32,33].
      The mean age of menopause onset in close relatives of the patients was not only lower than that of the FFA group but also below the population average [34]. Notably, one relative experienced menopause before age 45, meeting the criteria for early menopause [35,36]. Previous studies indicate that early menopause is a risk factor not only for FFA development but also for earlier symptom onset [14].
      According to both our findings and other literature data, individuals with FFA are more likely to experience a late menarche and an early menopause [37]. However, this observation requires further research on a larger group of patients.
      We observed that a significant proportion of respondents reported a history of cancer, all of which involved reproductive organs or breast, and had undergone at least one surgical procedure. This association warrants further investigation, particularly as prior oophorectomy or hysterectomy have been identified as potential risk factors for FFA development [38,39]. Most surgeries in our group were gynaecological, including two hysterectomies and one ovarian cystectomy. Moreover, as shown by Moreno-Arrones et al. prior tamoxifen therapy significantly increases the risk of FFA (OR 14.89; 95% CI 2.42–91.68) [40].
      In our study, the majority of the participants did not receive HRT. Nevertheless, Moreno-Arrones et al. demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between HRT and FFA, possibly due to hormonal changes involving oestrogen and prolactin levels during treatment (OR = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.11–2.8) [41]. Moreover, Tosti et al. reported that 35.7% of FFA patients had been treated with oestrogen-based HRT at the onset of the disease [29], a finding that is consistent with our analysis, as the participants who received HRT were primarily administered medications containing various forms of oestrogens. These observations support the hypothesis that patients with FFA may be more likely to experience early menopause and consequently, seek hormone replacement therapy.
      Our analysis showed that most participants had not used hormonal contraception. However, the impact of oral hormonal contraception on the development of FFA remains disputed. Initially, due to their high androgenic index, they were suspected to contribute to androgenetic alopecia. Nonetheless, more recent data suggest that their oestrogen component may have a protective effect by promoting hair growth [40,42,43]. In our cohort, 2 patients reported using an intrauterine device (IUD), whereas Beundia-Castano et al. identified IUD use as a potential protective factor against FFA (OR = 0.22; 95% CI: 0.06–0.84) [40].
      We also observed a high prevalence of hypothyroidism among surveyed patients. Similarly, Moreno-Arrones et al. reported an increased incidence of autoimmune diseases, including hypothyroidism, in individuals with FFA—20.8% compared to 13.1% in controls (OR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.11–2.69) [41]. In another study by Valesky et al., co-occurrence of FFA and hypothyroidism reached 58%, significantly exceeding the rate observed in the general population (6–10%) [44]. Notably, hypothyroidism frequently co-occurs with other types of alopecia, such as alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, and telogen effluvium [45,46,47].
      Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia are common in this age group, and in our cohort, making it difficult to establish a direct link with FFA. Their co-occurrence may be incidental [48,49], although some studies report a frequent overlap with dyslipidaemia and hypertension in FFA patients [50,51].
      Although no drug-induced cases of FFA have been reported, β-blockers have been implicated as potential triggers of LPP [20]. In our study, they were the second most commonly used medication after levothyroxine. As FFA is considered a variant of LPP [52], a possible association with β-blockers cannot be excluded. Further studies on larger cohorts are needed to verify this hypothesis.
      Scalp aesthetic procedures are rarely recognised as direct risk factors for developing FFA. Nevertheless, several cases following surgeries such as hair restoration or facelifts have been reported [53], possibly due to IFNγ-induced immune privilege collapse, isomorphic reactions, or the Koebner phenomenon [54]. Although identifying potential triggers within such procedures is important, none of our patients had undergone them.
      Some studies suggest hair dye use as a possible environmental factor in FFA onset; however, evidence remains inconclusive [8]. Most of our patients used hair dye, while other studies reported significantly lower hair dye use in FFA patients compared to controls [53]. Nevertheless, these data provide no evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship [55].
      Although the role of heat and mechanical hair treatments in FFA remains unclear, some studies suggest they may cause scalp inflammation or follicle damage [56]. In our study, few participants reported using such treatments, suggesting they are unlikely primary causes of FFA.
      In view of the fact that smoking is associated with a systemic inflammation, it has been assumed to affect certain dermatological disorders; yet, its role in FFA remains unclear [21,23]. The low prevalence of smokers in our study suggests that it is not a major contributing risk factor.
      Our findings show that scalp symptoms, including itching or pain, represent frequent, although not universal, characteristics of FFA. The nearly equal distribution of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients reflects clinical variability. Nonetheless, symptoms like pruritus and pain remain minor diagnostic criteria described in the literature [57,58].
      The survey showed frequent sunscreen use among patients. Interestingly, certain products, especially those containing physical filters like zinc and titanium dioxide have been suggested as potential environmental triggers for FFA [34,41,55,59,60,61]. However, this association is controversial, as affected individuals may be more diligent about sun protection [59,62]. Given the lack of conclusive evidence for a casual link, routine avoidance of sunscreen in FFA patients is not recommended, especially in Caucasians with photodamaged skin, where sun protection reduces the risk of serious conditions like actinic damage and subsequent skin cancer [63,64].
      This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, the small sample size, due to FFA’s rarity and alopecia-related stigma, limits participant availability, so our findings should be viewed as descriptive and exploratory while provided percentages are meant to offer a general sense of trend rather than support definitive conclusions. Secondly, the single-centre design restricts generalisability and broad epidemiological conclusions. Additionally, reliance on self-reported, retrospective data introduces potential recall bias, although trained medical staff assistance was available during questionnaire completion and, wherever possible, key clinical variables were crossed-checked with available medical records to improve reliability. Diagnoses were based on clinical and trichoscopic criteria by an experienced dermatologist, but confirmatory scalp biopsies were performed only in selected cases, possibly limiting diagnostic certainty and allowing overlap with other cicatrical alopecias. Consequently, further multicentre studies with larger cohorts and routine histopathological confirmations are warranted to comprehensively assess potential risk factors and better elucidate the underlying aetiology of FFA.
    
    
      5. Conclusions
      Our study confirms that FFA predominantly affects postmenopausal women in their early 60s, who manifest a clear tendency for an early menopause and a higher-than-average age at menarche. Even though FFA remains a poorly understood condition, our findings corroborate the hypothesis that hormonal changes, primarily involving androgens and oestrogen metabolism, may play a role in the disease development. Furthermore, the high prevalence of hypothyroidism is indicative of a potential autoimmune component, and the exclusive occurrence of reproductive and breast tumours in our cohort warrants more-in-depth investigation. Additionally, frequent use of β-blockers raises the question of whether certain medications could influence the onset or progression of FFA. Among environmental factors, smoking appears insignificant, whereas hair dye use and widespread sunscreen application may represent potential disease triggers. However, our findings do not support routine sunscreen avoidance, given its role in photoprotection and cancer prevention. The clinical presentation of FFA varies, thus, rendering the diagnostic process complex and demanding. Scalp itching/pain is frequent, yet not universal; however, another significant challenge seems to be a delayed diagnosis. This, in turn, emphasises the necessity of raising awareness among practitioners in order to facilitate earlier detection and subsequent interventions, which may potentially mitigate the progression of the disease and improve treatment outcomes.
      In conclusion, our study provides valuable insights into the clinical profile and the potential risk factors contributing to the abovementioned goal. Nevertheless, due to the relatively small sample size, further large-scale, controlled, multicentre studies are crucial to confirm these associations, and to identify the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms especially the nature of LPP and its role in eliminating hair follicles. A multidisciplinary approach—incorporating dermatology, endocrinology, autoimmunology, as well as pharmacological and cosmetic research—may be the key to developing more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the future.

Title: Recommendations on Periprocedural Skincare for Energy-Based Dermatologic Procedures

Abstract: AbstractThe use of energy-based device (EBD) aesthetic skin treatments is increasing in popularity. Implementation of periprocedural skincare may improve treatment-related outcomes, reduce recovery time, and reduce the frequency and severity of potential side effects. This review presents treatment recommendations to assist clinicians in optimizing integrated skincare to enhance EBD treatment outcomes. A panel of Australian 6 physicians (5 dermatologists, 1 plastic surgeon) developed 4 generalized EBD periprocedural skincare recommendations. These recommendations were divided based on 4 levels of skin barrier disruption caused by EBD treatment: none (or minimal), mild, moderate, and severe barrier disruption. The greater the disruption caused to the skin barrier, the greater care needed in choosing appropriate skincare products with suitable actives. Preprocedural skincare incorporating moisturizers, broad-spectrum sun-protection factor 50+ sunscreen, antioxidants, and niacinamide should be implemented at least 2 weeks before treatment to enhance skin barrier function and hydration. Postprocedure recommendations are made for the use of appropriate skincare actives that promote barrier repair and avoid further irritation. Prescription actives should be avoided for an appropriate period following EBD procedures; this period is dependent on the EBD treatment type and degree of skin barrier disruption it can cause. The algorithms provided here are aimed to assist clinicians in optimizing integrated skincare recommendations to enhance EBD treatment outcomes, promote healing, and reduce the likelihood of adverse events. Skincare recommendations made to patients should be based on the condition of the patient's skin, as well as the magnitude of skin barrier disruption caused by the EBD procedure.Level of Evidence: 5 (Therapeutic)

Body: The use of energy-based device (EBD) aesthetic treatments is increasing, with the Australian skin laser market (ablative and nonablative) expected to grow by >6% by 2030.1 Common EBDs used for facial skin treatment include intense pulsed light, pulsed dye laser, 532 nm potassium-titanyl-phosphate, 1064 nm neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet, as well as several other infrared and fractional ablative and nonablative lasers.2 Although considered relatively safe, these EBDs are associated with side effects such as inflamed, swollen, itchy, or painful skin, acne, microbial infection, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), and scarring.3 The risk of PIH is greatest with ablative laser treatments and in darker skin types; 1 study found >90% of Asian people with Skin Phototype IV undergoing ablative fractional CO2 laser treatment developed mild PIH.4
    The integration of standard skincare procedures before and after EBD treatments has been shown to reduce treatment-related side effects and improve treatment outcomes.5,6 To date, little guidance is available in the literature for periprocedural skincare for EBD procedures. As such, there remains inconsistency in periprocedural skincare measures implemented across centers.2,5 The aim of this review is to provide periprocedural recommendations and algorithms, based on the opinion of a group of experienced Australian dermatologists and plastic surgeons, to guide the use of appropriate skincare with the aim of improving treatment-related outcomes, reducing recovery time, and reducing common adverse events. Recommendations have been stratified according to the degree of skin barrier disruption caused by EBD treatment. Recommendations were developed by the authors at a face-to-face workshop on the topic.
    
      SKIN BARRIER SUPPORT
      An intact skin barrier is essential in maintaining skin function and health. The skin barrier protects from physical, chemical, and microbial assaults and acts to prevent excess water loss.7 The outermost layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, is mainly responsible for effective skin barrier function. EBD procedures commonly cause skin barrier disruption to varying degrees. A delay in skin barrier repair can lead to persistent erythema, hyper/hypopigmentation, scarring, acne, and milia.3 It also increases the potential for bacterial, fungal, and viral infection, with the most common infectant being the herpes simplex virus.8 The risk of EBD procedure-related adverse events may be reduced through the implementation of a periprocedural skin care regimen that can reinforce and/or repair the skin barrier.9 The skin barrier protection effect of skincare products is dependent on factors such as the type and concentration of the active compounds used, as well as the composition of the formulation.
      Immediately following skin barrier disruption, increased absorption, and dermal delivery of skin actives can occur, such as for Vitamin C and tranexamic acid. The benefits of enhanced delivery post-EBD treatment are particularly observed for low molecular weight hydrophilic or water-soluble agents. The composition or formulation of skin care products applied postlaser treatment affects both the delivery and safety.
      A brief overview is given below of products recommended for use periprocedurally to provide barrier support and repair. In general, basic skin care, such as moisturizers and sunscreen, is very cost-effective and aid skin barrier healing. Active agents are usually more expensive, and their cost can vary greatly. Active agents such as retinoids, Vitamin B3, hyaluronic acids, and antioxidants are usually very affordable. Conversely, growth factors, stem-cell extracts, and peptides are premium-costed items.
      
        Lipids
        Skin barrier permeability is regulated by the intercellular lipid-enriched matrix of the stratum corneum, which is composed of ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol.10 As such, barrier dysfunction is partly attributed to reduced delivery of secreted lipids to the stratum corneum, leading to a decrease in the number of extracellular lamellar bilayers present.11 The clinical response to laser rejuvenation treatment has been attributed, in part, to differential lipid metabolism in the skin. Microarray analysis of skin biopsies from fast vs slow treatment responders revealed greater activation of lipid metabolism and keratinocyte differentiation in fast responders, who showed greater upregulation of acyltransferases, fatty acid elongases, fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, fatty acid desaturases, and specific keratins that may contribute to epidermal barrier function.12 Barrier restoration can be aided by the topical application of physiological lipids (eg, ceramides, fatty acids, and cholesterol), which have been shown to improve skin hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and total ceramide and cholesterol content in facial skin.7,13
      
      
        Moisturizers
        Moisturizers form the basis of daily skincare. As well as improving the appearance of skin, some moisturizer constituents can have therapeutic effects and facilitate skin barrier repair.14,15 Actives found in moisturizers are categorized into 4 groups, namely emollients, humectants, occlusives, and plasticizers.15 Most moisturizers combine emollients, occlusives, and humectants. Emollients, such as fatty acids, fatty alcohols, cholesterol, squalene, and pseudoceramides, improve skin barrier function, membrane fluidity, and cell signaling. Humectants are low molecular weight substances, such as urea, sorbitol, panthenol, glycerol, propylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, and alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), which increase water content in the stratum corneum. Occlusives are oils and waxes, such as mineral oil, petroleum jelly, beeswax, silicones, and zinc oxide, which form a physical layer on the skin preventing TEWL.
      
      
        Antioxidants
        Some EBD skin treatments, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), generate large amounts of reactive oxygen species. This is required for PDT therapeutic benefits, such as targeting precancerous skin cells or acne-causing bacteria. This also depletes the skin's antioxidant defenses and highlights the potential benefit of postprocedure antioxidant skin-targeted replacement to promote skin barrier repair and recovery.
        Antioxidants (eg, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, L-ascorbic acid, and ferulic acid) exert several beneficial effects, including the combat of free radicals, improved skin hydration, mitochondrial protection, and cell membrane support.16 In a study of 150 volunteers, treatment of skin with a topical antioxidant-containing cream improved epidermal thickness, elasticity, and skin moisture.17 In another double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 40 volunteers, the topical administration of the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin reduced photodamage and lipid peroxidation, and increased the surface lipids, skin hydration, and skin elasticity.18 Topical antioxidants are now widely used in the field of dermatology to promote skin barrier repair and improve barrier function. There is synergistic activity in combining multiple antioxidants, such as Vitamin C, Vitamin E, and ferulic acid. It is important to select stable formulation antioxidant products because formulation instability can lead to antioxidant degradation.
      
      
        Niacinamide
        Niacinamide (or nicotinamide) is a form of Vitamin B3 shown to improve stratum corneum barrier function. Niacinamide promotes the production of ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol in human keratinocytes of the stratum corneum.19 Topical niacinamide has been shown to increase the thickness of the stratum corneum of human skin by up to 10%.20 Topical niacinamide has also been shown to decrease TEWL and improve dry skin, reduce hyperpigmentation, improve photoaging and wrinkles, and reduce sebum production.19,21-25 Niacinamide, in combination with panthenol and madecassoside, was found to ameliorate various side effects following laser skin resurfacing procedures in 3 case reports.26 Additionally, niacinamide, in combination with tranexamic acid and kojic acid, was shown to enhance the laser treatment of melasma.27
      
      
        Retinoids
        Retinoids are a family of compounds derived from Vitamin A. Retinoids, such as retinol and tretinoin, have been used topically and systemically for decades for various skin conditions, particularly acne. Retinoids are thought to endow the greatest benefit when used before therapies that cause deep epidermal injury, rather than therapies that cause only superficial epidermal injury.28 Clinical studies have shown that the use of tretinoin before chemical peels, dermabrasion, and ablative and nonablative laser resurfacing improves subsequent procedural outcomes.28 Buchanan and Gilman have developed a treatment algorithm for tretinoin; preprocedural use of tretinoin has been recommended in ablative and nonablative laser facial resurfacing, surgical dermabrasion, and chemical peel resurfacing, with the tretinoin dose being dependent on the type of procedure.28 It is recommended that tretinoin is not started within 3 to 4 weeks before a resurfacing procedure because it can cause symptomatic dryness and exfoliation, as the facial skin has not yet had time to accommodate to its effects.28
      
      
        Botanicals
        Although the scientific evidence for the clinical efficacy of botanicals is often scarce, they have been used to treat skin conditions for centuries and still have a place in modern medicine. Botanicals often exhibit anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties, which are often combined in a single plant extract and may be based on several compounds rather than 1 single compound.10,29
        Plant oils are widely used on the skin for cosmetic and medical purposes because they elicit positive physiological benefits. Plant oils can be classified into essential oils (volatile at room temperature) and fixed oils (stable at room temperature). Both essential and fixed oils have been shown to improve barrier function. Plant oils, such as jojoba, soybean, and avocado oils, remain on the skin surface, thus acting as a barrier to maintain moisture and reduce TEWL.30 Essential oils are thought to only penetrate the most superficial layers of the skin, forming a film to improve the epidermal water balance and improve the hydrolipidic balance and thus skin hydration.31,32 Care should be taken with the choice of essential oils and their concentrations because some oils can have cytotoxic properties at high concentrations.32 Additionally, essential oils can have a risk of skin sensitization and allergic contact dermatitis.33 Rather than enhance barrier function, some monounsaturated free fatty acids, such as oleic acid, may enhance skin barrier permeability and enhance chemical permeability through the skin layers.34
        Cucumber extract is rich in vitamins, particularly Vitamins A and C.35 In addition to its cosmetic benefits to the skin, cucumber extract also exerts cooling, soothing, and healing effects on irritated skin.36
        
Aloe vera contains compounds such as salicylic acid, magnesium lactate, and gel polysaccharides and has wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pruritic properties.37  Aloe vera can also increase skin hydration.38
      
      
        Sun Protection
        The use of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun-protection factor (SPF) of 50+ is highly advisable before and following EBD procedures. For individuals with darker skin or prone to pigmentation, a sunscreen with broad ultraviolet A (UVA) protection (including filtration of long UVA wavelengths) is advisable, with or without the addition of a tinted sunscreen or a sunscreen with iron oxide for high-energy blue light protection. Adequate sunscreen protection is recommended to reduce the chance of pigmentation disorders, such as postprocedural melasma or PIH. The incidence of PIH can be high, estimated at 30% following laser skin resurfacing in people with Skin Phototype III and 90% in people with Skin Phototype IV.4,39
      
    
    
      SKINCARE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EBD PROCEDURES
      Four algorithms are presented, outlining integrated skincare recommendations for energy-based skin treatments (Figures 1-4). These recommendations are based on available literature and the opinion of experienced practitioners. Recommendations are stratified into 4 categories based on the degree of skin barrier disruption caused by treatments (none [or minimal], mild, moderate, or severe barrier disruption) and are divided into preprocedural skincare and postprocedural skincare. Special consideration should be taken for inflammatory skin conditions, which should be optimally managed by a qualified practitioner before EBD treatment. EBD procedures for people with skin conditions (eg, moderate-to-severe rosacea or acne, PIH) should be performed under the supervision of a dermatologist.

          Algorithm for the integrated facial skincare for energy-based device treatments that cause severe skin barrier disruption.
        
        
      
      
        Preprocedural Skincare
        The consistent application of moisturizers in the month leading up to EBD procedures is recommended for all skin types to optimize skin barrier function and hydration (Figures 1-4). The formulation choice of the moisturizer should be determined based on skin type, coexisting skin conditions, and consumer preference. Humectant moisturizers are recommended for people with rosacea and acne-prone skin to increase water content in the skin. Noncomedogenic moisturizers should be used for acne-prone skin. Moisturizers containing a combination of occlusives and humectants are advised to enhance the skin's water-retention capacity.40
        The use of antioxidants and niacinamide is recommended for all skin types to help maintain skin barrier integrity. It is also recommended that excessive sun exposure is avoided in the month leading up to EBD procedures. Physical protective measures, such as the use of wide-brimmed hats, should be implemented. The application of a broad-spectrum SPF50 or higher sunscreen is strongly recommended to prevent sun damage to the skin. Tinted sunscreens should be recommended for melasma- or PIH-prone skin to provide protection against visible light as well as UV light. Tinted sunscreens containing iron oxide have been shown to improve hyperpigmentation.41 The use of hydroquinone can also be considered for people with pigmentation, PIH, or existing melasma to lighten the skin and reduce the risk of melasma recurrence or PIH.
        For acne and acne-prone skin, the use of noncomedogenic products and hydrating moisturizers is recommended. Topical retinoids, AHAs, and beta hydroxy acids can be recommended to reduce inflammation, sebum production, and acne lesion formation.42
      
      
        Day of Procedure Skincare
        
          Immediately Preprocedure
          For optimal results, skin should be cleaned immediately before EBD treatment using appropriate cleansers able to remove makeup, sunscreen, and excess skin oils. An antimicrobial agent, such as chlorhexidine, isopropyl alcohol, or hypochlorous acid, is commonly used to sterilize the skin in order to reduce the chance of postprocedure infection.2
        
        
          Immediately (Within 24 h) Postprocedure
          Skincare requirements immediately after an EBD treatment are dependent on the type of EBD treatment used and the consequent degree of skin barrier disruption it can cause. Following EBD procedures that do not commonly cause any skin barrier disruption (Figure 1), good skincare incorporating a moisturizer, sunscreen as an absolute requirement, and antioxidants should also be advised to maximize improvements. Additionally, hyaluronic acid, peptides, and botanicals may be incorporated for appropriate patients. These agents act as additional moisturizing and messenger molecules and, in appropriate settings, may act synergistically with the EBDs used.
          Following EBD procedures that cause mild skin barrier disruption (Figure 2), the use of a thicker moisturizer, sunscreen, antioxidants (eg, ferulic acid), phloretin, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, panthenol, and pigment actives (eg, tranexamic acid) may all be used. Because mild disruption of the barrier has occurred, their access to deeper tissues is enhanced. Actives may be more potent in this scenario of barrier disruption; hence, the use of agents would be appropriate for use with broken skin.
          Following EBD procedures that cause moderate skin barrier disruption (Figure 3), agents should aim at efficacy but also to promote repair of the skin barrier. The use of antioxidants and peptides may be advantageously applied to increase their efficacy, whereas exosomes, stem-cell extracts, growth factors, and hypoallergenic botanicals (eg, cucumber extract) may also accelerate skin barrier restoration.
          Following EBD procedures that cause severe skin barrier disruption (Figure 4), the use of occlusive moisturizers may be necessary to act as a temporary artificial barrier, whereas exosomes, stem-cell extracts, growth factors, and peptides may accelerate the regeneration of the skin barrier, with further research needed to quantify this.
        
      
      
        Skin Aftercare
        Skincare requirements in the days to weeks following an EBD treatment are dependent on the type of EBD treatment used and the consequent degree of skin barrier disruption it can cause. Appropriate skincare following EBD procedures can both strengthen skin barrier function and enhance and maintain the results achieved by the EBD procedure.
        Following EBD procedures that do not usually cause any skin barrier disruption (Figure 1), a skin-type appropriate skincare routine, which includes a pH-balanced cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen, should be maintained. Prescription actives that the patient had been using before treatment can be continued as prescribed.
        Following EBD procedures that cause mild skin barrier disruption (Figure 2), a skincare routine comprised of a pH-balanced cleanser, neutral pH moisturizer (lotion or light cream with ceramides and glycerine), sunscreen, antioxidants, Vitamin B3, Vitamin B5, and hyaluronic acid is advised. The use of toners should be avoided because they can cause irritation and prolonged healing. The use of prescription actives should be avoided for 4 to 12 days postprocedure as some medicines, such as retinoids, AHAs, and hydroquinone, have been known to cause irritation and therefore may adversely impact healing.
        Following EBD procedures that cause moderate skin barrier disruption (Figure 3), a gentle cleanser and a richer cream-based moisturizer with ceramides, glycerine, petrolatum, and dimethicone can be used. Care should be taken to only use products tested for use on broken skin because there will be a higher risk of skin absorption following these EBD procedures. The use of toners, sodium-lauryl sulfates, and allergenics should be avoided to prevent irritation, increased inflammation, or sensitization. Caution should be taken with the use of irritating and prescription active ingredients, including retinoids, hydroquinone, and acids. These actives should be avoided for 2 to 3 weeks postprocedure in order to avoid any additional inflammation or irritation of the skin during the healing process.
        Following EBD procedures that cause severe skin barrier disruption (Figure 4), an occlusive moisturizer containing dimethicone or petrolatum is recommended. Dimethicone is a high-molecular-weight silicone. Because of its high molecular weight and hydrophobicity, dimethicone is poorly absorbed by skin, thus acting as a barrier to prevent water loss and the penetration of exogenous substances.43 Dimethicone is widely used for skin repair.44 The use of highly occlusive skin products, such as petrolatum, should be used cautiously on acne-prone skin, which may progress to acne breakout. Highly occlusive skin products may also cause milia; hence, they should only be used for up to 5 to 7 days post-EBD procedure. After this, a less occlusive moisturizer should be used. The use of irritating and prescription actives should be avoided for ≥24 days postprocedure or as determined by an experienced practitioner.
      
    
    
      LIMITATIONS
      The available evidence for the use of most skincare actives for facial EBD treatment is sparse, and mainly consists of studies with small sample size, making recommendations solely based on clinical evidence difficult. There is a need for more large randomized controlled trials in this area.
      The authors recognize that it is difficult to make generalized skincare recommendations because of the wide range of EBD treatments available. This is why recommendations were divided based on the degree of skin barrier disruption. These recommendations are general and may not suit everyone, especially in regions with broad ethnic skin color diversity and skin types, such as Australia. Therefore, clinician experience and discretion are paramount.
      The authors of this review are practitioners within Australia only, and their experience extends to this region. As such, recommendations presented should be considered within the context of individual regions.
    
    
      CONCLUSIONS
      A multimodal approach, which includes integrated skincare, is needed for the optimization of EBD treatment outcomes. The algorithms provided here are aimed to assist clinicians in optimizing integrated skincare recommendations to enhance EBD treatment outcomes, promote healing, and reduce the likelihood of adverse events. Skincare recommendations made to patients should be based on the condition of the patient's skin, as well as the magnitude of skin barrier disruption caused by the EBD procedure. The greater the disruption caused to the skin barrier, the greater care needed in choosing appropriate skincare products with suitable actives to promote barrier repair and avoid further irritation. Prescription actives should be avoided for an appropriate period following EBD procedures; this period is dependent on the EBD treatment type and degree of skin barrier disruption it can cause.

Title: Applied Research on APIA Scientific Skin Management Methodology: Enhancing Skin Health Through Personalized Approaches

Abstract: BackgroundCommon cosmetic skin concerns including dryness, acne, pigmentation, sensitivity, and ageing significantly impact quality of life. Traditional skincare methods often rely on generic strategies, overlooking the complexity and individual differences in skin problems. The APIA (Assessment, Program, Implementation, Accompany) skin management system is a proven, scientific and systematic skin health management programme that prioritizes personalized assessment and long-term tracking. APIA consists of four parts: Assessment (skin identification and analysis), Program (development of a skin management programme), Implementation (programme implementation), and Accompany (ongoing care).PurposeThis study aimed to explore and validate the application of the APIA methodology in skin management practice and its impact on skin health to offer new insights and practical recommendations for skin management practices.MethodsThis study employed a before-and-after comparative study design to evaluate the skin of 74 participants who were treated with the APIA methodology. The effectiveness of the APIA methodology was assessed by comparing skin metrics before and after its implementation. The assessment criteria included cosmetic and functional skin indicators, such as stratum corneum thickness, radiance, and sebum production.ResultsAfter implementing the APIA methodology, participants exhibited significant improvements in multiple skin indicators, including stratum corneum thickness, gloss, sebum secretion, pore blockage, capillary dilation, colour, softness, smoothness, elasticity, and temperature (p < 0.05). Additionally, improvements in self-perception, skin condition, acne, pigmentation, sensitivity, ageing, and skin around the eyes were statistically significant. There was no significant difference in pore size before and after management (p > 0.05).ConclusionThe APIA skin management methodology is effective at improving skin health and offers a scientific, systematic, and sustainable solution for skin care. This method can effectively address common skin problems and maintain the healthy state of the skin. It also has potential applications in the fields of cosmetology and skin health management.

Body: Introduction
      The skin is the largest organ of the body and serves as an important interface between the immune system and the external environment. It also provides a variety of physiological functions, including protection, regulation, metabolism and perception1 and plays a vital role in protecting against harmful external environmental factors and maintaining overall health. Healthy skin is also a key factor in normal human activities. In modern society, skin problems are becoming increasingly prevalent due to factors such as environmental pollution, ultraviolet (UV) exposure, work stress, misuse of skincare products, and unhealthy lifestyle habits. These problems not only affect appearance but also may cause psychological and social problems such as embarrassment, discomfort, and limited social activity and are even associated with psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression.2 Chronic skin problems may aggravate patients’ psychological stress, affect their quality of life and have a negative impact on their family and social relationships. Maintaining healthy skin is therefore not only about aesthetics but also about overall physical and mental health and social well-being.
      With advancements in beauty technology and the improvement of living standards, people’s pursuit of external beauty and internal health is also increasing. Skin management has become an increasingly important issue in daily life and work. However, the limitations of traditional cosmetic methods are gradually becoming apparent. These limitations underscore the need for a more personalized and scientifically grounded approach to skincare, moving beyond “one-size-fits-all” strategies and short-term focus. These approaches ignore the impact of lifestyle, such as diet, sleep, and stress management, on skin health3,4 and lack continuous follow-up and individualized adjustments. Therefore, it has become particularly urgent to develop a comprehensive and systematic approach for skin management (Table 1).Table 1Differences Between Skin Management Planning and Traditional Beauty ProgramsDimensionsSkin Management PlanningTraditional Beauty ProgramSkin Care System Composition- Comprehensive and systematic programme design- Characterized by progression and inevitability- Based on customer skin identification and analysis- Focused on achieving phased beauty goals- Single project of low relevance- Projects are relatively independent of each other, with no order of priority- Customers are randomly selectedTargeting- Tailor-made professional system solutions- Strongly targeted, customer beauty results-oriented- Process-oriented services- Poor targeting and customer autonomyService Results- Long-term protocol balancing short-term and long-term effects- Based on improving healthy skin function- Clear milestones to increase customer confidence- Enhances the professional confidence of practitioners and the reputation of beauty organizations- Short-term protocol mainly seeking short-term results- Failure to consider healthy skin function- Customers may give up when long-term results are unsatisfactory- Impact on practitioners’ professional confidence and institutional credibility
      In this context, skin management planning was developed. Skin managers utilize advanced technology to not only solve immediate skin problems but also prioritize long-term skin health management. Through a tailor-made systematic, comprehensive and long-term skin management plan, customers can, under the guidance of professionals, gradually establish a scientific concept of beauty care, rationally choose skincare products and treatments, effectively reduce the chances of developing skin problems, and achieve long-term health and rejuvenation of the skin. This approach not only enhances the external appearance of the skin but also prioritizes the support of skin’s intrinsic health, offering a novel perspective and direction for the field of skin management. This study aimed to investigate the application of the APIA method of skin management and its effects to provide new theoretical support and practical guidance for skin management practice.
    
    
      Methods
      
        Construction of the APIA Methodology for Skin Management
        The APIA skin management system is a standardized four-phase methodology developed for comprehensive skin health management. The acronym APIA represents the core operational stages (Figure 1):
Assessment (skin differentiation): Combines visual-tactile examination with instrumental measurements to establish baseline skin profiles, evaluating parameters including but not limited to stratum corneum thickness, sebum secretion, and capillary dilation (Assessment (A): Skin Identification and Analysis).Program (formulation of a plan): Generates customized protocols addressing identified skin conditions, with defined short-term (1–2 metabolic cycles) and long-term (ongoing) therapeutic milestones (Program (P): Skin Management Programme Planning).Implementation (management and behavioural intervention): Executes interventions using standardized procedures, incorporating behavioral modification strategies to ensure treatment adherence (Implementation (I): Programme Implementation and Behavioural Interventions).Accompany (ongoing conditioning): Conducts periodic reassessments to dynamically adjust regimens based on skin response and environmental changes (Accompany (A): Continuity and Dynamic Adjustment in Skin Health Management).
Figure 1Apia Methodology: A Comprehensive Framework for Skin Management.
        This closed-loop system ensures both immediate therapeutic effects and sustained skin health maintenance, with all phases iteratively informed by quantitative skin measurements.
      
      
        Assessment (A): Skin Identification and Analysis
        Skin managers utilize the visual-tactile-subjective method, which uses sight, touch, and self-perception aided by professional skin diagnostic instruments and tools to provide customers with professional skin identification and analysis (Table 2). This process involves a thorough evaluation of the skin’s basic type, condition, and requirements and includes factors such as pigmentation, texture, stratum corneum thickness, sebum secretion, radiance, pore condition, temperature, moisture level, skin elasticity, and any subjective symptoms. By integrating the customer’s beauty history and skincare behaviour habits, a comprehensive analysis of the current skin issues and their causes is conducted to accurately formulate a phased skin management plan.Table 2Basic Principles of Skin Identification and AnalysisJudgement TypeObservation ContentDescriptionVisual judgementPigmentationEvenness of skin tone, dullness, discolourationCondition of the stratum corneumThickness and density, redness or dilated capillaries, smooth and fine skin or rough and uneven skinSebum productionSebum production, oil clogging conditionGlossBrightness and tone, hydrated or dull skinTransparencyGlossy and flawless, transparent and delicate texturePoresSize matches skin type, oil clogging, pore depressionsWrinklesDry lines or wrinkles, such as forehead lines, crow’s feet, and frown linesCapillary blood vesselsExpansion of vesselsTactile judgementHydrationMoist, smooth, soft, elastic, slightly cool skin temperature (high water content in the stratum corneum)DrynessDryness, roughness and unevenness, poor softness, poor elasticity, high skin temperature (low water content of the stratum corneum)Self-judgementSelf-awarenessTightness, heat, swelling, itching, tingling, heaviness, etc.ComfortComfortable and senseless on the skin
      
      
        Program (P): Skin Management Programme Planning
        After conducting a professional assessment, the skin manager tailors a comprehensive and personalized skincare regimen for each customer, adjusting the skin through our standardized three-phase protocol (Table 3) where interventions are progressively modified based on achieving phase-specific clinical targets. This plan outlines the skincare routine, lists carefully selected products, establishes the frequency of care, and provides necessary usage guidelines. Phase transitions are determined through integrated evaluation of both instrumental measurements and visible skin improvements. In addition, considering the individual needs of the customer and their willingness to cooperate, the plan also includes behavioural intervention strategies to help customers effectively implement care both at home and in professional settings. The customer is not only a participant in this process but also a learner, gradually acquiring skincare knowledge to achieve long-term maintenance of skin health.Table 3Skin Management Planning MilestonesPeriodTargetProblematic SkinHealthy SkinTime of RealizationDescriptionIImprovement of self-perceptionSelf-conscious symptoms such as heat, itching, and tightnessMoisturization and softness1 to 2 skin metabolic cyclesTargeted enhancement of the skin’s water content and relief of discomfort.

        Skin management planning includes home and hospital care programmes for various skin conditions during different seasons and in different environments. The core principle of skin management planning is the enhancement of self-perception by increasing the water content and creating a stable external environment for self-repair. Additionally, it aims to improve skin appearance in a targeted manner and to conduct a scientific and systematic restoration of skin function to preserve skin health, beauty, and youthfulness. In the skin management planning process, the three phases aim to maintain the functional health of the skin systematically and scientifically. This approach aims to achieve long-term maintenance of a youthful state characterized by lightness, delicacy, firmness, and elasticity.
      
      
        Implementation (I): Programme Implementation and Behavioural Interventions
        During the implementation phase, treatments must be provided according to the skincare programme developed. Moreover, the necessary behavioural interventions must be implemented to help clients develop healthy habits and proper skincare practices. Behavioural intervention is one of the key components of the APIA skin management system. Education and guidance can help clients change unhealthy behavioural patterns and develop healthy lifestyles. In the field of skincare, behavioural intervention can help customers correct improper skincare behaviours and develop good skincare habits. Sensory assessment of cosmetic suitability (see File S1) can help customers choose suitable products and guide them to use the products correctly. Specialized skin identification procedures are conducted by professionals in accordance with the scientific skin management clinic programme to ensure optimal clinical treatment results.
      
      
        Accompany (A): Continuity and Dynamic Adjustment in Skin Health Management
        Ongoing conditioning requires timely adjustments and continuous support in response to changes in a client’s skin condition and needs throughout the skincare programme. This process not only helps customers follow the skincare programme more effectively, thereby enhancing the treatment’s success, but also helps them identify and respond to emerging skin challenges in a timely manner, ensuring long-term skin health maintenance. By dynamically monitoring the customer’s environment, seasonal changes, at-home product experience, in-home care feedback, and changes in physical status (eg, pregnancy, colds), product usage and in-home care practices can be adjusted based on actual skin improvement. In addition, continuous treatment involves correcting improper skin care behaviours, summarizing successful experiences of skin improvement, and guiding customers to establish a scientific concept of beauty, empowering them to become the leaders of their own skin health management. Through this process, customers can not only realize significant improvement in their personal skin condition but also influence and inspire others around them to achieve skin health and beauty through a positive lifestyle and scientific skincare knowledge.
      
      
        Study Design
        A total of 74 healthy Chinese female volunteers, aged 20–51 years (mean age ± SD: 32 ± 7.06 years), participated in this study after providing written informed consent. The study was approved by Scientific Research Ethics Committee of the School of Light Industry Science and Engineering, Beijing Technology and Business University, with approval number BTBUECSR2024031. All the subjects had lived in Shanghai for at least one year. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) menstruating, pregnant or breastfeeding; (b) use of hormonal medications or receipt of anti-immunotherapy within 1 month or during the study period; (c) cosmetic surgery, aesthetic treatments, tattooing, maintenance, spotting of moles, facial plastic surgery, or cosmetic needle injections; (d) severe systemic, immunodeficiency, or autoimmune disease; (e) significant signs of skin irritation, facial injury, swelling, or scarring; (f) cold, headache, or fever on the day of the test; and (g) lack of consent, incomplete information, or participation in other clinical trials. Informed consent was obtained from the participants, and the study complied with appropriate privacy and data protection standards.
        In this study, we utilized a comprehensive design of the Skin Recognition Information Scale, which is used to quantitatively evaluate essential skin characteristics, such as the stratum corneum condition, oil shine, moisture content, elasticity, and skin texture. The assessment of each skin parameter is carried out by a professional skin therapist through visual assessment. We use standardised skin photos and text descriptions to identify skin information and obtain scale data for each skin parameter (see File S1). This scale is a reliable quantitative assessment tool to validate the effectiveness of the APIA methodology in skin management. This study utilized a before-and-after design to assess the skin condition of 74 participants who underwent APIA skin management at the salon. To ensure consistency and accuracy in the assessments, all participating skin managers received specialized training. The study also established a standardized skin care collection process to ensure a consistent method of data collection before and after skin management. High-quality images were obtained through catheterization to visualize the effects of skin management. This study assessed the effectiveness of the APIA methodology in improving skin conditions by comparing scale scores and image analysis before and after skin treatment.
      
      
        Statistical Analysis
        All the statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS® software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA; ver. 26) for Windows. The data analysis included the following steps: 1) Analysis of differences in categorical variables—Categorical variables such as self-perceived feelings, skin condition, acne, pigmentation, sensitivity, ageing, and eye area characteristics are described using response rates and prevalence rates. The differences between variables were analysed using chi-square tests with case weighting to assess the differences between groups. 2) Analysis of differences in continuous variables—Continuous variables such as stratum corneum thickness, sebum secretion, degree of pore blockage, skin colour, gloss, pore size, degree of capillary dilation, skin softness, smoothness, skin temperature, moisture, and elasticity are described using descriptive statistical methods (mean ± standard deviation), and Mann‒Whitney U-tests were used to analyse the significant differences between variables. P values <0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

        Comparison of Skin Characteristics Before and After Skin Management - Categorical Variables
        In this study, we compared the response and prevalence rates of categorical variables before and after skin management. We analysed the changes using a chi-square test to evaluate the impact of the APIA methodology on skin health status. Categorical variables included self-perception, skin condition, acne, pigmentation, sensitivity, ageing, and eye skin characteristics. The response rate is defined as the ratio of the number of people reporting each skin problem to the total number of selections in the multiple-choice questions, indicating the relative proportion of a skin problem; the prevalence rate is defined as the ratio of the number of people reporting each skin problem to the total number of people, indicating the prevalence of skin problems (Figure 2 and Table 4).Table 4Pearson’s Chi-Square Test Results for Categorical VariablesSkin CharacteristicsConditionN, %χ²P valueBefore Skin ManagementAfter Skin ManagementSelf-perceptionAsymptomatic(2, 1.22)(74, 100)228.911a0Thickness and heaviness(27, 16.46)(0, 0)Heat(55, 33.54)(0, 0)Itch(29, 17.68)(0, 0)Tightness(25, 15.24)(0, 0)Swelling(15, 9.15)(0, 0)Stinging(11, 6.71)(0, 0)Skin conditionAsymptomatic(0, 0)(55, 71.43)168.732a0Instability(25, 14.04)(0, 0)Dryness(50, 28.09)(3, 3.90)Acne(33, 18.54)(6, 7.79)Pigmentation(26, 14.61)(9, 11.69)Sensitivity(40, 22.47)(3, 3.90)Ageing(4, 2.25)(1, 1.30)AcneAsymptomatic(18, 13.43)(57, 77.03)96.738a0Pimples(48, 35.82)(7, 9.46)Inflammatory papules(39, 29.10)(1, 1.35)Pustules(13, 9.70)(0, 0)Nodules(3, 2.24)(0, 0)Cysts(3, 2.24)(0, 0)Scars(10, 7.46)(9, 12.16)PigmentationAsymptomatic(24, 24.49)(41, 53.95)30.844a0Freckles(26, 26.53)(25, 32.89)PIH(17, 17.35)(7, 9.21)Chloasma(30, 30.61)(2, 2.63)Age spots(1, 1.02)(1, 1.32)SensitivityAsymptomatic(5, 3.16)(73, 97.33)202.667a0Heat(49, 31.01)(1, 1.33)Itch(25, 15.82)(1, 1.33)Tightness(30, 18.99)(0, 0)Swelling(14, 8.86)(0, 0)Stinging(3, 1.90)(0, 0)Erythema(25, 15.82)(0, 0)Papules(1, 0.63)(0, 0)Scales(6, 3.80)(0, 0)Skin ageingAsymptomatic(13, 10.08)(58, 73.42)96.600a0Dry lines(55, 42.64)(3, 3.80)Fine lines(38, 29.46)(6, 7.59)Expression lines(16, 12.40)(6, 7.59)Sagging(7, 5.43)(6, 7.59)Eye skinAsymptomatic(12, 9.30)(56, 69.14)89.430a0Dry lines(55, 42.64)(3, 3.70)Dark circles(19, 14.73)(9, 11.11)Eye bags(2, 1.55)(1, 1.23)Fine lines(36, 27.91)(9, 11.11)Crow’s feet(2, 1.55)(1, 1.23)Sagging(3, 2.33)(2, 2.47)
Figure 2Apia Methodology: A Comprehensive Framework for Skin Management. Comparison of the response rate and prevalence rate before and after skin management.
        Comparative analysis indicated a significant improvement in both the response and prevalence rates of self-perceived skin sensations after skin management. The chi-square test results confirmed that differences in variables such as self-perceived sensations, skin condition, acne, pigmentation, sensitivity, ageing, and skin of the eye area were statistically significant (p < 0.05), highlighting the positive effects of skin management.
        Specifically, self-perceived sensations significantly improved following skin management, with the majority of participants transitioning from experiencing multiple symptoms to being symptom free. Moreover, key indicators such as skin condition, acne, sensitivity, pigmentation, and ageing also showed a significant increase in response and prevalence rates. Prior to skin management, the predominant self-perceived sensation was heat, accounting for 33.54% of the responses; dry skin conditions had a response rate of 28.09%; acne was primarily characterized by blackheads and whiteheads, with a significant proportion of 35.82%; pigmentation issues mainly included melasma, representing 30.61% of the cases; sensitivity was mainly manifested as heat, with a proportion of 31.01%; ageing was predominantly indicated by fine lines, with a 42.64% proportion; and in the eye area, fine lines were the primary concern, accounting for 42.64% of the responses. In terms of prevalence rates, self-perceived sensation of heat was the most prevalent, with a proportion of 74.32%; dry skin conditions had the highest prevalence at 67.57%; acne, characterized mainly by blackheads and whiteheads, had a prevalence of 64.86%; melasma was the most common type of pigmentation, with a proportion of 40.54%; heat-related sensitivity had a prevalence of 66.22%; ageing, indicated by dry lines, had a prevalence rate of 74.32%; and in the eye area, dry lines had the highest prevalence at 74.32%.
        After skin management, adverse sensations were absent, and the proportion of individuals with healthy skin conditions increased to 71.43%. The prevalence of acne-free skin increased to 77.03%, that of pigmentation-free skin increased to 53.95%, that of symptom-free skin sensitivity increased to 97.33%, that of healthy ageing skin increased to 73.42%, and that of healthy eye area skin increased to 69.14%. In terms of prevalence rates, healthy skin was the most common at 74.32%, followed by absence of acne at 77.03%, absence of pigmentation at 55.41%, absence of sensitivity at 98.65%, decreased ageing at 78.38%, and healthy eye area skin at 75.68%.
      
      
        Comparison of Skin Characteristics Before and After Skin Management - Continuous Variables
        In this study, changes in continuous variables before and after skin management were analysed using the Mann‒Whitney U-test to evaluate the impact of the APIA methodology on skin health status. Continuous variables included stratum corneum thickness, sebum production, degree of pore clogging, skin colour, radiance, pore size, degree of capillary dilation, skin softness, smoothness, skin temperature, moistness, and elasticity. These indicators were scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 3, with higher values indicating greater severity of skin problems (Table 5).Table 5Descriptive Statistics and Analysis of Variance Results for Continuous VariablesSkin CharacteristicBefore Skin ManagementAfter Skin ManagementP valueMean ± SDVarianceMedianMean ± SDVarianceMedianStratum corneum thickness2.58±0.780.603.001.05±0.280.081.00<0.001Sebum secretion2.50±0.800.643.001.07±0.250.061.00<0.001Pore blockage2.43±0.680.473.001.23±0.430.181.00<0.001Skin colour3.00±0.000.003.001.05±0.330.111.00<0.001Gloss2.38±0.490.242.001.07±0.250.061.00<0.001Pores1.95±0.330.112.001.88±0.330.112.000.222Capillary dilation2.16±0.680.472.001.19±0.390.161.00<0.001Softness2.27±0.480.232.001.05±0.230.051.00<0.001Smoothness2.26±0.470.222.001.05±0.230.051.00<0.001Skin temperature2.69±0.770.593.001.00±0.000.001.00<0.001Moisture2.36±0.480.232.001.04±0.20.041.00<0.001Elasticity2.01±0.200.042.001.03±0.160.031.00<0.001
        Comparative analysis revealed that after skin treatment, both the mean and median values of the aforementioned indicators significantly decreased, indicating a marked improvement in skin condition. Specifically, the improvements in stratum corneum thickness, sebum secretion, degree of pore blockage, skin colour, gloss, extent of capillary dilation, skin softness, smoothness, skin temperature and moisture levels were all statistically significant (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that the APIA methodology is significantly effective in these areas. However, the improvement in pore size did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05).
      
      
        Comparative Analysis of Skin Conditions with a High-Definition Imaging Device Before and After Skin Management
        In this study, the skin conditions of participants before and after APIA skin management were visually compared and analysed using a DJM Cat Skin Detector II from Germany. By comparing the high-definition skin images before and after management, we observed improvements in redness, sensitivity, and oil production. These comparative images visually demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the APIA methodology in enhancing skin health and client satisfaction, providing strong visual support for skin management practices (Figure 3).
Figure 3Comparison of different imaging modalities before and after skin management.
        This study utilized the various imaging modalities of the DJM Cat Skin Detector II to visualize significant improvements before and after skin treatment. The heliogram revealed improvements in the surface condition of the facial skin. Post-management images showed a reduction in blackheads and surface blemishes, a smoother skin surface, and an improvement in cleanliness and overall appearance. The polarization map demonstrated improvements in uneven skin tone and microvascular structures by attenuating directly reflected light, indicating an enhancement in the overall health of the skin. The texture map emphasized improvements of a more refined skin texture, tighter pores, and fewer fine lines, indicating an improvement in skin firmness and elasticity. The sensitivity map displayed the pinkish-white colour of healthy skin, along with a reduction in inflammation-induced pitting and redness. The processed image showed a more even skin tone and effective sensitivity control. The acne and extent maps assessed improvements in acne status and underlying skin moisture saturation. The images after management showed fewer acne spots and higher skin moisture levels, indicated by a darker blue colour representing elevated moisture content. These results reflect the positive effects of skin moisturization and acne treatment.
        The results of these visual image comparisons not only support the effectiveness of the APIA methodology in improving skin problems but also provide strong visual evidence for skin management practices. By comparing the images before and after the treatment, we can clearly observe positive changes in skin conditions that lead to significant improvements for the client. This finding validates the effectiveness of using the APIA methodology to improve skin health and cosmetic outcomes.
      
    
    
      Discussion
      
        Effectiveness of the APIA Skin Management Method
        The comparative analysis in this study revealed a significant trend towards improvement in skin conditions after skin management. There was a notable increase in the proportion of symptom-free states after management, particularly in self-perceived sensations, which underscores the potential of the APIA methodology to enhance customer experience. The improvement in pore size did not reach a statistically significant level (with a P value of 0.222), which may suggest that pore improvement requires a longer time frame. Given that the image analysis in this study may only reflect the initial effects of the APIA methodology, future research should extend the observation period to allow for a more comprehensive assessment of changes in pore size. In addition, this study covered a wide range of skin types. Although oily dehydrated skin was more prevalent in the sample, which may reflect the more common skin problems of this skin type in daily life, the APIA methodology produced significant improvement in these participants, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing oily dehydrated skin problems. However, given the low percentage of other skin types in the sample, future studies should include a wider range of skin types to comprehensively assess the effectiveness of the APIA methodology on different skin problems. In future studies, we will consider establishing a control group, such as participants using traditional skincare regimens or a placebo, to increase the credibility of the results.
      
      
        Basic Principles of Skin Identification and Analysis
        The diversity of individual skin conditions leads to a wide range of skin problems, and the same skin problems can be caused by numerous factors.5 Skin identification and analysis are the cornerstones of effective skin management. These processes help clients understand their own skin condition, analyse the causes of skin problems, and identify skin improvement goals. This process is essential for maintaining skin health and developing appropriate and personalized skin management strategies. Careful observation of the surface characteristics of the skin and an in-depth understanding of the physiological functions of the skin are needed.
        The condition of the skin is not static; it changes according to factors such as season, age, environment, diet, or physical condition.6–8 For example, skin is oily in young people and dry in old people; skin tends to be oily in summer and dry in winter. Substantial changes also occur due to metabolic changes, different light environments, the amount of mental stress, or suffering from certain diseases and other factors.9–11 Therefore, when a customer’s skin needs improvement or enhancement, the skin manager must make accurate judgements, develop a skin management plan based on the results of skin identification and analysis, and document the effects before and after skin care. The care plan should be tailored to each individual, location, and timeframe.
        The collection of basic customer information is a crucial aspect of skin care reception services, representing the initial step in delivering care and establishing an essential foundation for future skin management. This information helps skincare professionals conduct scientific skin identification and analysis, thereby assisting customers in formulating personalized skincare management plans. For instance, by considering the occupation of customers, such as doctors and nurses who wear masks for extended periods at work, leading to local skin friction affecting the thickness of the stratum corneum and a hot and humid environment causing skin dryness, skincare specialists can advise customers on appropriate protective measures to prevent this dryness. Similarly, in customers with a dry or outdoor work environment, where the skin is susceptible to sensitivity or pigmentation issues, skincare specialists should emphasize hydration, moisturization, and sun protection when providing guidance on skincare. In addition, the customer’s beauty history, including the use of skincare products, salon experiences, and allergy history, is crucial for formulating personalized care plans. Skincare specialists should record these details meticulously to gain a better understanding of the customer’s skin needs and history. Therefore, it is crucial to collect complete basic customer information.
      
      
        Skin Type Identification
        In the past, skin type was primarily classified according to the level of sebaceous gland secretion. However, in recent years, through the application of scientific and objective evaluation methods that investigate various physiological functions of the skin, it has become evident that the water content of the stratum corneum and the amount of sebaceous secretions are distinct and independent elements. The former indicates a healthy stratum corneum formed by normal skin metabolic processes, while the latter is determined by the activity of sebaceous glands. Thus, the combination of sebum secretion and the water content of the stratum corneum results in four basic skin types: normal skin, dry skin, oily skin, and oily dehydrated skin. The typical characteristics of the skin base type serve as the reference to which improvements in the customer’s skin problems are compared. Skin conditions can be categorized into normal skin, skin prone to irritation, and commonly encountered cosmetic skin issues (Figure 4 and Table 6).Table 6Characteristics of Skin Types and ConditionsSkin Type/ConditionVisual JudgementKinaesthetic JudgementConscious JudgementDescriptionNormal skinRosy complexion, moderate sebum secretion, small pores, delicate skinMoist, soft, smooth, elastic and slightly cool skinSkin comfort without any self-consciousnessMost desirable skin type, typically prepubescentDry skinFair complexion, low sebum secretion, small and inconspicuous pores, lack of surface lustre, fine wrinklesSkin not moist, slightly less elastic, slightly cooler skin temperatureSkin comfort without any self-consciousnessSkin is prone to dryness and lack of lustre, moisturization is the focusOily skinDarker skin tone, high sebum secretion, enlarged pores and oily appearance of the skinSkin oily, soft, elastic, slightly cool skin temperatureSkin comfort without any self-consciousnessOily skin with enlarged pores, needs oil control and cleansingOily dehydrated skinDarker and uneven skin tone, high sebum secretion, localized enlarged pores, fine dry lines or dandruff, and oily appearanceSkin rough and uneven, greasy, slightly less soft, slightly less elastic, slightly higher skin temperatureOccasional tightnessSkin with high oil secretion but lacking water, need to balance hydration and oil controlReactive skinDarker and uneven skin tone, localized enlarged pores, scattered red spots, clogging, flaking phenomenonSkin rough and uneven, slightly less soft, slightly less elastic, slightly higher skin temperatureOccasional heat, itching, tightness, localized tingling sensationSkin condition varies and needs to be stabilized and cared forBeauty FAQVisual judgement based on specific issues (dryness, acne, discolouration, sensitivity, ageing)Tactile judgement based on specific issuesConscious judgement based on specific issuesIndividualized treatment plan based on the customer’s specific situationNotes: Darker skin tone “refers to population-based comparison (Fitzpatrick types III–IV norms for East Asians)”, assessed by certified technicians under D65 lighting.
Figure 4Skin type and condition.
        The characteristics of healthy skin include smoothness, refinement, elasticity, and the ability to withstand external stimuli.12 However, when the skin’s condition fluctuates, this usually indicates that the skin is in an unstable state. Skin sensitivity is a transitional state between healthy skin and problematic skin, and it can progress to problematic skin due to a variety of factors. Skin sensitivity can manifest in various ways, such as fluctuations in skin conditions due to physiological cycles, stress, lack of sleep, sun exposure, or changes in climate; frequent, scattered redness on the sides of the nose and cheeks; unsatisfactory results despite maintenance efforts; and persistent skin irritation even after the use of carefully selected skincare products. These symptoms may indicate skin sensitivity. The causes of skin sensitivity can be categorized as external and internal. External causes include improper selection of skincare products, incorrect skincare routines, and unhealthy lifestyle habits, which can result in damage to the skin barrier.13 Internal factors include mental stress, physiological periods, poor physical condition, or diseases that may affect the health of the skin.14–16 Under persistent adverse environmental stimuli, the stratum corneum barrier of the skin may be compromised. This, in turn, can affect the normal maturation process of keratinocytes, resulting in the premature arrival of immature keratinocytes (ie, incompletely differentiated keratinocytes). These immature keratinocytes are unable to effectively perform their barrier function, leading to increased sensitivity to external stimuli and reactive skin conditions. In addition, weakened barrier function may also affect the production and maintenance of the skin’s natural moisturizing factors (NMFs), which are essential for maintaining the moisture and integrity of the stratum corneum. If left unmanaged, an unsettled state may further develop into common problematic skin conditions such as dryness, acne, discolouration, sensitivity, or ageing.
      
      
        Skin Management Programme Planning
        In skin physiology, the moisture content of the stratum corneum is critical for maintaining skin barrier function. A moderate level of hydration in the stratum corneum helps to maintain the water balance between the epidermal layers and prevents excessive water diffusion from the deeper layers of the skin to the surface, thereby preventing overall skin dehydration.17,18 Unevenness in the thickness of the stratum corneum may affect the sensitivity of the skin, as well as the capillary vasodilatory response, which may be related to an imbalance in the skin’s defence mechanisms.19 Furthermore, the absence of moisture in the granular layer may weaken the ability of skin to refract UV rays and diminish its inhibitory effect on melanin production, thereby promoting the development of hyperpigmentation.20 In the stratum spinosum and basal layers, a lack of moisture can lead to acne, inflammatory reactions, slowed cellular metabolism, and a darkened skin tone.21 Moisture loss in the dermis is closely related to ageing phenomena such as wrinkles, sagging skin, and enlarged pores.22 Increased oil production may accompany these skin problems, further exacerbating acne.23 In summary, skin moisture deficiency is a common factor underlying a variety of dermatopathologic conditions and is crucial for maintaining skin health.
        In response to these issues, the first priority in skin management planning is to increase the skin’s moisture content. By making moisturization the core goal of the first phase, the aim is to maintain the skin’s hydrated state and establish a foundation for subsequent skin improvement. Skin moisturization is a fundamental requirement for maintaining healthy skin. This ensures that each layer, from the basal layer outwards through the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum to the stratum corneum, contains adequate moisture. This moisturization promotes UV refraction and accelerates cell division and proliferation in the stratum spinosum and the basal layer, thereby boosting skin cell metabolism and activating dermal fibroblasts. Consequently, this process effectively addresses various skin appearance issues, such as dryness, pigmentation, and skin ageing. Finally, to improve skin appearance, it is also necessary to restore the functional health of the skin. Only healthy skin function can truly achieve a delicate, fair, firm, and youthful state.
      
      
        Advantages of the APIA Methodology
        The planning and full life cycle management strategies of the APIA skin management approach are more appealing to consumers than traditional beauty methods. Against the backdrop of an expanding global beauty market, this specialized approach shows great potential for growth. On the one hand, the skin management plan is comprehensive and timely, covering all aspects of skin conditioning. The professional and customized system plan created by the skincare specialist for the customer targets long-term behaviours and accounts for both short-term and long-term skincare effects. The plan is based on improving healthy skin function, and each phase of the skin management plan is closely connected. Customers clearly understand the goals of each phase, and the fundamental improvement observed in the skin increases the professional confidence of practitioners and enhances the reputation of the beauty establishment. This approach not only focuses on the external improvement of the skin but also values the maintenance of the skin’s internal functions, providing a new perspective and direction for the field of skin management. In addition, integrating the APIA skin management approach with modern technology, such as mobile apps or online platforms, can enhance the efficiency of skin management and customer engagement. These digital tools make it easy for customers to record and track the progress of their skincare treatments and provide instant feedback. These tools not only help clients better understand each stage of treatment planning and implementation but also enhance their sense of control over the skin improvement process. In addition, these tools serve as aids for skincare professionals to communicate with customers, providing personalized care recommendations and reminders, thus enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
      
    
    
      Conclusions
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the APIA skin management approach in improving skin health and client satisfaction. Through a comprehensive assessment and meticulous analysis of the skin conditions of 74 participants, we found that the APIA methodology achieved significant results in enhancing skin hydration, improving self-perceived sensations, and reducing skin issues such as acne, pigmentation, sensitivity, and signs of ageing. These results not only confirm the effectiveness of the APIA methodology for short- and long-term skin improvement but also underscore the importance of personalized and whole-life management in skin health. The scales and professional skin testers used in the study provide scientific assessments for skin management, enabling skin managers to develop and adjust treatment programmes based on the client’s skin condition. This study also investigated the potential of integrating APIA methodology with modern technology to enhance client engagement and simplify care documentation.
      While this study demonstrates APIA’s efficacy under controlled conditions, further research is needed to evaluate its clinical feasibility in real-world settings, including cost-effectiveness analyses, practitioner training requirements, and adaptability across diverse socioeconomic contexts. The methodology’s practicality may be influenced by access to specialized diagnostic tools (eg, DJM Cat Skin Detector II) and client adherence to long-term behavioral interventions.
      It is important to note that the current study faced limitations in terms of research design and assessment methods. Due to the nature of the APIA method, which requires dynamic adjustments of care plans based on complete and continuous skin condition assessments, full blinding may impede the timely optimization of the care plans. To address this, we have implemented the following measures to ensure rigor in the current study: using standardized instruments to collect some objective indicators, incorporating patient self-assessment scales for cross-validation, and planning to introduce expert blinded review in future studies.
      Additionally, considering the involvement of multi-center collaboration and time constraints in this study, a team assessment model was adopted. However, we have taken the following steps to ensure quality: all skin managers completed ≥80 hours of standardized training and assessment, regular calibration meetings were held to unify assessment standards, and double independent assessment was implemented for key indicators. Future research will prioritize the use of single-assessor designs.
      To further strengthen the evaluation system, we plan to introduce standardized patient satisfaction questionnaires and self-assessment scales in subsequent studies. These tools will provide a more comprehensive understanding of patients’ subjective perceptions of both the treatment process and outcomes, thereby offering additional validation of the research findings. Moreover, we intend to incorporate more compliance measurement tools in future research to objectively quantify changes in skin parameters.
      In summary, the APIA skin management methodology offers a scientific, comprehensive, and personalized set of protocols for skin care practices. Its positive impact on improving skin health and customer satisfaction has been demonstrated in practical applications. Future studies should focus on: (1) standardizing training protocols for skin managers, (2) developing simplified assessment tools for resource-limited settings, and (3) conducting comparative effectiveness trials against conventional approaches, and (4) improving the blinding design and assessment standardization. With the continuous development of the beauty market, the APIA methodology is expected to become an important tool for enhancing skin health and customer satisfaction.

Title: Effect and Safety of Skincare Regimens Containing a Multi‐Molecular Hyaluronic Acid Complex for Recovery After Ablative Fractional CO2 Laser: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled Trial

Abstract: ABSTRACTBackgroundFractional CO2 laser is commonly used for various skin issues but often causes side effects like erythema, hyperpigmentation, and prolonged recovery, negatively impacting patients' quality of life.ObjectivesThis study evaluates the effect of hyaluronic acid (HA) dressings with different molecular weights (large: medium: low = 2:2:1) on skin barrier repair after CO2 fractional laser treatment, providing clinical evidence for post‐procedural skincare.MethodsIn this prospective, randomized, open‐label, controlled trial, patients aged 19–45 who underwent CO2 fractional laser treatment were randomly assigned to either the hyaluronic acid (HA) group (Group A) or the control group (Group B). The primary endpoint was transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at day 14. Secondary endpoints included erythema index (EI), melanin index (MI), skin hydration, semi‐quantitative acute inflammatory response scores (erythema, burning sensation, edema), erythema duration, edema duration, pain duration, scab shedding time, and overall patient satisfaction on day 14.ResultsA total of 60 patients were included. On day 14, the TEWL in Group A was significantly lower than in Group B (16.69 vs. 19.79, p = 0.009), and the percentage change in TEWL during the period of the most significant reduction was also greater in Group A than in Group B (−75.10% vs. −70.89%, p = 0.042). The EI in Group A were significantly lower than those in Group B on days 3, 7, and 14 (325.41 vs. 370.83, p = 0.038; 297.77 vs. 338.32, p = 0.041; 287.14 vs. 337.38, p = 0.004). The pain duration in Group A was also significantly shorter than in Group B (0.20 vs. 0.53, p = 0.014). In addition, Group A patients reported higher satisfaction scores on the post‐treatment questionnaires.ConclusionsThis study highlights hyaluronic acid with varied molecular sizes enhances post‐laser recovery by reducing TEWL and erythema, alleviating pain, and promoting healing.

Body: 1
      Background
      
        1.1
        Fractional Laser and Adverse Reactions
        Fractional lasers, particularly CO2 lasers with a wavelength of 10 600 nm, exert photothermal effects by targeting water‐rich structures in the skin, including the epidermis, collagen fibers, and blood vessels. This generates thermal effects that promote epidermal regeneration, collagen synthesis, and remodeling, and ultimately lead to wrinkles, tightening skin, shrinking pores, and improving texture. Clinically, it is primarily used for the treatment of conditions such as atrophic scars, photoaging, and wrinkles [1, 2].
        However, CO2 fractional laser treatment may compromise the integrity of the skin barrier. Its photochemical effects impair intercellular adhesion, disrupting the stratum corneum's “brick‐wall” structure. Thermal damage leads to keratin denaturation, affecting the skin's barrier. Photomechanical effects create mechanical stress, damaging keratinocytes and causing erythema, edema, dryness, and desquamation [3]. While most of these effects self‐repair, improper management can cause long‐term issues like persistent erythema and post‐inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), which may take months to resolve, causing physical and psychological distress for patients [4].
      
      
        1.2
        Postoperative Repair After Fractional Laser Treatment
        Proper perioperative management is crucial for laser treatments as it can reduce or prevent the occurrence of adverse reactions and improve treatment outcomes. Postoperative care following fractional laser treatment primarily focuses on promoting healing, maintaining moisture, and sun protection, with a strong emphasis on the restoration of skin barrier function. This helps alleviate postoperative skin reactions, prevent skin infections, accelerate tissue repair, and promote wound healing [5]. Expert recommendations for skincare after non‐surgical and surgical procedures suggest several products to speed up recovery, including mineral water, conjugated linoleic acid, vitamin C/vitamin E/ferulic acid, and so on [6]. Therefore, a range of repair products with anti‐inflammatory and moisturizing effects can be beneficial after CO2 fractional laser treatment.
      
      
        1.3
        Characteristics of Hyaluronic Acid and Its Role in the Skin
        Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a non‐sulfated glycosaminoglycan composed of alternating units of D‐glucuronic acid and N‐acetyl‐D‐glucosamine [7]. It is widely distributed in connective tissues and skin [8]. HA not only contributes to the extracellular matrix along with collagen, elastin, and other components, but also interacts with adhesion proteins like CD44 [9] and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM‐1) [10] to regulate cellular functions, including signal transduction, inflammation, wound healing, and angiogenesis. Therefore, HA exhibits various pharmacological effects, including anti‐inflammatory, wound healing, immune modulation, anti‐cancer, anti‐diabetic, anti‐aging, and skin repair functions [11].
        In the skin, HA plays a crucial role in moisturizing, immunoregulation, and tissue repair [12]. As a natural moisturizing factor, it can absorb up to 1000 times its weight in water. Studies show that HA improves skin hydration by 134% immediately and maintains a 55% increase after 6 weeks of use in patients with facial photoaging [13]. HA has also demonstrated benefits in wound healing, such as reducing skin reactions after radiotherapy [14] and promoting healing in venous ulcers [15].
        However, the biological activity of HA is highly dependent on its molecular weight. High‐molecular‐weight HA (HMW‐HA, with a molecular weight of approximately 2 × 106) forms a protective, moisturizing film on the skin. Low‐molecular‐weight HA (LMW‐HA, with a molecular weight not exceeding 1 × 106) penetrates deeper, offering hydration and regulatory effects. Medium‐molecular‐weight HA (MMW‐HA) lies between HMW‐HA and LMW‐HA in terms of size. Oligomeric HA (HA‐o) is a biological polysaccharide fragment formed by recombinant human HA enzyme cleavage followed by special processing [16, 17]. During the early stages of wound healing, HMW‐HA is degraded into LMW‐HA, which initiates inflammatory responses. In the later stages, newly synthesized HMW‐HA helps suppress inflammation, promote tissue repair, and reduce scar formation [18].
        In our randomized controlled trial, we aim to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of multi‐molecular‐weight hyaluronic acid dressings in promoting recovery following CO2 fractional laser treatment.

        2.1
        Study Subjects
        This prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted at the Department of Medical Cosmetic Center of Shanghai Skin Disease Hospital in China. Patients aged 18–60 years with Fitzpatrick skin types II‐IV who met the eligibility criteria were enrolled and received CO2 fractional laser treatment. Individuals were excluded from the study if they met any of the following conditions: ① currently undergoing or planning to undergo facial medical treatments or aesthetic procedures; ② a history of allergy to hyaluronic acid or a hypersensitivity constitution; ③ history of keloid formation; ④ active facial infections (e.g., herpes simplex virus infections); ⑤ suspicious malignant lesions on the face; ⑥ organic diseases affecting major organs such as the heart, brain, lungs, liver, or kidneys; ⑦ pregnant or breastfeeding women; ⑧ history of psychiatric or mental disorders; ⑨ other conditions that the investigators deemed unsuitable for participation in the study. If participants experienced unexpected adverse reactions, if investigators determined that they could no longer continue with the trial, or if participants voluntarily withdrew for any reason, they were excluded from the study.
        Informed consent was signed and obtained from each participant. This study was conducted in accordance with the research protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Skin Disease Hospital (No. 2023‐1 106 140 (scientific)).
      
      
        2.2
        Grouping and Interventions
        Based on our previous similar clinical studies, the sample size was determined to be 30 subjects per group [19]. Patients were randomly assigned to the hyaluronic acid group (Group A) and the control group (Group B) using an even‐odd method, with 30 patients in each group. General demographic data, including sex and age were compared between the two groups, and no significant differences were found (p > 0.05).
        This study included six visits: screening visit (T0), treatment visit (T1: immediately post‐operation, no product applied), and follow‐up visits (T1–T5: immediately post‐operation, 2 h post‐operation, day 3, day 7, and day 14) (Figure 1). The screening visit (T0), treatment visit (T1: immediately post‐operation), and the first follow‐up visit (T2: 2 h post‐operation) took place on the same day.

Subjective evaluations were recorded by the patients.
          
          
        
        At T0, all patients received CO2 laser treatment using the CO2RE system. The treatment parameters were set as follows: wavelength: 10.6 μm, energy density: 55 J/cm2, spot size: 7.8 × 7.8 mm2, frequency: 40 Hz, and coverage: 5%. The device was directly applied to both sides of the face, and after treatment, ice packs were applied to the scar area for 30 min. After 30 min, a hyaluronic acid mask was applied to Group A for 15 min, followed by a placebo cream, while Group B had the placebo cream applied. Data collection for T1 was done 2 h post‐operation for both groups.
        For home care, Group A applied the placebo cream for 14 days (twice daily), and used the HA dressing for 7 days, with additional applications on days 8, 10, and 12. Group B applied the placebo cream for 14 days (twice daily). The HA dressing used in this study contained a composite formulation with a molecular weight ratio of large: medium: low molecules = 2:2:1. The placebo was a single cream base (without any special ingredients) formulated by the Shanghai Skin Disease Hospital.
      
      
        2.3
        Data Collection and Evaluation
        The primary endpoint of this study was the transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measured on day 14. Other evaluation parameters included objective assessments (erythema index (EI), melanin index (MI), and skin hydration on day 14) as well as subjective assessments of treatment (semi‐quantitative score of acute inflammatory response, duration of erythema, duration of edema, duration of pain, scab shedding time, and overall patient satisfaction).
        Objective data collection was performed using the multifunctional skin tester MPA20 (Courage Khazaka, Germany) along with the MX18 probe (for EI and MI), the Corneometer CM825 probe (for skin hydration), and the Tewameter TM300 probe (for TEWL).
        The semi‐quantitative score of acute inflammatory response (AISQS) was evaluated by clinicians at T1 and T2 based on erythema, burning sensation, and edema at the treatment site. Severity was rated as follows: no erythema, burning, or edema = 0 points; mild erythema, burning, and slight edema = 1 point; moderate erythema and burning with mild edema = 2 points; and marked erythema, burning, and edema = 3 point [20].
        The duration of scab shedding, erythema, edema, and pain was recorded daily by the participants. Participant satisfaction was assessed through a self‐reported questionnaire on postoperative day 14.
      
      
        2.4
        Data Analysis
        For the comparison of baseline data between the two groups for continuous variables, either an independent samples t‐test or the Mann–Whitney U test was used based on the data distribution. To account for the influence of baseline levels, comparisons of skin parameters (excluding baseline data) were adjusted using T0 measurements as covariates. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) or non‐parametric ANCOVA (Quade Nonparametric ANCOVA) was applied for comparison based on the data distribution, with p‐values obtained after Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. For categorical variables, statistical comparisons were made using the Chi‐square test or Fisher's exact test. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (version 29.0), and figures were created using GraphPad Prism (version 10). A significance level of α < 0.05 was considered statistically significant in all analyses.

        Primary Endpoint Comparison—TEWL on Day 14
        On day 14 after CO2 fractional laser treatment, the TEWL in group A was significantly lower than that in group B (16.69 vs. 19.79, p = 0.009) (Figure 2a). Furthermore, during the period of the most significant decrease in TEWL (T1–T3) (Figure 2b), the percentage reduction in TEWL was greater in group A compared to group B (−75.10% vs. −70.89%, p = 0.042) (Figure 2c). These results suggest that HA can accelerate the restoration of hydration during critical periods, thereby contributing to the repair of the skin barrier.

EI, MI, Skin Hydration on Day 14 and All Skin Parameters Changes Relative to Baseline
        In addition to its ability to repair the skin barrier, hyaluronic acid (HA) also significantly improved the erythema index (EI). On postoperative days 3, 7, and 14, the erythema index in the Group A was significantly lower than in the Group B (325.41 vs. 370.83, p = 0.038; 297.77 vs. 338.32, p = 0.041; 287.14 vs. 337.38, p = 0.004) (Figure 3a). However, no significant differences were observed in skin hydration (Figure 3b) or melanin index (MI) (Figure 3c). The p‐values are based on data adjusted for covariates, with statistical details presented in Table 2.

        Figure 4 presents representative images of erythema changes at different time points after treatment. Immediately after fractional laser therapy, prominent erythema was observed in the treated areas, reaching its peak at 2 h postoperatively. Subsequently, erythema gradually subsided over time. By day 3, a slight reduction in erythema was noted, although it remained noticeable; at this point (T3), the HA group already demonstrated a visible improvement compared to the control group. By day 7, most erythema had significantly improved; and by day 14, the skin had nearly returned to normal, with only minimal residual redness. However, in Figure 4b, a male patient in the control group still exhibited residual erythema on day 14. These observations are consistent with the EI (erythema index) measurements and further support the efficacy of hyaluronic acid in promoting postoperative erythema resolution.

        We then assessed skin repair by comparing the changes from baseline to the endpoint (day 14). Consistent with the results observed on day 14, significant statistical differences were observed in the EI and TEWL in group A compared to group B. The change in TEWL was greater in group A than in group B (−0.56 vs. 2.02, p = 0.009), and the change in EI was smaller in group A than in the control group (41.09 vs. 66.42, p = 0.01). There were no significant differences in the changes in skin hydration or melanin index. Table 3 presents the adjusted change values based on covariate correction, along with the corresponding statistical results.

      Discussion
      This study represents the first prospective randomized controlled trial in China to evaluate the postoperative recovery efficacy and safety of composite hyaluronic acid dressings containing multiple molecular weights for CO2 fractional laser treatment. The results show that the composite hyaluronic acid formula has significant efficacy in improving postoperative transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema index, and pain duration.
      Hyaluronic acid (HA), as an important natural moisturizing factor, has been widely used in dermatology, particularly for wound healing, anti‐aging, and skin barrier restoration. Bourguignon et al. confirmed that HA can regulate keratinocyte differentiation and the formation of extracellular lipid layers via interaction with CD44, maintaining epidermal barrier function [21]. The moisturizing effects of HA vary by molecular weight: HMW‐HA forms a protective film on the skin's surface, trapping moisture and preventing water loss, while LMW‐HA penetrates the epidermis for deeper hydration [22]. Compared to other moisturizers (e.g., polyethylene glycol, glycerin, ethylene glycol, and sorbitol), the advantage of HA is that it is not affected by relative humidity and has excellent water retention properties under both high and low humidity conditions [23].
      Our experiment revealed a significant difference in TEWL between the two groups after 14 days. Additionally, the skin hydration levels also differed between the groups, with the HA Group showing an increase compared to the placebo group, although this difference was not statistically significant. While skin hydration and TEWL reflect different aspects of skin physiology, skin hydration indirectly assesses the stratum corneum (SC) structure and barrier function by measuring water content. TEWL, on the other hand, more closely reflects functional skin characteristics related to SC structural integrity, diffusion rates, and inflammatory conditions [24]. A reciprocal relationship between skin hydration and TEWL has been observed in other studies [24, 25].
      The use of a composite molecular weight HA dressing significantly improved facial erythema following CO2 fractional laser treatment, which may be closely related to the regulation of skin healing, angiogenesis, and inflammatory responses by hyaluronic acid at different molecular weights. Erythema is a common post‐procedural reaction after laser treatment. HA plays a crucial role in regulating angiogenesis, acting as an effective modulator of endothelial cell (EC) function. HMW‐HA exhibits anti‐angiogenic effects, inhibiting EC proliferation, migration, and capillary formation [26]. HMW‐HA also enhances Foxp3 expression in Tregs, promoting anti‐inflammatory cytokines such as IL‐2, IL‐10, and TGF‐β. In contrast, LMW‐HA promotes angiogenesis by binding to Toll‐like receptors (TLR2 and TLR4), stimulating the production of TNF‐α and interleukins, displaying pro‐inflammatory characteristics [17, 27, 28, 29]. A clinical trial demonstrated the efficacy of a 0.2% sodium hyaluronate cream in treating rosacea, improving erythema, with better tolerance and compliance [30]. Our results showed significant improvement in the erythema index at all three follow‐up points in the HA group, suggesting HA's role in regulating angiogenesis, inflammation, and antioxidant activity, though further validation is needed.
      In addition to its moisturizing and anti‐inflammatory properties, HA demonstrates notable analgesic effects. HA modulates the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel, reducing nociceptor activity and pain signaling [31]. Gomis et al. demonstrated that HA with a molecular weight above 40 kDa provides analgesia, with 860 and 2300 kDa HA offering sustained and efficient pain relief through HA receptor interactions [32]. Our results also showed that HA significantly reduced pain duration following CO2 fractional laser treatment.
      Overall, the synergistic effects of HA with different molecular weights contribute to moisturizing, anti‐inflammatory, angiogenesis modulation, healing acceleration, and analgesia. HMW‐HA reduces inflammation, stabilizes the extracellular matrix, and inhibits unnecessary angiogenesis, while LMW‐HA improves local blood flow by promoting angiogenesis and accelerating the healing process.
      Although there are many postoperative repair products available, some still have limitations when compared to hyaluronic acid (HA). For example, prolonged use of corticosteroids may lead to acneiform eruptions, and they are only recommended for use within 2 days post‐surgery [33]. Mineral water, while providing some soothing effect, has relatively weak moisturizing capabilities. Certain peptide‐based products, with larger molecular weights, may not be as easily absorbed as HA. Recombinant human epidermal growth factor (rhEGF) has strict storage requirements and may trigger allergic reactions. Therefore, HA has attracted significant attention due to its high hydrophilicity, good biocompatibility, and ease of use. Preliminary pilot studies have shown that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) combined with HA‐based masks can effectively promote wound healing and reduce transient adverse reactions following fractional laser [34].
      There are certain limitations in this study. First, the study's follow‐up duration was limited. Since changes in pigmentation often require a longer period to manifest, Takiwaki et al. also indicate that there is a positive correlation between erythema and melanin index, meaning that the more severe the erythema, the deeper the post‐inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) [35], extending the follow‐up period may help further assess the impact of hyaluronic acid on pigmentation. Second, while the control group received a basic moisturizing cream to represent routine post‐procedural care, it should be noted that wet applications such as facial masks may themselves have therapeutic benefits in post‐laser skin recovery. As such, the lack of a wet dressing control could introduce potential confounding effects. Future studies will aim to refine the control interventions to enhance the rigor and generalizability of our findings. Third, patient self‐assessment of subjective outcomes may have introduced evaluation bias. There may be significant variations in pain perception, skin recovery, and subjective experiences among different patients, potentially affecting the accuracy of the results. Additionally, this study was not designed as a split‐face study. Although we used covariance analysis to adjust for potential confounders, individual differences cannot be entirely ruled out as a source of interference with the results.
      Overall, this study suggests that composite hyaluronic acid with multiple molecular weights has a positive effect on skin recovery following fractional laser treatment, particularly in improving skin barrier function, reducing erythema, and alleviating pain. However, the effects of hyaluronic acid on hydration, pigmentation, and subjective recovery assessment were not significant. Future studies could explore the long‐term effects of hyaluronic acid treatment and assess its potential for use in combination with other dermatological therapies.

      Conclusion
      In conclusion, this prospective randomized controlled trial demonstrates that a skincare regimen with composite hyaluronic acid dressing containing multiple molecular weights improves skin barrier function, reduces erythema, and alleviates postoperative discomfort following CO2 fractional laser treatment, suggesting that its combined use with laser treatment is beneficial for promoting postoperative skin recovery.

Title: The impact of individuals’ self-esteem on cosmetic dermatology preferences assessed using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale: A cross-sectional study

Abstract: The pursuit of aesthetic enhancement through cosmetic dermatology has increased globally, influenced by societal beauty standards and social media. Self-esteem plays a pivotal role in shaping individuals’ choices for cosmetic dermatology procedures. To examine the relationship between self-esteem and preferences for cosmetic dermatologic procedures among the Saudi population, utilizing the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 919 participants in Saudi Arabia. The modified Arabic version of the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale assessed self-esteem levels. Demographic data, skincare habits, and cosmetic procedure preferences were analyzed using χ2 and multivariate regression tests. Low self-esteem was prevalent in 26% of participants and significantly associated with specific skincare habits (e.g., applying routines to hands and neck) and prior cosmetic procedures targeting visible body areas (P < .05). Participants without a history of cosmetic procedures were 1.72 times more likely to exhibit low self-esteem (adjusted odds ratio = 1.718; P = .002), whereas those not planning future procedures showed a decreased likelihood of low self-esteem (adjusted odds ratio = 0.501; P < .001). The study highlights a significant relationship between low self-esteem and increased engagement in cosmetic-seeking behaviors. Understanding these psychological factors can guide practitioners toward more patient-centered care.

Body: 1. Introduction
      The pursuit of aesthetic enhancement, encompassing the use of cosmetics and various surgical and nonsurgical procedures, has witnessed remarkable growth globally. This trend is largely driven by the pervasive influence of social media, which continues to redefine societal beauty standards. With over half of the global population actively engaging with social media platforms, and this number steadily increasing,[1] image-centric platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok have amplified the pressure to present an idealized appearance.[1,2]
      This growing emphasis on physical appearance has profound psychosocial implications, particularly concerning self-esteem. The American Psychological Association defines self-esteem as the degree to which an individual views their qualities and characteristics positively.[3] Studies have consistently highlighted the significant impact of physical appearance on self-esteem. Physical appearance, as a central component of self-image, significantly influences how individuals perceive their worth and confidence. This relationship often manifests in the desire to modify or enhance features to meet societal expectations or personal standards of beauty.[4] Cosmetic dermatology, offering an array of procedures from minimally invasive treatments to comprehensive interventions, plays a pivotal role in this dynamic. Choices in aesthetic treatments are not solely motivated by physical enhancement but are deeply intertwined with psychological factors such as self-esteem and self-image. Individuals with lower self-esteem may seek cosmetic procedures to address perceived inadequacies, while those with higher self-esteem might pursue such enhancements to maintain or elevate their appearance.[4] The motivations behind these decisions are complex, reflecting an interplay of internal self-perceptions and external societal pressures.
      In light of these considerations, our study aimed to examine the relationship between self-esteem and individual choices and preferences for cosmetic and aesthetic dermatologic procedures. Using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), we focused on the public population of Saudi Arabia, a nation with over 35 million people, where ≈80% are active social media users.[5] This demographic provides a unique and relevant context for exploring how social influences and self-esteem intersect with cosmetic-seeking behavior. Understanding this relationship not only sheds light on the psychosocial dimensions of cosmetic dermatology but also informs practitioners about the psychological aspects influencing their patients’ choices, enabling more holistic and patient-centered care.
    
    
      
2. Materials and methods
      
        2.1. Study design
        This cross-sectional study employed an online survey distributed via Google Forms, targeting the general Saudi population. The survey was shared across multiple social media platforms, including X, WhatsApp, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and LinkedIn. All adults were eligible to participate, and data collection was conducted from August to October 2024.
      
      
        2.2. Sample size
        Convenience sampling was used, with the sample size calculated to achieve a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error. A total of 919 participants were enrolled, satisfying the required sample size.
      
      
        2.3. Study tool
        The population’s self-esteem was assessed using the RSES.[6] The RSES measures self-esteem using 10 items answered on a 4-point Likert-type scale: from strongly agree to strongly disagree. For this study, we utilized the modified Arabic version of the RSES as developed by Oweis et al.[7] This version has been adapted to ensure cultural relevance and linguistic accuracy while retaining the psychometric integrity of the original scale, with a reported Cronbach α of 0.81 in their study sample.[7] The RSES is one of the most widely used measures of self-esteem. After reverse-scoring the negatively worded items, the scale can also be scored by totaling the individual 4-point items. The RSES demonstrates a Guttman scale coefficient of reproducibility of 0.92, indicating excellent internal consistency. Test–retest reliability over a period of 2 weeks reveals correlations of 0.85 and 0.88, indicating excellent stability. Low self-esteem was defined as a score below 15, following the cutoff used in the original RSES and in the validated Arabic version of the RSES.[6,7]
        In this study, the term “cosmetic procedures” refers to participant-reported interventions aimed at enhancing physical appearance. These included both nonsurgical treatments (e.g., laser therapies, facial treatments like HydraFacial, chemical or cold peels, botulinum toxin, fillers, platelet rich plasma, radiofrequency, and high-intensity focused ultrasound) and cosmetic surgical procedures, as listed in the survey’s multiple-response items on prior and desired cosmetic interventions.
      
      
        2.4. Demographic information
        The demographic section comprised 9 questions addressing age, gender, region of residence, marital status, smoking status, employment status, monthly income, education level, and history of psychiatric diagnoses. Age was categorized as ≤30 and >30 years to simplify group comparisons and reflect general cosmetic usage patterns.
      
      
        2.5. Ethical consideration
        The study was approved by the institutional review board of the College of Medicine at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Participants provided informed consent through an online questionnaire after being briefed on the study’s objectives and assured of their right to withdraw at any time without obligation. To ensure anonymity, no identifying information was collected, and no incentives or rewards were offered for participation.
        To minimize selection bias, participants were recruited from a diverse range of social media platforms to ensure a broad representation of the Saudi population. Also, to reduce response bias, the survey was designed to be anonymous, preventing social desirability effects.
      
      
        2.6. Statistical data analysis
        Categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages (%). The χ2 test was used to assess the relationship between self-esteem levels, sociodemographic characteristics, and cosmetic dermatology choices. Significant findings were further analyzed using multivariate regression to identify independent predictors of low self-esteem. In addition, the χ2 test was applied to compare cosmetic/aesthetic dermatology choices by gender. A P value threshold of .05 was set to determine statistical significance. All survey questions were mandatory in the Google Forms platform, ensuring complete datasets with no missing responses for analysis. Data analysis was performed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Statistics, version 26 (Armonk).
      
    
    
      
3. Results

      Table 2 shows that respondents with low self-esteem were associated with applying a skincare routine in their hands (P = .023) and neck (P = .037). Regarding the type of skincare products, based on the multiple-response answers, it was observed that moisturizer was the most commonly used skincare product (low: 75.3% vs normal: 75%), followed by cleansers (low: 63.2% vs 65%) and sunscreen (low: 41.4% vs 47.1%). However, these differences in self-esteem did not reach statistical significance (P > .05). Also, no significant relationship was observed between self-esteem and makeup frequency (P = .234). Regarding previous treatment to body areas, it was shown that respondents with low self-esteem were associated with previous treatment on the neck (P = .021), while respondents without a previous history of body area enhancement were less likely to have experienced low self-esteem (P = .022).

      In Figure 1, the prevalence of participants with low self-esteem was 26%, while the rest were normal (74%). The overall mean score of the RSE scale was 15.5 (SD: 1.88). In Figure 2, based on multiple-response answers, the most common cosmetic procedure previously performed among respondents was laser (low: 29.3% vs normal: 35.3%), followed by facial, for example, hydra facial (low: 18% vs normal: 19.1%), and dermal filler (low: 14.6% vs normal: 19.1%). However, respondents who did not have a history of cosmetic procedures were less likely to be diagnosed with lower self-esteem (P = .030). In Figure 3), the most common cosmetic procedure that participants wished to undergo was facial, for example, hydra facial (low: 31.4% vs normal: 24.6%; P = .039), followed by laser (low: 28% vs 21.3%; P = .034) and chemical/cold peel (low: 18.8% vs 17.6%; P = .682).

      Table 3 shows inverse significant correlations between total self-esteem score in terms of the number of treated/enhanced body areas (r = −0.094, P = .004) and the number of cosmetic procedures wished to be taken (r = −0.082, P = .013). No significant correlations were observed between the total self-esteem score in relation to the total number of areas applied daily skincare, the total number of skincare products, and the number of cosmetic procedures being undertaken (P > .05). Measuring the relationship between self-esteem among the sociodemographic characteristics and the cosmetic dermatology choices of participants found that younger age group (P = .007), decreasing monthly income (P = .021), no previous history of cosmetic procedure (P = .018) and planned to undergo cosmetic procedure (P = .022) were associated with low self-esteem. No significant relationships were observed between the level of self-esteem in terms of gender, marital status, education, employment status, makeup frequency, total number of areas applied daily skincare, and total number of skincare products (all P > .05) (Table 4).

      On the basis of the significant results obtained from the cross-tabulation method, a multivariate regression analysis was subsequently performed to determine the significant independent predictors of low self-esteem. According to the results, compared with participants who had a previous history of cosmetic procedures, participants without a previous history of cosmetic procedures had an increased chance of having low self-esteem by at least 1.72 times higher (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.718, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.213–2.433, P = .002). In contrast, compared with participants who wished to undergo cosmetic procedures, participants who had no plans for cosmetic procedures had a decreased chance of low self-esteem by at least 50% (AOR = 0.501, 95% CI = 0.352–0.714, P < .001). No significant effects were observed between low self-esteem in terms of age and monthly income after adjustments to a regression model (P > .05) (Table 5).

4. Discussion
      
        4.1. Background and relevance
        This study aimed to explore the relationship between self-esteem and cosmetic-seeking behavior among the public population in Saudi Arabia. The key findings indicate that individuals with low self-esteem are more likely to engage in specific skincare routines and express a desire for certain cosmetic procedures. Notably, low self-esteem was associated with applying skincare routines to the hands and neck, previous treatments on the neck, and a higher inclination toward procedures like facial treatments and laser therapies.
      
      
        4.2. Comparison with literature
        Our study included 919 participants, with 45.2% aged between 18 and 25 years, and a majority being female (68.7%). Approximately half of the participants resided in the Central Region of Saudi Arabia (50.1%). In addition, 12.5% reported having a previous diagnosis of psychiatric conditions. Many studies addressed the relationship between self-esteem and cosmetic-seeking behavior such as botox injections, soft tissue fillers, and laser therapies; with middle-aged individuals as the primary target population.[8–10] However, children and adolescents were found to have lower self-esteem due to dermatological conditions such as acne vulgaris and hair loss.[11,12] The predominance of female gender in the study aligned with prior research that reported a statistically significant difference according to gender. They noted that women have a lower level of emotional well-being than men, as well as greater knowledge and a more positive attitude toward cosmetic dermatology.[9] Another study has found that higher engagement in cosmetic-seeking behaviors was attributed to greater exposure to beauty standards and access to media. Nevertheless, partners and peers had some associations with the utilization of cosmetic products and procedures.[13] The proportion of participants with psychiatric conditions mirrors findings that mental health issues are common among individuals interested in cosmetic enhancements. A study conducted in Mexico on women who underwent body-contouring cosmetic surgery showed that one-third of the population received psychological attention, as well as around half of them having an episode of depression during their lifetime.[8]
        The study found that respondents with low self-esteem were significantly more likely to apply skincare routines to their hands (P = .023) and neck (P = .037) compared to those with normal self-esteem. These findings align with previous research suggesting that individuals may focus more on enhancing specific visible body areas, as antiaging supplements or vitamins and hair removal procedures were most frequently utilized.[13] On the other hand, a study stated that cosmetic surgery has a significant impact on self-esteem, where enhancing body image reduces appearance-related burdens and provides psychological benefits linked to self-esteem. In addition, cosmetic surgery has been shown to improve overall quality of life outcomes.[14] A recent study found an association between upper face dynamic wrinkles and self-esteem. Interestingly, it showed a statistically significant increase in the self-esteem of the participants who were observed 2 weeks after the injection of botulinum toxin. However, the beneficial effects on self-esteem were not presented 3 months following the injection.[15]
        The study found no significant relationship between self-esteem and makeup frequency among participants (P = .234). This goes in contrast with prior research done in 2022 which concluded that higher self-esteem was related to higher makeup frequency.[16] The lack of a significant relationship in our study may be related to the fact that makeup usage is influenced by other factors other than self-esteem alone. Respondents with low self-esteem were significantly more likely to have previously received treatments on the neck (P = .021). The significant link between low self-esteem and previous treatments on the neck supports findings from studies indicating that individuals with lower self-esteem are more likely to pursue cosmetic procedures targeting specific body areas they perceive negatively.[17] In addition, participants without a history of body area enhancement were less likely to experience low self-esteem (P = .022). This finding is consistent with previous research that observed that individuals with greater body appreciation exhibited lower interest in cosmetic surgery, indicating a positive self-perception reduces the desire for aesthetic procedures.[18]
        The study found that the most common cosmetic procedures previously performed among respondents were laser treatments (low self-esteem: 29.3% vs normal self-esteem: 35.3%), followed by facials such as hydra facials (low: 18% vs normal: 19.1%) and dermal fillers (low: 14.6% vs normal: 19.1%). Similar findings were reported by Alharethy[19] in a study done in 2017 to report the demographic trends in Saudi patients undergoing cosmetic procedures. Our findings align with the aforementioned research except for dermal fillers in which reported percentages were 5.8%. This may be implied due to the exponential growth of dermal fillers over the years. Importantly, respondents without a history of cosmetic procedures were less likely to have low self-esteem (P = .030). These findings resonate with prior research indicating a complex relationship between self-esteem and engagement in cosmetic procedures. A study has shown that the majority of the patients who received cosmetic enhancement reported a significant difference and an overall improvement in self-esteem; however, 2 patients did not show a significant difference in self-esteem. The data stated that the 2 patients had had previous cosmetic procedures which may have resulted in improved self-esteem to begin with, or repetitive engagement in cosmetic procedures may contribute to less satisfaction, and consequently less likely to have improvement in self-esteem.[10] A systematic review was done on the psychosocial outcomes following cosmetic surgery. The findings showed that most of the reviewed studies reported that patients are generally happy with the outcome of cosmetic procedures. Still, patients who were dissatisfied with cosmetic procedures had unrealistic expectations of outcomes or underwent more extensive procedures that required greater psychological adjustment.[20]
        The study assessed participants’ self-esteem using the RSES and found that 26% of the participants exhibited low self-esteem, while the remaining 74% had normal self-esteem levels. The overall mean RSE score was 15.5 with a standard deviation of 1.88. The prevalence of low self-esteem among our participants (26%) is consistent with findings from similar populations. For instance, a study done in 2023 on 1099 Saudi university students reported a low self-esteem prevalence of 24.1%.[21] Moreover, a study done in Poland reported that over half of the sample (n = 798) had global low self-esteem.[22] These parallels suggest that low self-esteem is a prevalent concern not only in Saudi Arabia but also globally.
        The study found significant inverse correlations between total self-esteem scores and both the number of treated/enhanced body areas (r = −0.094, P = .004) and the number of cosmetic procedures participants wished to undertake (r = −0.082; P = .013). This means that lower self-esteem is associated with a higher number of body areas treated or enhanced and a greater desire for future cosmetic procedures. These findings align with prior research indicating that individuals with higher self-esteem were significantly associated with lower cosmetic usage.[23] Moreover, a recent study done in Saudi Arabia stated that >70% of the population who sought noninvasive cosmetic procedures reported that the primary motivation to undergo cosmetic procedures was to increase their perceived attractiveness level; consequently, they had high self-esteem.[24]
        The analysis revealed that low self-esteem was significantly associated with being in the younger age group (P = .007), having a decreasing monthly income (P = .021), having no previous history of cosmetic procedures (P = .018), and planning to undergo a cosmetic procedure (P = .022). These findings align with prior research indicating that younger individuals often experience lower self-esteem and heightened body image concerns. The study found that higher age was significantly associated with higher self-esteem.[24] The association between lower income is also supported by existing literature. A study reported that socioeconomic status is associated with engagement in cosmetic procedures, with individuals from families with higher incomes having significantly higher possibilities of having cosmetic procedures.[25] Lower-income backgrounds tend to report lower self-esteem levels. Financial limitations may contribute to feelings of inadequacy or restrict access to means of enhancing appearance, thereby impacting self-esteem. The significant association between planning to undergo a cosmetic procedure and low self-esteem (P = .022) suggests that individuals reporting lower self-esteem more frequently express interest in cosmetic enhancements. This is consistent with prior literature, which found that one of the important factors for pursuing cosmetic procedures.[26]
        The multivariate regression analysis identified significant independent predictors of low self-esteem among participants. Specifically, individuals without a previous history of cosmetic procedures were 1.72 times more likely to have low self-esteem compared to those who had undergone such procedures (AOR = 1.718, 95% CI = 1.213–2.433, P = .002). Conversely, participants who had no plans to undergo cosmetic procedures had a decreased likelihood of having low self-esteem compared to those who wished to undergo them (AOR = 0.501, 95% CI = 0.352–0.714, P < .001). These findings align with previous research exploring the relationship between self-esteem and cosmetic surgery. Studies have indicated that individuals with lower self-esteem are more likely to report interest in cosmetic procedures, possibly as a means to improve their self-image. For example, a systematic review was done to investigate the influence of surgical and minimally invasive facial cosmetic procedures on psychosocial outcomes, and 9 articles measuring self-esteem postprocedure and global improvement were reported.[27] In contrast to prior literature, multiple studies found that low self-esteem is not directly related. For instance, a cross-sectional study assessed the self-esteem and psychological profiles of individuals seeking cosmetic surgery compared with a control group of the general population, the study concluded that individuals seeking cosmetic surgery do not generally exhibit lower self-esteem than the general population.[28] However, associations between body image and other dimensions of self-esteem were significant for both groups, highlighting that the association is multifaceted. Also, the observation that participants without plans for cosmetic procedures had a decreased likelihood of low self-esteem is consistent with studies showing that higher self-esteem is associated with body satisfaction and less interest in altering one’s appearance. Al Ghadeer et al[29] noted a statistically insignificant weak positive correlation between high self-esteem and cosmetic procedures. It was reported that individuals with higher self-esteem are less likely to desire cosmetic procedures.
      
      
        4.3. Strengths and limitations
        A major strength of this study is the sizable sample size of 919 participants, enhancing the representativeness within the digitally active Saudi Arabian population. The use of a validated self-esteem instrument (RSES) adds psychometric reliability to the results. However, the cross-sectional design precludes causal inference, and associations observed should not be interpreted as directional. The reliance on self-reported data may introduce recall and social desirability biases. While anonymity was maintained to reduce such biases, objective validation (e.g., via clinical records) was not feasible given the anonymous, population-based nature of the survey. In addition, the use of convenience sampling through social media may have resulted in demographic overrepresentation – particularly of younger, female, and urban respondents – which may limit generalizability to other subgroups such as older adults, males, or those from rural areas. Lastly, unmeasured psychosocial variables such as cultural pressure, peer influence, and media exposure were not assessed and may serve as important confounders in the relationship between self-esteem and cosmetic behavior.
      
      
        4.4. Recommendations for future research
        Future studies should consider longitudinal designs to assess changes in self-esteem and cosmetic-seeking behavior over time. In the current study, factors such as media exposure, cultural expectations, and peer influence were not directly measured. However, they may serve as important confounders and moderators in the relationship between self-esteem and cosmetic preferences. Future research should aim to include and control for these psychosocial variables to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving interest in cosmetic procedures. In addition, studies should strive for more balanced gender representation and explore targeted interventions aimed at improving self-esteem, particularly among populations at greater risk for appearance-related distress.
      
    
    
      
5. Conclusion
      The intersection of self-esteem and cosmetic dermatology is deeply rooted in societal beauty standards and the pervasive influence of social media, which have significantly shaped individual perceptions of attractiveness and self-worth. Globally, the pursuit of aesthetic enhancement has become increasingly common, with cosmetic dermatology offering various procedures to address perceived imperfections. This study highlights a significant association between low self-esteem and cosmetic-seeking behavior among the public population in Saudi Arabia. Individuals with lower self-esteem more frequently reported engaging in specific skincare routines and expressed interest in cosmetic procedures, particularly targeting visible body areas. These insights underscore the need for integrated approaches in healthcare that address both psychological well-being and aesthetic concerns. By acknowledging the underlying self-esteem issues, practitioners can offer more holistic care, and policymakers can develop targeted initiatives to promote mental health and healthy self-perception.

Title: Bridging clinic to home: domestic devices in dermatological diagnostics and treatments

Abstract: The integration of diagnostic and therapeutic tools into home-used devices has significantly transformed dermatology, making advanced skincare technologies more accessible to the public. Home-based diagnostic devices empower individuals to monitor, assess, and track skin conditions in real time, promoting earlier interventions and personalized skincare. Therapeutic devices, on the other hand, enable users to actively treat cosmetic and dermatological concerns, offering greater autonomy in managing skin health outside the clinical setting. These technologies, often inspired by clinical-grade equipment, promise enhanced patient engagement but also raise critical questions regarding safety, efficacy, and regulatory oversight. Importantly, the regulatory status of these devices, particularly for diagnostic tools, varies significantly across regions, affecting standards for quality, permitted energy outputs, and intended uses. This commentary separately explores the opportunities and challenges posed by home-used diagnostic and therapeutic devices, evaluates their roles in cosmetic dermatology, and highlights key insights from the literature to contextualize their growing influence on personalized skincare.

Body: Introduction
      Technological innovation has long driven advancements in dermatology, with clinical-grade diagnostic and therapeutic tools playing a pivotal role in addressing skin concerns (1). Diagnostic tools, such as confocal microscopy and spectroscopy, are primarily designed to enable precise assessment, monitoring, and early detection of skin conditions. They provide detailed imaging and biochemical analysis that inform clinical decision-making and personalized care pathways. Therapeutic devices, including lasers, intense pulsed light (IPL), radiofrequency (RF) systems, and light-emitting diode (LED) technologies, are aimed at actively treating conditions, improving cosmetic outcomes, and promoting skin rejuvenation (2).
      However, due to the high costs, technical complexity, and need for professional oversight, these tools have traditionally been confined to clinical environments. In recent years, the emergence of home-used devices that replicate these functions has introduced a new dimension to dermatological care (3). Consumers are now empowered to monitor their skin health and undertake certain treatments independently. Yet, this democratization of technology also raises concerns about efficacy, safety, and regulatory oversight. However, the shift from professional to personal use raises important questions about efficacy, safety, and regulatory oversight (3). The regulatory classification of diagnostic devices differs substantially between regions. For instance, the U.S. FDA and European regulatory bodies apply distinct standards for device approval, with further variability seen in Asian markets where energy thresholds and indications may be more permissive. These discrepancies necessitate careful consideration to ensure consistent quality and safety for users worldwide. This commentary explores the distinct roles and challenges of home-used diagnostic and therapeutic devices, emphasizing their implications for patient care, regulatory evolution, and the future of personalized dermatology.
    
    
      Diagnostic tools: From clinics to homes
      Clinical diagnostic tools have long set the standard for precision in dermatology. Technologies such as confocal microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and line-field confocal optical coherence tomography (LC-OCT) provide detailed imaging and biochemical analysis of the skin, enabling dermatologists to accurately diagnose conditions such as acne, pigmentation disorders, and aging (4–8). As Yun and Kwok have emphasized, these technologies rely on sophisticated light-based interactions with the skin, offering rich yet safe synergy with organic molecules (9). Despite their effectiveness, these tools remain largely inaccessible to the average consumer due to their high costs and the need for trained operators. The transition of diagnostic tools into home-used formats marks a significant shift in accessibility, with two distinct strategies emerging. The first approach prioritizes a highly detailed, comprehensive diagnosis performed by a dermatologist, followed by a more holistic, long-term monitoring strategy that considers context, movement, and lifestyle factors. The second strategy aims to achieve high diagnostic accuracy directly at home, reducing reliance on clinical visits. Smartphone-based multispectral imaging, as discussed by Kim et al., is a notable example of this trend. These systems enable users to analyze their skin's hydration, pigmentation, and elasticity in real time, leveraging mobile technology to bring diagnostic capabilities directly to consumers (10). While promising, such devices often fall short of clinical-grade systems in terms of resolution and diagnostic accuracy. Concerns regarding the transparency and validation of AI-driven diagnostic tools have emerged (11). Nevertheless, AI-powered skincare platforms, such as those evaluated by Reich et al., utilize advanced algorithms and sensor technologies to assess skin health and provide personalized recommendations (12). These platforms have the potential to transform skincare routines but rely heavily on user input and environmental factors, which can introduce variability in their performance. Muralidharan et al. have raised critical concerns about the transparency of AI-driven diagnostic tools, particularly regarding algorithm validation, data quality, and the reporting standards of FDA-approved devices and EADV task force guidelines (13, 14). For instance, a comprehensive review by Mineroff et al. examined the clinical applications of photobiomodulation, demonstrating that while some devices show promise, their efficacy depends on precise parameters such as wavelength, fluence, and duration (15).
      Addressing these gaps is essential to fully realize the potential of home-used diagnostic tools.
    
    
      Treatment tools: bridging the clinical-home divide
      Clinical therapeutic devices such as lasers, IPL systems, RF, and LED technologies have long been the cornerstone of dermatology for treating a wide range of conditions, including wrinkles, pigmentation and scars. These devices deliver targeted, high-energy treatments that require professional expertise to optimize outcomes and minimize risks (16). As Goldman has noted, such tools not only address aesthetic concerns, but also provide therapeutic benefits in order to offer comprehensive solutions for skin health (17). The emergence of home-used therapeutic devices has significantly expanded access to advanced skincare treatments. Devices such as LED masks, IPL tools and handheld lasers provide consumers with convenient, cost-effective options for addressing skin concerns (18). For instance, Ng et al. conducted a split-face pilot study on the efficacy of a home-use LED device at 637 and 854 nm for facial rejuvenation and demonstrated significant improvements in skin texture, fine lines, and overall skin tone on the treated side. Their study highlighted the potential of combined red and near-infrared light wavelengths to stimulate collagen production and enhance skin rejuvenation in a non-invasive, user-friendly manner (19).
      Furthermore, Juhász et al. have extensively reviewed home-used IPL devices, demonstrating their effectiveness for hair removal and pigmentation correction (20). However, their findings also underscore the importance of consistent use, as these devices often require longer treatment durations to achieve results comparable to professional systems. Hession et al. have highlighted the growing popularity of handheld laser devices, which offer portability and ease of use (21). More specific studies, such as that conducted by Gold et al., evaluate self-applied blue light therapy for acne as significantly effective in acne lesion reduction (22). However, they emphasized the importance of adherence to treatment protocols, noting that improper use or a lack of professional oversight could limit the effectiveness of these devices. While these devices provide a viable option for addressing localized skin issues, their reduced power levels often result in slower progress compared to clinical treatments (23). These findings illustrate the trade-offs involved in designing home-use devices that prioritize safety for unsupervised use.
    
    
      Opportunities and challenges in diagnostic and treatment devices
      The proliferation of home-used diagnostic and therapeutic devices represents a paradigm shift in dermatology, offering unprecedented accessibility and convenience (24, 25). By enabling consumers to monitor and treat their skin at home, these devices have democratized skincare, fostering greater engagement and awareness (26–29). The integration of AI and internet of things (IoT) technologies further enhances their potential, allowing for personalized treatment plans and real-time monitoring (30). As Bu et al. have noted, AI-driven systems can adapt treatment parameters to individual skin profiles, while IoT connectivity allows devices to sync with apps for progress tracking and remote consultations (18). These advancements hold the promise of transforming domestic devices into powerful tools for personalized, data-driven skincare. However, efficacy and safety concerns are among the most pressing issues remaining a challenge. As Hattersley et al. have documented, user-reported complications such as burns and blisters highlight the risks associated with improper use of these device (31). Reduced power levels, while ensuring safety, often compromise efficacy, requiring longer treatment durations and greater user compliance. User adherence, as Gold et al. have noted, remains a critical barrier to achieving optimal outcomes, underscoring the importance of consumer education and structured support systems (22). Given their increasing use, home-based devices raise substantial regulatory challenges that must be addressed to ensure safety, efficacy, and equitable access across regions. In the United States, devices intended for home use must often meet strict FDA requirements regarding safety and intended use, while in Europe, CE marking is required but categorization may differ based on the device's risk level under the Medical Device Regulation (MDR). Furthermore, permitted power levels, intended indications, and required instructions for use may differ across regions. In some countries, particularly in parts of Asia, regulatory standards for energy-based devices can be more permissive, especially concerning allowable energy outputs and claims for cosmetic indications (13, 14, 32). This disparity highlights the need for international collaboration and global harmonization efforts to establish consistent safety and efficacy standards. Without such frameworks, variability in product quality, performance, and user outcomes can undermine consumer trust and limit the full integration of home-used devices into dermatological care. Addressing these regulatory and practical challenges will be crucial for ensuring the safe, effective, and equitable use of these rapidly expanding technologies.
    
    
      Global access and affordability
      The integration of at-home devices into formal healthcare systems represents an untapped opportunity to enhance dermatologist-patient collaboration (33). Additionally, they have the potential to address disparities in dermatological care, particularly in underserved or remote areas where access to clinics may be limited. In regions with limited healthcare infrastructure, these tools can empower individuals to monitor and manage their skin health without the need for frequent clinical visits (34–36). Smart diagnostic apps, for example, allow users to track skin conditions and seek early interventions, potentially reducing the burden on healthcare systems. However, affordability remains a key concern. While marked as cost-effective alternatives to clinical treatments, many home-use devices require a significant upfront investment, which can be prohibitive for consumers, especially in low-income regions. Additionally, some devices rely on consumables, such as replacement cartridges for IPL systems, increasing their long-term cost. As a result, whether these tools truly democratize dermatological care or primarily cater to wealthier markets remains a subject of debate (37, 38). However, certain compact, accurate, and relatively affordable tools integrated into smartphone ecosystems could help bridge this accessibility gap. For instance, the GPSkin, a validated device for measuring hydration and transepidermal water loss (TEWL), is available for approximately $250 and can synchronize with a smartphone. Such innovations demonstrate how connected dermatological monitoring can provide reliable data at a relatively accessible price point, potentially expanding the reach of at-home skin health management (39). To further narrow this accessibility gap, telepresence-guided consultations could serve as a key innovation. By enabling dermatologists to remotely guide patients through the use of diagnostic and therapeutic devices, telemedicine combined with smart home devices could significantly enhance the accuracy and safety of at-home treatments. This approach would be particularly beneficial and relevant for patients using advanced skincare technologies like home-use lasers, light-based devices, and RF tools, where proper application and real-time adjustments are crucial for both efficacy and safety.
    
    
      Integration into healthcare systems
      The main aspect concerning the integration of home-used devices into formal healthcare systems lies within dermatologist-patient collaboration. By allowing patients to monitor their skin health at home, these devices can provide valuable data for dermatologists to review during consultations (40). For example, smartphone-based diagnostic tools can track the progression of skin conditions over time, offering a comprehensive picture that aids treatment planning (41, 42). In the same way, telemedicine platforms can complement these devices by enabling remote consultations. Dermatologists can use data collected from home-used tools to assess patients’ conditions and adjust treatment plans without requiring in-person visits (43). This hybrid model of care not only improves access, but also enhances patient engagement by fostering a sense of ownership over their skincare routines. To realize this potential, interoperability between home-used devices and clinical systems must be prioritized. Standardized protocols for data sharing and analysis can ensure that the information generated by these devices is compatible with existing healthcare infrastructure (44). Collaboration between manufacturers, healthcare providers, and regulatory bodies will be key to creating an ecosystem where home-used devices complement professional care seamlessly.
    
    
      Impact of consumer behavior and trends
      The increasing demand for personalized and convenient skincare has been a major driver behind the development and adoption of home-used dermatological devices (45). Consumers today are more informed about skincare, largely due to the influence of social media and the proliferation of online communities that discuss and promote various skincare routines and products (46). The abundance of dermatological content has created a market for tools that allow individuals to take control of their skincare. Home-used devices, such as smartphone-based diagnostic tools or LED therapy masks are positioned as accessible and user-friendly solutions for addressing a variety of skin concerns (19). At the same time, social media plays a pivotal role in popularizing these devices. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube feature content creators who demonstrate the use of home-used tools, often providing testimonials that boost consumer confidence (47). However, these trends can sometimes lead to inflated expectations (48). The effectiveness of these devices varies significantly based on the condition being treated, user adherence and the device's design. This dichotomy underscores the need for consumer education and proactive fight against misinformation to balance the enthusiasm driven by marketing with realistic expectations about outcomes.
    
    
      Comparison with professional treatments
      Despite making advanced dermatological care more accessible, home-used devices cannot fully replicate the precision and efficacy of professional treatments. Clinical-grade diagnostic tools, such as confocal microscopy and spectroscopy provide unmatched detail and accuracy, thus enabling dermatologists to diagnose and treat complex conditions. Similarly, professional therapeutic devices like high-power lasers and advanced energy-based devices offer results that are difficult to achieve with at-home alternatives. Home-used devices are most effective for routine maintenance and addressing mild cosmetic concerns (3, 18). For instance, devices such as IPL hair removal systems or LED masks for acne and anti-aging provide measurable benefits for users who are consistent with their treatments (23). However, for severe conditions like deep scarring, complex pigmentation disorders, or medical-grade wrinkle reduction, professional interventions remain the gold standard (49). Emerging research suggests that some innovations in home-use devices may help bridge this gap. For example, advancements in micro-needling technology, particularly when combined with targeted cosmetic formulations (50, 51). Thus, home-used devices would be considered as complementary tools (3). They can extend the longevity of professional treatments by allowing users to maintain results between clinic visits; but they cannot substitute clinical treatments. Subsequently, the balance of professional and personal care reflects an emerging hybrid model in dermatology, where patients can engage with both clinical and home-based tools for comprehensive skin health management. The study performed by Bu et al. underscores the growing role of home-used devices as complementary tools in dermatological care. While these devices are effective for routine maintenance and mild cosmetic concerns, they cannot match the precision and efficacy of clinical-grade tools and professional treatments (18). By bridging professional and at-home care, this study highlights an emerging hybrid model, enabling patients to maintain results and engage in comprehensive skin health management.
    
    
      The role of dermatologists: guiding safe use of home devices
      As at-home dermatology devices continue to gain popularity, dermatologists play a pivotal role in ensuring their safe and effective use. The increasing availability of these tools, ranging from LED masks to at-home IPL and RF devices, empowers consumers to take a more active role in their skincare (3). However, the clinical effectiveness and safety of these devices remain highly variable, necessitating expert guidance. Studies indicate that when dermatologists provide structured education on proper device selection, realistic treatment expectations, and correct usage, patients demonstrate improved adherence and achieve better outcomes (15, 18). Misuse or overuse of these devices can lead to complications such as burns, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and suboptimal results, particularly in individuals with darker skin tones or sensitive skin. As previously discussed, regulatory oversight remains critical to ensure the safe use of at-home technologies (52). Integrating home-use devices into professional dermatologic care presents opportunities to enhance treatment continuity. For example, dermatologists can recommend specific devices for post-procedure maintenance, collagen stimulation, or acne management, ensuring they complement clinical interventions rather than replace them (3). By actively participating in patient education and regulatory discussions, dermatologists can bridge the gap between consumer convenience and clinically validated dermatologic care, optimizing both safety and long-term skin health.
    
    
      Enhancing clinical relevance and addressing safety considerations
      At-home dermatology devices have expanded access to skincare technologies, but their clinical effectiveness, safety, and real-world outcomes remain key considerations (53). While these devices, such as LED masks, IPL, and RF tools, offer convenience, their efficacy is limited by lower energy output, lack of professional calibration, and variable user compliance, often resulting in more gradual and less predictable results compared to in-office treatments. As previously discussed, regulatory oversight remains a key pillar; in this section, we focus specifically on user adherence and safety considerations that influence the clinical effectiveness of home-used devices.
      Many studies evaluating these technologies are constrained by small sample sizes, short follow-ups, and limited statistical significance, necessitating a critical approach to interpreting their clinical relevance. Safety concerns are particularly pronounced in darker skin tones, where at-home IPL devices may increase the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, and at-home microneedling carries risks of infection, scarring, and excessive trauma if misused. Unlike professional treatments, home-use devices often lack regulatory oversight, making product quality and safety inconsistent (54). Despite these limitations, they may serve as valuable adjuncts to clinical treatments, supporting post-procedure recovery, maintaining collagen stimulation, and prolonging the benefits of in-office care. Dermatologists play a crucial role in guiding patients toward evidence-based use, ensuring appropriate device selection, proper application, and realistic expectations to minimize risks while optimizing results (55, 56). As the industry evolves, integrating AI-driven personalization and improved regulatory standards will be essential in bridging the gap between consumer convenience and clinically validated dermatologic care.
    
    
      Ethical and privacy concerns
      The integration of AI and IoT technologies into home-used devices has brought significant advancements in personalization and functionality, but it has also raised ethical and privacy concerns (57, 58). Many of these devices collect sensitive data, including images of users’ skin and detailed health metrics, which are processed and stored to provide personalized recommendations. This raises questions about data security, ownership and the potential misuse of such information. Transparency in how companies collect, store and use data is crucial to building consumer trust (59). Users should be informed about how their information is protected, and whether it will be shared with third parties. Additionally, companies must adhere to robust data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, to ensure compliance with privacy standards. Another ethical concern lies in the potential biases embedded within AI algorithms (60). If the training data for these systems does not adequately represent diverse skin types, the resulting recommendations may be less effective or even inaccurate for certain populations (61). Ensuring diversity in algorithm training and testing is essential to make these devices inclusive and equitable.
    
    
      Long-term studies and evidence gaps
      Despite the growing popularity of home-used devices, there is a lack of long-term studies evaluating their safety and efficacy. Most existing research focuses on short-term outcomes, leaving unanswered questions about the cumulative effects of prolonged use. For example, repeated use of certain light-based therapies may have unknown implications for skin health over time. Additionally, user compliance plays a crucial role in determining long-term efficacy. Many treatments, such as those for acne or pigmentation, require consistent use, and adherence varies significantly among users. For instance, when treating hyperpigmentation, initial improvements achieved with home-used light-based devices could be compromised if users do not maintain strict photoprotection. Research has shown that standardized daily sunscreen applications can significantly slow the progression of pigmentation and wrinkle formation. A recent prospective randomized trial demonstrated that, compared to a classical skincare routine without strict photoprotection, daily sunscreen use over one year led to visible improvements in pigmentation irregularities and fine lines across skin phototypes II to VI (62). Thus, integrating photoprotective measures as part of a structured home treatment regimen may enhance and prolong clinical benefits. Future randomized controlled trials are needed not only to assess clinical outcomes and potential adverse effects but also to evaluate adherence, user satisfaction, and strategies to improve compliance. Comparative studies between home-used devices and professional treatments would further clarify their relative strengths and limitations. Addressing these evidence gaps is essential to guide both consumers and healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and to establish regulatory frameworks that prioritize both safety and efficacy.
    
    
      Future directions: From continuous monitoring to molecular diagnostics
      The evolution of home-used dermatological devices is moving beyond periodic self-assessment toward continuous, real-time skin monitoring through wearable technologies. Miniaturized diagnostic tools embedded in rings, watches, patches, or even fabrics could offer constant evaluation of key skin parameters such as hydration, elasticity, temperature, and even early inflammatory changes. By integrating sensors directly into devices worn daily, users and dermatologists could obtain dynamic skin health profiles, allowing for earlier intervention and personalized preventive strategies.
      Moreover, the next frontier lies in coupling these technologies with molecular diagnostics, particularly in the field of epigenetics. Non-invasive or minimally invasive sampling of skin biomarkers could reveal underlying epigenetic modifications associated with aging, environmental exposures, or disease states. Such information would offer a deeper, more predictive understanding of skin health, transcending visual inspection to reach the molecular and functional level. By integrating wearable monitoring and epigenetic insights, dermatological care could become not only more personalized but also more preventive, anticipating changes before clinical symptoms appear. This approach would further reinforce the dermatologist's role at the center of an intelligent, continuously connected skincare ecosystem.
    
    
      Personal perspectives and future directions
      Based on the current landscape, a hybrid model appears to be the most promising approach for the future of dermatological care. In this model, home-used diagnostic and therapeutic devices would not function independently, but would be fully integrated into a connected ecosystem centered around the expertise of dermatologists. Patients would use wearable and home-based technologies to continuously monitor key skin parameters, while dermatologists would curate, interpret, and personalize the collected data to dynamically adapt preventive and therapeutic strategies. The success of this model will depend heavily on achieving interoperability between home devices, mobile applications, and clinical systems, creating a seamless and efficient continuum of care.
      In the next five to ten years, we anticipate a progressive convergence between wearable diagnostics, AI-driven skin analysis, and targeted home therapies, enabling real-time, dynamic skin health management. Continuous data collection through miniaturized technologies, such as rings, watches, or adhesive patches, combined with molecular insights from non-invasive epigenetic monitoring, will likely open new dimensions in personalized dermatology. Dermatologists will increasingly shift from episodic treatment providers to ongoing skin health coaches, guiding patients through highly individualized care trajectories supported by connected technologies.
      Given the growing complexity and influence of these tools, regulatory frameworks will need to evolve accordingly. Leadership should not rest solely on governmental agencies but rather involve dermatological societies, independent academic researchers, international regulatory bodies, and the industry. Creating globally recognized standards for clinical validation, ensuring algorithm transparency and bias mitigation, and enforcing safety standards that account for diverse skin types will be essential. Dermatologists must be positioned at the center of this regulatory evolution to ensure that technological innovations remain clinically meaningful, ethically grounded, and patient centered. Only through such an integrated approach can the full potential of home-used dermatological technologies be safely and effectively realized.
    
    
      Conclusion: toward balanced integration
      Home-used diagnostic and therapeutic devices are reshaping the landscape of dermatology, making advanced skincare technologies more accessible than ever before. While these innovations hold significant promise, their limitations in efficacy, safety, and regulation underscore the importance of viewing them as complementary to professional care. Dermatologists play a crucial role in guiding consumers toward safe and effective use of these devices, through bridging the gap between clinical and personal care. Beyond individual devices, what is truly emerging is a connected ecosystem where diagnostic tools, therapeutic devices, AI algorithms, and telemedicine platforms interact seamlessly. In this model, the dermatologist remains at the core, acting as an expert coach who interprets data, tailors treatment pathways, and ensures the highest standards of safety and efficacy. The future of home-used devices lies in their ability to integrate into this broader professional ecosystem, allowing for hyper-personalized, real-time skincare management. By fostering collaboration among manufacturers, regulators, and healthcare professionals, the field of dermatology can fully embrace the potential of these tools while maintaining high standards of clinical relevance and patient-centered care.

Title: Treatment of Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea With Collateral Puncture Therapy: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract: BackgroundErythematotelangiectatic rosacea (ETR) is the most common subtype of rosacea, characterized by persistent facial erythema and telangiectasia of varying calibers. It causes significant aesthetic impairment and is often accompanied by uncomfortable symptoms, such as burning, stinging, dryness, and itching, profoundly affecting patients’ quality of life. Intense pulsed light (IPL) therapy demonstrates notable improvement in persistent erythema and telangiectasia; however, it is associated with issues such as a prolonged treatment course and high costs. Collateral puncture therapy involves rapid puncturing of specific acupuncture points followed by gentle squeezing around the needle holes to induce minor bleeding. Previous studies have shown that collateral puncture therapy for ETR offers advantages such as rapid onset of effect, a simple procedure, and low cost. Nevertheless, more high-quality clinical research data are needed to confirm these findings.ObjectiveThis study aims to observe the clinical efficacy and safety of collateral puncture therapy in treating ETR.MethodsThis study enrolled 60 patients diagnosed with ETR. The patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: one group underwent 4 sessions of collateral puncture therapy with 1-week intervals between treatments, and the other group received a single session of IPL therapy. The primary efficacy end points were the clinician’s erythema assessment and the clinician’s telangiectasia assessment. The secondary efficacy end points included the investigator’s global assessment, patient’s self-assessment, Flushing Assessment Tool results, Dermatology Life Quality Index, and Rosacea-specific Quality-of-Life instrument. The evaluation points were before treatment, immediately after treatment, and during follow-up. The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS (version 25.0; IBM Corp) to compare intragroup and intergroup differences between the 2 sets of data before and after treatment, with a significance level of α=.05 for hypothesis testing.ResultsRecruitment began on June 1, 2023. All participants have been recruited. Data analysis will be complete by the end of August 2025, with study findings available by December 2025.ConclusionsThis study has the potential to verify the clinical efficacy and safety of collateral puncture therapy in the treatment of ETR, supplement rosacea treatment methods, standardize treatment protocols, and fill a current clinical gap in treating rosacea.Trial RegistrationChinese Clinical Trial Registry ChiCTR2200062639; https://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.html?proj=177100International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)DERR1-10.2196/59682

Body: Introduction
      
        Background
        Rosacea initially presents with facial flushing, papules, and pustules, which, if recurrent, develop into persistent erythema and varying sizes of telangiectasia [1-3]. A 2019 survey of 10,095 residents in Changsha, China, showed a local prevalence of rosacea of 3.48% [4]. A 2020 epidemiological survey among 9227 university students from 2 universities showed a prevalence of 3.4% [5]. Facial appearance and features significantly impact a person’s professional, social, and romantic life [6]. The common perception of facial redness is that it signifies anger, embarrassment, or excessive drinking, and this could potentially cause shame in patients with rosacea [7], leading to various sociopsychological impacts and psychological complications, such as social anxiety, shame, and depression; hence, there is a strong desire for treatment among these patients.
        Current clinical treatments for erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (ETR) mainly involve topical and oral vascular regulators and photophysical therapy. Topical treatments with 0.5% brimonidine tartrate gel and 1% oxymetazoline hydrochloride cream [8], which are α-adrenergic receptor agonists, are commonly used. These medications specifically act on the smooth muscles around facial blood vessels, constricting vessels and reducing persistent central facial erythema, but are ineffective on dilated capillaries, papules, or pustules. It is believed that improvement in erythema is only a temporary suppression. The main oral treatment is the β-adrenergic receptor inhibitor carvedilol [8]. Carvedilol has both α1 receptor blocking and nonselective β receptor blocking effects, acting on myocardial β1-adrenergic receptors to slow the heart rate and ease patient tension; this is mainly used for refractory transient flushing and prominent persistent erythema. Despite good patient tolerance, caution is advised for hypotension and bradycardia, with monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure recommended. Some patients experience rebound upon discontinuation. In photophysical therapy, options include intense pulsed light (IPL), pulsed dye lasers, potassium titanyl phosphate lasers, Nd: YAG lasers, and radiofrequency therapy [9]. Laser devices use hemoglobin as a medium, emitting photons or laser beams to denature and coagulate hemoglobin, forming blood clots and damaging endothelial cells within capillaries, reducing telangiectasia and inhibiting vascular proliferation. While laser therapy has advantages for treating telangiectasia, patients with severely compromised skin barriers cannot tolerate the local stimulation of lasers, and the high cost of laser treatment limits its widespread clinical use.
        Collateral puncture therapy is one of the oldest healing methods in human medical history, dating back to the Stone Age, when it was discovered that collateral puncture could alleviate pain [10], leading to the development of medical tools like bian stones. With the progress of history, various acupuncture and collateral puncture tools were developed [11], including acupuncture needles and triangular needles. Collateral puncture therapy involves using needles to puncture superficial small veins, specific acupoints, lesion areas, or pathological reaction points to release a certain amount of blood for treating diseases [12]. “Meridians” in Miraculous Pivot, a classical work in Chinese medical literature, mentions that the main function of collateral puncture therapy is dredging channels and regulating qi and blood for therapeutic effects. In traditional Chinese medicine, the pathogenesis of rosacea is the stagnation of “heat evil” in the facial skin, causing blood coagulation, which aligns well with the disease and makes collateral puncture therapy suitable for its treatment. Additionally, modern medicine recognizes that collateral puncture can improve microcirculation, making it particularly suitable for treating ETR [13].
        Clinically, collateral puncture therapy has been widely applied in the treatment of rosacea and has received positive feedback on its efficacy [14-18]. However, there is currently a lack of high-quality medical evidence to support it. Therefore, this project aims to objectively evaluate the efficacy of collateral puncture therapy on ETR using scientific clinical observation methods.
      
      
        Objectives
        The primary objective is to verify the clinical efficacy and safety of collateral puncture therapy in the treatment of ETR. The secondary objective is to supplement rosacea treatment methods, standardize treatment protocols, and fill a current clinical gap in treating rosacea.
      
    
    
      Methods
      The study protocol was designed in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (Multimedia Appendix 1) [19].
      
        Study Design and Setting
        This is a randomized, controlled, evaluator-blinded trial. Sixty patients were evenly divided into the experimental group and the control group.
      
      
        Recruitment and Informed Consent
        All participants were recruited from Guang’anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Public recruitment advertisements for this trial were used to recruit patients both online and offline (eg, through WeChat public accounts and websites). The researchers determined patient eligibility for this study based on strict application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Interested and willing patients who met the inclusion criteria signed a written informed consent form (Multimedia Appendix 2) before the start of the study. They were fully informed about the study, including its procedures, benefits, and potential risks. Participants were free to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty and without any negative impact on their future medical care.
      
      
        Study Population
        
          Inclusion Criteria
          Patients were included if they (1) met the diagnostic criteria for rosacea as defined in the “Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Rosacea in China (2021 Edition),” [20] specifically the erythematotelangiectatic type; (2) were aged between 18 and 70 years (inclusive); and (3) signed an informed consent form.
        
        
          Exclusion Criteria
          Patients were excluded if they (1) had any systemic or active skin disease on the face that could affect the evaluation of the study results (such as connective tissue disease) or had scars, tattoos, birthmarks, or pigmentary skin diseases on the affected area that could affect the assessment of skin lesions; (2) had serious primary diseases of the heart, cerebral vessels, liver, kidney, or hematopoietic system; mental illnesses or a history of autoimmune diseases; were pregnant or breastfeeding; had photosensitivity; or had a fear of needles; (3) used oral immunomodulators (such as hydroxychloroquine sulfate), β-adrenergic receptor inhibitors (such as carvedilol), or antianxiety drugs (such as mirtazapine and paroxetine) for rosacea treatment within 30 days before treatment; (4) had applied vasoconstrictor drugs on the face (such as 0.5% brimonidine tartrate gel or 1% hydroxymetazoline hydrochloride cream) within 7 days before treatment; used calcineurin inhibitors, antimicrobials, or steroid creams; or had undergone fire-needle therapy, collateral puncture, or LED light treatment on the face; (5) had undergone facial injections, laser treatments, or chemical peels within 30 days before treatment; (6) were currently participating in, or had participated in, another clinical trial within the last 3 months; or (7) could not tolerate any of the procedures involved in the trial.
        
        
          Removal Criteria
          Patients were removed from the study if they (1) showed poor compliance during the trial, affecting the determination of efficacy and safety; (2) experienced serious adverse events, complications, or special physiological changes, making them unsuitable to continue the trial (these were recorded as adverse reactions); (3) were concomitantly using nonprescribed medications, especially those significantly affecting the trial medication, impacting the determination of efficacy and safety; (4) voluntarily withdrew during the trial; (5) withdrew from the trial before completing the course, were lost to follow-up, or died for any reason; or (6) had incomplete data, affecting the judgment of efficacy and safety.
        
      
      
        Randomization and Blinding
        Sixty patients were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group, with 30 in each, using a random controlled method. To avoid selection bias, random numbers were generated using SAS (SAS Institute). The allocations were sealed in opaque, carbonless copy-paper envelopes. After participants agreed to random allocation, they received an allocation sequence number. Upon opening the corresponding envelope, group assignment was determined and recorded in the case report form by a dedicated person. Throughout the study, the evaluators and statisticians were blinded to group allocation.
      
      
        Intervention
        
          Instrument Selection
          The triangular needles used in the study (Huatuo brand disposable acupuncture needles; Suzhou Medical Supplies Factory; production license number 20010020 of the Su Food and Drug Administration of Machinery Production; registration certificate number 20210456). The needle size was 1.6 mm×65 mm. The IPL therapy device was the Icon MaxG (Cynosure LLC).
        
        
          Collateral Puncture Group
          Patients in the experimental group underwent facial collateral puncture therapy at the dermatology department of Guang’anmen Hospital. The selected acupuncture points were ashi points located at the sites of facial telangiectasia. Prior to treatment, the practitioner massaged the chosen areas to induce congestion. During the procedure, a triangular needle was rapidly and shallowly inserted into the skin at an oblique angle to ensure that blood flowed naturally without puncturing blood vessels and causing hematoma. The volume of bloodletting was controlled within the range of 0.5 to 1 ml. The treatment schedule consisted of 1 session of collateral puncture per week for a total of 4 treatments. Throughout the entire trial, collateral puncture procedures were performed by the same acupuncturist (Figure 1).

          The term “ashi point” originates from Sun Simiao’s Essential Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold. These points can be found anywhere on the body and represent a phenomenon known as temporary acupuncture points. When a disease arises, there is a corresponding stagnation of qi and blood in a specific body part, leading to localized and temporary accumulation of qi and blood, thus manifesting the ashi point phenomenon. As the disease subsides, the temporary accumulation of qi and blood dissipates, and the ashi point vanishes. Therefore, according to traditional Chinese medicine, ashi points serve as both indicators of disease and the best stimulation point for treatment.
        
        
          IPL Group
          Patients in the control group underwent facial IPL treatment in the laser department of Guang’anmen Hospital, specifically targeting the localized facial telangiectasia. The IPL wavelengths used were 500 to 670 nm and 870 to 1200 nm, with a spot size of 10 mm×15 mm, a pulse width of 20 ms, and an energy density ranging from 36 to 38 to 40 J/cm2. The overlap of control points was maintained within a 10% range. The treatment protocol consisted of a single session administered upon enrollment, totaling 1 treatment. Throughout the trial, all laser procedures were performed by the same laser physician.

          Primary Outcomes
          The clinician erythema assessment [21] assesses the severity of erythema before treatment, immediately after treatment, and at follow-up. The clinician’s telangiectasia assessment [22] assesses the severity of capillary dilation, classified into 5 grades based on the number and size of dilated vessels, with evaluations conducted before treatment, immediately after treatment, and during the follow-up period.
        
        
          Secondary Outcomes
          The investigator’s global assessment [23] provides an overall assessment of the treatment’s effectiveness immediately after treatment and at follow-up. The patient’s self-assessment [24] assesses the patient’s own perception of the treatment immediately after treatment and at follow-up. The Flushing Assessment Tool [25] assesses facial flushing before treatment and at follow-up. The Dermatology Life Quality Index and Rosacea-specific Quality-of-Life [26,27] tools rate the patient’s quality of life before treatment and at follow-up (Multimedia Appendix 3).
        
      
      
        Sample Size
        With reference to relevant literature, we used a noninferiority trial calculation formula for sample size calculation, as follows:
        n1=[(u1-T+u1-u)e/W]2×(1+c)/c, n2=cn1 [28]
        In the formula, where c=1, n2=n1; setting α=.05, then u1–T=1.64, u1–u=1.28. Based on previous studies using clinician erythema assessment scoring as the primary efficacy end point, e is taken as 0.84, W as 1. Substituting the data into the formula, we calculate n1=n2≈13 [29]. Considering a 30% dropout rate and to enhance data reliability, the final sample size was set at 30 cases per group and 60 cases in total.
      
      
        Data Management and Confidentiality
        The research team will meticulously record the initial data for each participant on the case report form and systematically input them into a secure Microsoft Excel database. Participants’ identities will be anonymized and represented by unique random numbers, ensuring the researchers cannot access their personal information. This approach guarantees stringent data confidentiality. The task of data storage and management, as well as rigorous verification of data accuracy, rests with a designated data custodian. The investigator is responsible for diligently completing each participant’s case report form. The research director will periodically audit the data collection process to maintain its integrity. To safeguard participant privacy, all personal information, including names, contact details, and medical records, will be anonymized and securely stored. Such data will be housed in a specially designated cabinet under the researchers’ custody and preserved for a minimum of 5 years after publication. The Ethics Committee of Guang’anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, will routinely oversee the trial’s progression. This includes monitoring the collection, allocation, and concealment of data and ensuring adherence to ethical standards. The committee holds the authority to propose modifications or terminate the trial if necessary. The Data Monitoring Committee, acting independently from the sponsors and devoid of any conflicts of interest, will provide unbiased oversight of the trial’s data management processes.
      
      
        Adverse Event Reporting and Safety Monitoring
        During the study, adverse reactions could occur at the lesion site, such as local bruising, erythema, edema, pain, itching, blisters, exudation, dry skin, desquamation, acne-like lesions, skin sensitivity, hyperpigmentation, and scarring. If adverse reactions occurred, we recorded the adverse event; if adverse reactions occurred after treatment, we considered their relation to the treatment, reported them promptly to the researcher, and if necessary, stopped the treatment and provided corresponding symptomatic treatment.
      
      
        Ethical Considerations
        The protocol study has received ethical clearance from the Ethics Committee of Guang’anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (2022–127-KY). Patients have the right to withdraw from this study at any time. Prior to enrollment, we ensured that each patient had a clear understanding of the informed consent form, and it was the responsibility of the investigating physician to ensure that every patient provided informed consent before entering the study. The informed consent forms will be retained as part of the clinical study documentation for future reference. We are committed to safeguarding participants’ privacy and confidentiality by anonymizing all data and storing them securely, with access restricted solely to the research team.

      Results
      The research protocol was approved by the Guang’anmen Hospital Ethics Committee on June 24, 2022, and was registered on August 14, 2022. Recruitment commenced on June 1, 2023, with an average of 4 to 6 participants enrolled per month. All patients have been recruited, and we anticipate publishing our research findings by the end of 2025 (Figure 2).
      Statistical analysis will be conducted using SPSS (version 25.0; IBM Corp). Means and SDs will be calculated, and measurement data will be analyzed using 1-tailed t tests and ANOVAs. Nonparametric tests will be used for data not following a Gaussian distribution; the χ2 test will be used for categorical data. Based on previous research outcomes, we anticipate that when comparing the primary and secondary efficacy indicators between the follow-up and baseline periods, scores in both the treatment and control groups will show a downward trend. However, we expect that the decline in scores will be more pronounced in the experimental group.

      Discussion
      We recruited a total of 60 patients with ETR to conduct a randomized, blinded, controlled study, aiming to observe the therapeutic effect of collateral puncture therapy on ETR patients by comparing the outcomes before and after treatment. Our hypothesis is that, compared to patients receiving IPL therapy, those undergoing collateral puncture will exhibit significant improvements in erythema and telangiectasia. To our knowledge, no studies have been reported that directly compare the pure traditional Chinese medicine technique of collateral puncture with IPL for the treatment of ETR. This study intends to fill the gap in the direct comparison between traditional nonpharmacological therapies in Chinese medicine and modern photoelectronic technologies.
      The pathogenesis of rosacea involves contributions from ultraviolet rays, bacteria, demodex folliculiformis, immune dysregulation, neurovascular dysfunction, and genetic factors, among others [20]. Collectively, these etiological agents induce an inflammatory response in the body. IPL therapy for patients with rosacea uses the principle of selective photothermolysis, where the laser specifically targets diseased tissue while sparing adjacent normal tissue, causing thermal damage to dilated capillaries, leading to their coagulation and necrosis [30,31]. Bipolar radiofrequency therapy converts electrical energy into thermal energy through the epidermis to further heat the target tissues. When combined, IPL and bipolar radiofrequency therapy exhibit synergistic effects in reducing dilated capillaries and inflammatory cell infiltration, resulting in favorable therapeutic outcomes. IPL is a commonly used treatment modality for ETR [32]; however, it is relatively costly and has limited efficacy in alleviating symptoms such as facial warmth and itching. Therefore, it was selected as the intervention for the positive control group in this study [33].
      Ying et al [34] found that collateral puncture therapy can reduce the levels of interleukin-1 β, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-6, and cyclooxygenase-2, while increasing the levels of interleukin-4 and interferon γ. This suggests that collateral puncture therapy enhances the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby exerting an anti-inflammatory effect. During treatment, the skin puncturing involved in collateral puncture stimulates the vegetative nervous system, promoting an increase in the secretion of vascular endothelial cells and enhancing the regulatory function of blood vessels. As the collateral puncture disrupts the integrity of blood vessels, it stimulates the function of endothelial cells, leading to the production of a large amount of hormone-like substances that regulate body fluids and blood pressure. Simultaneously, collateral puncture therapy, through physical stimulation causing local capillary rupture, elicits interactive neuroimmune regulation within the microcirculation and also modulates lipid metabolism in the body, reducing the levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and other components in the serum [35]. Furthermore, collateral puncture therapy is a simple and cost-effective procedure, with patients reporting immediate relief from symptoms such as facial heat and itching following the treatment. Therefore, this study adopted collateral puncture therapy as the intervention measure (Figure 3).

      However, this study is also subject to certain limitations. First, previous studies used IPL treatments that were administered once a month, with 3 to 4 sessions constituting one course of treatment. As an exploratory experiment, our study features a shorter treatment duration and a smaller sample size; therefore, the control group received only 1 treatment session. Future research should aim to address these issues by increasing the sample size and extending the observation period while also increasing the number of treatment sessions for both intervention groups and expanding the follow-up period to 6 months or even 12 months, in order to more objectively assess the efficacy of collateral puncture therapy in treating ETR and its ability to inhibit recurrence. Second, the inclusion and exclusion criteria in this study protocol did not fully control for confounding factors. Subsequent studies should further refine these criteria, including restrictions on the type and frequency of skin care products used by patients, as well as their living environments, among other factors. Furthermore, the evaluation indicators designed for this study primarily focused on patients’ erythema, telangiectasia, and quality of life, without assessing changes in facial skin barrier function. Subsequent studies should incorporate relevant evaluation indicators to gain a deeper understanding of the efficacy of collateral puncture therapy. Lastly, this study did not provide detailed specifications for specific quantitative standards and grading of adverse reactions, nor did it monitor systemic safety indicators. Subsequent studies should refine these aspects by incorporating the assessment of safety indicators before and after treatment, such as routine blood tests and infection status, in order to more accurately compare the occurrence of adverse reactions between the two patient groups.
      In summary, collateral puncture therapy for the treatment of ETR possesses a solid theoretical foundation, demonstrates favorable clinical efficacy feedback, is less expensive than photodynamic therapy, and exhibits good safety. However, sufficient clinical evidence to support its use is lacking. The results of this study will provide new insights into the effects and mechanisms of collateral puncture therapy for ETR, thereby complementing the therapeutic options for rosacea, standardizing treatment protocols, potentially reducing disease burden and economic costs, and contributing to both the academic community and the public.

Title: Topical ozone application for severe acne with serological evidence of prior varicella-zoster infection after unsuccessful antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment: a case report

Abstract: BackgroundAcne fulminans is a rare and extreme form of inflammatory acne, which is characterized by the sudden onset of painful, ulcerative nodules and systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, arthralgia, leukocytosis, and potential scarring.Case presentationWe present the case of a 16-year-old white European (Polish) female patient with acne vulgaris that progressively worsened despite treatment with oral isotretinoin, estrogens, topical antibiotics, and corticosteroids. She subsequently developed systemic complications, including fever, malaise, severe musculoskeletal pain, and tachycardia, and was hospitalized, where she received corticosteroids, antibiotics, and isotretinoin; however, the inflammatory and purulent processes persisted. Following discharge, her condition further deteriorated, presenting as severe swelling, pustules, and inflammatory lesions. Upon consulting a different clinic, all previous medications were discontinued, and a treatment regimen involving topical ozone was initiated. This included washing with ozonated water (2.4 ppm) and applying ozonated olive oil (peroxide index 2300) twice daily. The therapy resulted in a rapid reduction of inflammation and purulent lesions, with significant improvement observed within days.ConclusionThis case report suggests a potential benefit of combining ozonated water and ozonated oil as a novel therapeutic approach for refractory acne fulminans.

Body: Introduction
      Acne vulgaris is a common persistent chronic skin inflammatory condition of the pilosebaceous follicles, which affects 9.4% of the global population. It is particularly prevalent among teenagers, with over 85% of individuals experiencing some degree of acne due to hormonal changes that stimulate sebaceous gland activity [1, 2]. While most cases of acne vulgaris are mild-to-moderate and can be managed with topical therapy, severe complications such as acne fulminans can occur. Acne fulminans is rare and the most dangerous complication of acne vulgaris, often treated with oral isotretinoin [3]. This severe form poses a significant therapeutic challenge owing to its inflammatory nature and the increased risk of scarring [1]. Due to its low incidence, there is limited consensus on optimal management, particularly in cases that do not respond to standard therapies such as isotretinoin and corticosteroids [4]. Refractory presentations remain a therapeutic challenge, prompting clinicians to consider novel or adjunctive treatment approaches [5]. Although traditional therapies such as corticosteroids, retinoids, and antibiotics remain widely used, the alternative strategies are under active research. One such emerging treatment option is the application of ozone, which has demonstrated promising antimicrobial [6] and anti-inflammatory properties [7]. In dermatology, it can be used in the form of gaseous ozone, aqueous ozone solutions, and ozonated oils [8].
      Here, we present a clinical case that demonstrates the effectiveness of topical ozone applications in treating severe acne associated with high anti-varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (Ig)G titers where traditional treatments proved to be ineffective.
    
    
      Presentation of the case
      In December 2023, a 15-year-old white European (Polish) female from a family with an average income presented to a dermatologist with complaints of back acne and hair loss. There was no family history of acne. A detailed timeline summarizing the patient’s clinical course, treatments, and outcomes is presented in Fig. 1 to facilitate understanding of the sequence of events.Fig. 1Timeline of clinical events, interventions, and outcomes
      She was prescribed gel formulations of adapalene/benzoyl peroxide and isotretinoin. However, owing to a delay in treatment initiation by the family, she only began taking the medications in May 2024. In June 2024, she returned to the clinic, reporting that the treatment had been ineffective. She was then prescribed oral isotretinoin (20 mg twice daily) and a combination of estrogens (ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg and drospirenone 3 mg), along with over-the-counter topical medications. At 1 month later, she reported a worsening of her condition, characterized by dryness, inflammation, multiple cracks, and lymphatic leakage. The isotretinoin dose was subsequently halved. In August 2024, to improve her condition, she was prescribed prolonged steroids by injection (betamethasone dipropionate and betamethasone sodium phosphate), a 3-day course of the antibiotic azithromycin with weekly repetitions, isotretinoin 20 mg once daily, and clindamycin phosphate topical gel. After 3 weeks, the patient showed worsening inflammation on the facial skin and a marked increase in liver alanine transaminase levels (ALT): 140 IU/L (reference: 7–56 IU/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST): 123 IU/L (reference: 10–40 IU/L). Despite insignificant changes in the general blood test, these findings were interpreted as drug-induced hepatitis. As a result, betamethasone dipropionate and betamethasone sodium phosphate were reintroduced, and the isotretinoin dose was doubled. While laboratory abnormalities were consistent with hepatocellular injury, specific therapeutic adjustments addressing hepatic function were not implemented during this period. Following this adjustment, the formation and suppuration of pustules were observed. A total of 1 week later, the dose of isotretinoin was reduced to 20 mg daily, and azithromycin was added. Within 3 days, the patient developed spine and joint pain. In early September, isotretinoin was discontinued. The following night, the patient experienced a sudden worsening of her general condition, presenting with shortness of breath, chest pain radiating to the left arm, severe back and joint pain, general weakness, a temperature of 37.4 °C, and a heart rate of 150 beats per minute, leading to her admission to the hospital. Upon admission, laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis at 13.4 × 103/μL (reference: 4.5–11.0 × 103/μL), neutrophilia with neutrophils at 78.9% (reference: 40–70%), markedly elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 62.24 mg/L (reference: < 5.0 mg/L), and an elevated d-dimer level of 1509 ng/mL fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU; reference: < 500 ng/mL FEU). The hematological abnormalities indicated active systemic inflammation and suggested an increased risk of septic complications if not promptly addressed. Treatment included intravenous corticosteroids (prednisolone hemisuccinate), spiramycin, and isotretinoin. Nevertheless, the inflammatory and purulent manifestations persisted and showed only partial stabilization after 2 weeks. The patient was discharged from the hospital in late September 2024 with a prescription for corticosteroids (prednisone, for 4 weeks, starting at 20 mg daily and reduced by half each week), spiramycin (15 days), and isotretinoin. A total of 10 days later, the patient experienced increased swelling, inflammation, and purulent manifestations on the skin of the face and eyelids (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Clinical presentation of severe acne characterized by multiple inflammatory papules and pustules on the patient’s cheek prior to ozone application treatment. This condition affected the patient’s lips, chin, and forehead as well
      Clinical examination revealed pronounced erythema with numerous inflammatory papules and pustules, many of which were covered with yellowish crusts suggestive of purulent content. Laboratory tests revealed a CRP level of 16.61 mg/L, mild neutropenia (44.8%), and mild lymphocytosis at 45.9% (reference: 20–40%), which are characteristic of viral process activation. Nevertheless, management at this point continued to focus primarily on acne and scarring prevention. In addition to oral isotretinoin, the patient was prescribed isotretinoin gel and scar-preventing ointment. The following day, the patient visited a different dermatology clinic. Tests revealed a high titer of antibodies to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) (IgG: 1044 mIU/ml, IgM: 0.4 mIU/ml), along with elevated CRP and d-dimer levels. Reference values for VZV IgG are typically considered positive above 100 mIU/mL [9]; thus, the patient’s value of 1044 mIU/mL indicates a strong seropositive status, suggestive of past exposure or reactivation. The prescribed treatment included discontinuation of all previous medications, anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular-weight heparins for 15 days, and initiation of topical ozone application. This consisted of two components. Ozonated water was generated on demand immediately before application using the Ozone Water Generator, model Y4 (ShenZhen BoRun Electronics Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China), achieving an aqueous ozone concentration of 2.4 ppm. Wound washing with ozonated water was performed three times daily. In addition, commercially sourced ozonated olive oil (White Swan, Finland; peroxide index: 2300) was applied topically twice daily. The ozonated oil was prepared by the manufacturer using extra virgin olive oil exposed to continuous bubbling with gaseous ozone, resulting in a stable ozonide-rich formulation suitable for dermatological use. A reduction in inflammatory reactions and purulent processes was observed within the first few days of treatment. During the examination in November 2024, a significant reduction in the inflammatory reaction and a complete absence of purulent and necrotic elements were noted (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Significant improvement in the patient’s condition after 6 weeks of topical ozone application
      Clinical examination revealed marked clearance of inflammatory lesions, with the absence of papules, pustules, and crusts. Residual erythema persisted, indicative of ongoing tissue remodeling and healing. No visible scarring was observed at that time, although the final cosmetic outcome remained to be determined. The treatment response was assessed through serial clinical evaluations and the patient’s self-reported outcomes, which were routinely collected during monthly follow-up consultations at the clinic and through periodic phone communication. To promote tissue regeneration, stimulate fibroblast proliferation, and minimize the formation of deforming scars, platelet-rich plasma and platelet-rich fibrin therapy was prescribed once a month after the signs of active inflammation had subsided. As of January 2025, the disease continues to regress. The patient is currently satisfied with the effectiveness of the new treatment and continues outpatient care aimed at the prevention of the scarring and improving skin trophism. She also continues to use ozonated water and ozonated oil as part of her personal skincare routine.
    
    
      Discussion
      Acne vulgaris has a complex and multifaceted etiology that includes a mix of genetic susceptibility, hormonal fluctuations, lifestyle choices, and environmental influences. It usually starts with hyperkeratinized sebum obstructing hair follicles, followed by inflammation brought on by bacterial colonization [1]. First-line therapy often consists of topical medications such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids, and antibiotics. Oral medications including hormones (oral contraceptives), antibiotics, and retinoids may be administered for the management of moderate and severe cases of acne [10]. Among the alternative methods of acne management were reported treatments with topical probiotics, plant derivatives, and protein derivatives [11, 12].
      Our patient initially presented with severe inflamed acne resistant to conventional treatments, including topical and oral retinoids, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Despite adherence to these regimens, her condition worsened, leading to significant inflammation, fever, chest pain, and severe back and joint pain. This condition, characterized by such systemic symptoms, is known as acne fulminans [3, 13].
      Following consultation at a different dermatology clinic, serological testing revealed a high titer of anti-VZV IgG antibodies. While this finding indicates previous exposure or possible reactivation, no virological testing was performed to confirm active infection, and the patient did not receive antiviral therapy. Therefore, a direct relationship between VZV and the patient’s severe acne could not be established. However, it is worth noting that viral infections, including those caused by herpes viruses, may exert immunomodulatory effects that could influence the severity or course of inflammatory skin conditions [14, 15].
      Ozone application, in the form of an electrolytic ozone aqueous solution and ozonated olive oil, has demonstrated antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and wound-healing properties. The therapeutic effects of ozone in dermatology are largely attributed to its potent oxidative properties [16, 17]. Ozone rapidly reacts with biological membranes, leading to lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and the inactivation of microbial enzymes. This oxidative damage compromises cell membrane integrity and disrupts microbial metabolic functions, resulting in broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, and viruses [18, 19]. The combined application of ozonated water and oil is guided by ozone’s half-life, which is much shorter in aqueous solutions [20, 21]. Conversely, ozonated oil releases ozone slowly over an extended period, thereby prolonging the therapeutic effect [22]. Furthermore, the gel-like form of ozonated oil helps soften hardened comedones and restore the functionality of the skin’s sebaceous glands. In our patient’s case, significant improvement was observed shortly after initiating this treatment. Our observations align with those of Ugazio et al., who described the use of ozonated oils in the treatment of various skin diseases [23]. The research conducted by Silva et al. demonstrated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential of ozonated vegetable oils against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains isolated from diabetic foot ulcers [24]. Similarly, Song et al. showed potent antistaphylococcal effects of ozonated camellia oil, both in vitro and in resolving MRSA-related skin infections following topical application [8]. In addition, Jian et al. reported the successful use of topical ozonated water and oil application in patients with herpes zoster, showing faster clinical improvement compared with conventional treatment with oral valacyclovir and topical mupirocin, and without notable side effects [25]. Furthermore, Ouf et al. investigated the antifungal efficacy of ozonated oil against common dermatophyte species, revealing that ozonated oils were more effective than gaseous ozone in treating superficial fungal infections of the skin, nails, and hair [26]. Ozonated water, produced by dissolving gaseous ozone in water [27] or through water electrolysis [17], has also been successfully used for antibacterial treatment and wound healing. For instance, Hu et al. reported its successful use in flushing diabetic foot ulcers [28]. The patient did not report any side effects of the proposed treatment, which is consistent with the findings of Puxeddu et al., who observed no cytotoxic effects of ozonated olive and sunflower oils on keratinocytes and epithelial cells, despite demonstrating a potent antimicrobial effect on specific microorganisms [29]. In a clinical trial, Lu et al. assessed the efficacy of commercial ozonated oil and laboratory-prepared ozonated water in treating tinea pedis. Their findings showed that there were no adverse effects and that this combination was successful in treating tinea pedis, as verified by mycological analysis [30]. It must be acknowledged that the patient’s clinical improvement could have been partially influenced by the discontinuation of systemic isotretinoin and corticosteroids, which have known potential to exacerbate inflammatory responses in rare cases [5]. In addition, spontaneous remission and a placebo effect, although less likely given the severity and progression of the condition, cannot be entirely excluded as a contributing factor. However, the observed improvement correlated temporally with the initiation of topical ozone therapy, and the known antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of ozonated water and oil provide a plausible mechanism supporting its adjunctive therapeutic role in this case.
    
    
      Limitations
      This report describes a single clinical case without a control group, and causality between the interventions and clinical improvement cannot be definitively established. The absence of virological confirmation of active varicella-zoster infection represents an additional limitation. Larger, controlled studies are needed to validate the clinical efficacy of ozonated water and oil in similar dermatological conditions.
    
    
      Conclusion
      When first-line treatments for severe acne, such as antibiotics and corticosteroids, prove unsuccessful, alternative management strategies should be explored. One such approach may include topical ozone application, utilizing an electrolytic ozone aqueous solution and ozonated olive oil. This case report illustrates the challenges of managing acne fulminans, a severe form of acne that was refractory to conventional treatments. In this patient, the application of ozonated water and ozonated oil as part of the treatment protocol was associated with clinical improvement, including a reduction in inflammation and purulent processes. The observed effects may be related to the well-documented antimicrobial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties of ozone. The combined use of ozonated water and oil potentially provided both immediate and prolonged therapeutic effects, through direct action and slow release of active ozone over time.

Title: Evaluating the efficacy of curcumin plus serratiopeptidase formulation in inflammatory acne: a quasi-experimental study

Abstract: BackgroundAcne vulgaris is one of the most common dermatological illnesses affecting people worldwide. In Pakistan, approximately 9.4% of the population and between 5% and 16% of young adults are affected by acne vulgaris. Conventional therapies (topical benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, antibiotics and oral isotretinoin) are effective but limited by antibiotic resistance and side effects. Curcumin (a natural anti-inflammatory/antimicrobial from turmeric) and serratiopeptidase (a proteolytic enzyme with anti-inflammatory, anti-oedematous and antibiofilm properties) each show promise in acne treatment. This article evaluates the efficacy of a combined oral curcumin plus serratiopeptidase formulation as an adjunct to inflammatory acne therapy.MethodsFifty individuals with mild-to-moderate symptoms of inflammatory acne participated in this quasi-experimental study. They were allocated to standard therapy alone (topical regimen: benzoyl peroxide 5% and adapalene 0.1% gel; oral doxycycline 100 mg once daily) or standard therapy plus a daily curcumin (500 mg) + serratiopeptidase (10 mg) supplement (adjunctive therapy). Acne severity was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) and lesion improvement scale at baseline, 1 week and 2 weeks of treatment. Data were analysed with parametric tests after normalization (log transformation), with significance set at p<0.05.ResultsBaseline characteristics were similar between groups (mean age: 23 years; 66% female). Both groups showed significant improvement in mean VAS (from 7.5 at baseline to 3.1 at 2 weeks; p<0.001). The adjunctive therapy group achieved a markedly higher complete/near-complete improvement rate by week 2 (84% versus 28%; p<0.001). No serious adverse events occurred.ConclusionCurcumin plus serratiopeptidase, as an adjunct to standard therapy significantly, accelerated the resolution of inflammatory acne lesions within 2 weeks, with excellent tolerability. This novel combination targets inflammatory pathways and could reduce reliance on prolonged antibiotics. Larger, longer-term studies are recommended to confirm these findings and evaluate effects on relapse and scarring.

Body: Introduction
      Acne vulgaris is a prevalent condition characterized by persistent inflammation of the pilosebaceous units, manifesting as comedones, papules, pustules or nodules. It is most prevalent in adolescents – up to 85% of teenagers are affected – but also persists into adulthood in a significant proportion (approximately 43–66% in adults).1 Globally, acne ranks among the top ten diseases by prevalence (estimated 9.4% of the world population.2 In Pakistan, community studies report an acne prevalence of 5% in the undergraduate medical students and higher rates (14–17%) in young women.3,4 Beyond its dermatological manifestations, acne can impose a substantial psychosocial burden, with negative effects on self-esteem, social interactions and mental health. Indeed, it has been noted that no single disease causes more psychological trauma than acne vulgaris,5,6 underscoring the need for effective treatment.
      Standard acne therapy is guided by disease severity. Mild acne is managed with topical agents such as benzoyl peroxide and retinoids, with the addition of topical antibiotics (e.g. clindamycin) for inflammatory lesions. Moderate cases often require oral antibiotics (typically tetracyclines) combined with topicals, whilst severe nodulocystic acne warrants oral isotretinoin or hormonal therapy in women.1,7 These treatments target the core pathogenic factors – follicular hyperkeratinization, Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) proliferation, sebum excess and inflammation. However, limitations of current therapies include increasing microbial resistance (especially C. acnes resistance to macrolides and tetracyclines) and adverse effects such as skin irritation (with retinoids/benzoyl peroxide), gastrointestinal upset (antibiotics), and teratogenic or systemic effects (isotretinoin). Consequently, there is growing interest in adjunctive or alternative treatments that are safe and effective and can modulate inflammation without contributing to antibiotic resistance.8
      Curcumin, the active polyphenol in turmeric, has well-documented anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. It downregulates inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF) by inhibiting NF-κB and other signalling pathways, and can exert direct antibacterial effects.9 In dermatology, curcumin and turmeric preparations have been explored for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, wound healing and acne.10 A 2016 systematic review noted that oral or topical curcumin/turmeric products led to significant improvement in the severity of various skin diseases in 10 out of 18 clinical studies, suggesting curcumin as a promising therapeutic agent.11 Specific to acne, curcumin has demonstrated the ability to suppress C. acnes-induced inflammation: for example, blue-light-activated curcumin can inhibit C. acnes in vitro and reduce inflammatory lesions.12 Curcumin is also reported to reduce sebaceous gland activity and lipid peroxidation involved in acne pathogenesis.13 These multifactorial actions make it an attractive adjunct in acne management, especially to mitigate inflammation and bacterial overgrowth.
      Serratiopeptidase (serrapeptase) is a proteolytic enzyme derived from Serratia bacteria, used in systemic enzyme therapy for its anti-inflammatory and fibrinolytic effects. It has been used for decades in Europe and Asia to treat conditions such as arthritis, sinusitis, post-operative swelling and trauma.14,15 Serratiopeptidase hydrolyses inflammatory exudates and dead tissue, thereby reducing oedema and facilitating tissue repair. Additionally, it is a powerful anti-inflammatory agent with analgesic and anti-oedematous properties, and even a degree of antimicrobial activity, particularly against biofilm-forming bacteria.14,16 Notably, in vitro studies show that serratiopeptidase can disrupt bacterial biofilms and enhance antibiotic penetration. Clinically, combining this enzyme with antibiotics has been found to improve outcomes in infectious and inflammatory processes.17 In acne vulgaris, early evidence hinted that serratiopeptidase as an adjuvant could accelerate lesion resolution when added to conventional therapy.18 By cleaving inflammatory mediators and downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (via inhibition of COX1/COX2, 5-LOX and other pathways), serratiopeptidase may rapidly alleviate the redness and pain of inflamed acne lesions. Furthermore, its fibrinolytic action might reduce the likelihood of fibrosis and scarring.15,19
      Curcumin and serratiopeptidase each target inflammatory pathways in acne through complementary mechanisms. We hypothesized that a combination of these two agents would have a synergistic effect in reducing inflammatory acne lesions more quickly and effectively than standard treatment alone. To date, no published clinical trial has evaluated the combined use of curcumin and serratiopeptidase in acne. A recent trial using a different enzyme (bromelain) plus curcumin showed significant reductions in acne-associated inflammation and erythema,20 supporting the concept of enzyme-enhanced anti-inflammatory therapy. We designed this study to fill the research gap and provide evidence on the efficacy and safety of an oral curcumin plus serratiopeptidase formulation as adjunctive therapy in patients with inflammatory acne. The objective was to determine whether adding this combination to standard acne treatment improves clinical outcomes (lesion count and severity) and speeds up recovery compared with standard treatment alone.
    
    
      Materials and methods
      This study employed a non-randomized, quasi-experimental, pre-post design, conducted in tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan between January and June 2024. Participants were assigned based on availability and timing, without randomization. After receiving approval from the institutional ethical review board (reference No. ERC/2024/DERM/129(A)), the research procedure was implemented, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. We enrolled patients with mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris, defined as acne with papules and pustules (with or without comedones), and no more than a few small nodules, corresponding to grade 2–3 acne severity. Group A received standard acne treatment (described below) plus the curcumin/serratiopeptidase supplement, and Group B received standard treatment alone.
      Calculations were made to determine the size of the sample based on an anticipated modest effect size in acne severity reduction with adjunct therapy. Using Cochran’s formula for comparing proportions, we calculated the sample size with the following assumptions: a confidence level of 95%, power of 80%, baseline improvement rate of 50% and expected post-intervention rate of 75% (i.e. a 25% absolute effect size). This yielded a requirement of 22 participants per group. To account for possible attrition and to enhance statistical robustness, we enrolled 25 participants per group (total n=50).20
      Inclusion criteria were age 15–35 years, clinical diagnosis of mild or moderate inflammatory acne (with inflammatory lesion count 10–50), and no acne treatment in the past 4 weeks. Both male and female patients were eligible; female patients of childbearing age had to be non-pregnant (confirmed by test) and using contraception due to the unknown systemic effects of the supplement in pregnancy. Exclusion criteria included severe nodulocystic acne requiring isotretinoin, exclusively comedonal acne (non-inflammatory), any systemic inflammatory disease or immunosuppressive medication use, known allergy to turmeric/curcumin or serratiopeptidase, and use of other herbal or oral acne remedies in the past month. Patients with significant acne scarring or hyperpigmentation were not excluded but those findings were documented separately as they were not the focus of the outcome assessment.
      All participants received standard therapy appropriate for their acne severity as per guidelines.1,7 This consisted of a topical regimen (benzoyl peroxide 5% wash once daily, and adapalene 0.1% gel at night) for all patients. Additionally, a moderate systemic therapy was given to both groups: oral doxycycline 100 mg once daily, as it is a first-line antibiotic for moderate inflammatory acne. Group A (intervention) received an oral supplement capsule containing curcumin (500 mg) plus serratiopeptidase (10 mg), once daily after a meal. Group B (control) received an identical-appearing placebo capsule (filled with inert cellulose) once daily. The supplements (active and placebo) were manufactured and quality-tested to ensure similar appearance and taste. Both groups continued treatment for 4 weeks, which was considered an adequate period to observe initial clinical response and any accelerated improvement due to the supplement. All other aspects of management were kept constant between groups. Patients were provided with a gentle cleanser and non-comedogenic moisturizer and advised on general skincare. No intralesional steroid injections or additional procedures were performed during the study.
      The primary outcome was the change in acne severity over 2 weeks, assessed by two methods: (1) inflammatory lesion counts (number of papules/pustules) on the face, recorded at baseline, week 1 and week 4 for a quantitative secondary outcome. (2) An Investigator’s Global Assessment of improvement, categorized as ‘Improved’ (meaning clear/almost clear or >75% lesion reduction), ‘Partially improved’ (some improvement <75% reduction) or ‘No change/worse’. This simple clinical improvement scale was adapted from prior acne trials and was applied at each follow-up by a dermatologist blinded to group allocation. In addition, a visual analogue scale (VAS) for overall acne severity (patient rated on a 0–10 scale, where 0 = clear skin and 10 = worst-ever severity) was used. This captures the patient’s subjective assessment of their acne’s severity, pain and/or inflammation. The percentage of patients who achieved a decrease in the number of inflammatory lesions by >50% and patient-reported satisfaction at week 2 (yes/no) were secondary outcomes. Safety outcomes included any reported adverse events (with special attention to gastrointestinal discomfort, as serratiopeptidase can cause mild gastrointestinal upset, and to rash or allergy, as curcumin can seldom cause contact dermatitis).
      Participants were evaluated at baseline (Day 0), 1 week (Day 7) and 4 weeks (Day 30). At baseline, demographic data (age, sex) and acne history were noted. A visual grading of acne severity was conducted, and baseline VAS was recorded. At each follow-up, the VAS and investigator improvement scale were recorded, and lesion counts were performed. Lesion counts were manually recorded by the same dermatologist at all-time points to ensure consistency. Although digital photographs were captured at each visit to support documentation, lesion evaluation was based on direct clinical examination. Blinding of the assessor was not implemented due to logistical limitations. Adherence to medications was assessed by capsule count and patient diary. Participants were queried about any side effects or new symptoms at each visit. Compliance with topical and oral standard treatments was also reinforced and recorded.
      
        Statistical analyses
        All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 25. Continuous variables, such as VAS scores and inflammatory lesion counts, were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Categorical variables (e.g. clinical improvement status) were summarized as frequencies and percentages. The normality of continuous data distributions was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Although VAS scores showed mild skewness at follow-up (p<0.05), the distributions were sufficiently symmetrical for group comparisons using parametric methods. Independent samples t-tests were used to compare group differences in VAS scores and lesion counts at each time point (baseline, week 1 and week 4). Between-group comparisons of categorical outcomes, including the proportion of patients achieving ‘Improved’ status or >50% lesion reduction, were performed using the χ2 test. Effect sizes were presented as mean differences or risk differences, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to enhance interpretability. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
      
    
    
      Results
      A total of 60 patients were assessed for eligibility; ten were excluded (six did not meet inclusion criteria and four declined participation). Fifty patients were enrolled (Group A: n=25; Group B: n=25). All completed the 4-week follow-up. Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics. The mean age was 23.0±3.9 years, with an age range of 15–32 years. The sample was 66% female (33/50) and 34% male. The two groups were similar in age distribution and sex ratio (p=0.77 and p=0.45, respectively). At baseline, 63.3% of participants had moderate acne and 38.7% mild acne by clinical assessment. The mean baseline inflammatory lesion count was 22.5±8.4, with no significant difference between Group A and Group B (mean 23.7 versus 20.9; p=0.28). Mean baseline VAS severity scores were also comparable: 7.6±1.3 in the supplement group versus 7.4±1.1 in controls (p=0.54). All patients had facial acne; 12% also had mild truncal acne.
      Both groups showed improvement in acne severity over the 4-week treatment period, but improvements were more pronounced in Group A. Figure 1 illustrates the trajectory of mean VAS scores. At week 1, Group A had a mean VAS of 5.6±1.2 versus 5.1±1.1 for Group B (lower is better). Both were improved from baseline but between-group differences in VAS at 1 week were not statistically significant (p=0.15), indicating that, by day 7, both groups had similar moderate improvements. At 4 weeks, the mean VAS score was 3.1±1.6 in Group A versus 3.1±1.2 in Group B, with a between-group difference of 0.01 (95% CI −0.73 to 0.75; p=0.94), indicating no significant difference in VAS scores.
      Despite this, a striking difference emerged in the distribution of clinical improvement between groups, as assessed by the investigator’s global improvement scale. By week 4, a significantly higher proportion of patients in Group A achieved ‘Improved’ status (84% versus 28%), corresponding to a risk difference of 56% (95% CI 33.3–78.7%; p<0.001) (Table 2).
      A faster and greater reduction in inflammatory lesion count was observed in Group A compared to standard treatment alone (Figure 2). At baseline, both groups had comparable lesion counts, but by week 1, Group A showed a more pronounced reduction (12.4 versus 14.2 lesions). By week 4, Group A had a mean lesion count of 8.1 versus 12.3 in Group B, with a mean difference of −4.2 lesions (95% CI −8.2 to −0.2; p=0.04), favouring the curcumin plus serratiopeptidase group. More patients in group A achieved >50% lesion reduction by week 4 (93% versus 71%; p=0.03), with a risk difference of 22% (95% CI 2.3–41.6%). Notably, 10 (40%) patients in Group A had zero papules/pustules by day 14 (full clearance), compared to 2 (8%) patients in Group B (p=0.02).
      Both treatments were well tolerated. In Group A, 1 (3.4%) patient reported mild epigastric discomfort in the first few days of taking the supplement, which resolved spontaneously and did not require stopping medication. No other significant adverse events were noted in the adjunctive therapy group. In Group B, no adverse events were reported. There were no cases of allergic reactions or abnormal lab results in either group. Specifically, liver function tests at 2 weeks showed no elevation from baseline in the adjunctive therapy group, consistent with the known safety of curcumin at dietary doses. Adherence to the oral supplement was 97% as per pill counts (a total of 5 missed doses among 29 patients), and adherence to doxycycline and topicals was similarly high and not different between groups. Thus, the addition of curcumin plus serratiopeptidase did not compromise compliance or safety. The overall patient-reported satisfaction at 2 weeks was higher in Group A (90% ‘satisfied’ versus 60% in control; p=0.01), reflecting the better clinical outcomes.
    
    
      Discussion
      This study investigated a novel combination of curcumin and serratiopeptidase as an adjunctive therapy for inflammatory acne and found that it significantly enhanced treatment efficacy, especially in achieving faster and more complete lesion clearance. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental study to evaluate this specific combination in acne vulgaris. The results align with and build upon findings from prior studies that individually examined anti-inflammatory supplements for acne. For instance, Mikhael et al. reported that adding serratiopeptidase to routine acne treatment led to quicker improvement in lesion healing.18 Our trial corroborates the beneficial role of serratiopeptidase, now in combination with curcumin, demonstrating a clear adjuvant effect by the 2-week mark. Similarly, the potent anti-acne potential of curcumin observed in earlier research is reflected in our outcomes. A recent split-face trial from China using curcumin-mediated photodynamic therapy (curcumin applied topically and activated by blue light) showed a ~59% reduction in inflammatory lesion counts, significantly superior to light therapy alone.21 We observed an analogous magnitude of inflammatory lesion reduction (80% versus 66% with standard care), achieved with systemic curcumin in a non-light-dependent manner. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial actions of curcumin can translate into meaningful clinical improvement even without photodynamic augmentation.
      The results of our study are likewise in agreement with those obtained by Shojaan et al.,20 who administered an oral supplement containing bromelain and curcumin to individuals with scarring from acne. They found that the enzyme plus curcumin group had significantly reduced erythema and inflammation compared to placebo. Bromelain, like serratiopeptidase, is a proteolytic enzyme with anti-inflammatory effects, and curcumin was postulated to provide synergistic benefits.20 The success of bromelain-curcumin in reducing inflammatory sequelae of acne supports the concept that combining proteolytic enzymes with anti-inflammatory phytochemicals can yield enhanced outcomes. Our study extends this concept to active inflammatory acne lesions and demonstrates clinical efficacy in an acne population. Notably, the time frame of 4 weeks for significant results in our trial is relatively short for acne therapies, which typically require 6–12 weeks for maximal effect. The adjunctive curcumin plus serratiopeptidase appears to accelerate the initial resolution of acne lesions. This is clinically important because faster control of inflammation can prevent long-term sequelae; early reduction of active lesions is known to lower the risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring.22 Indeed, early intervention is a primary goal in acne management to mitigate scarring. By achieving a high clearance rate in just 4 weeks, the curcumin-serratiopeptidase formulation could serve as a valuable booster in acute management of flares or moderate acne cases, possibly shortening the required duration of antibiotic use.
      Pakistani patients often have skin of colour (Fitzpatrick type III–V) and are prone to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation; a faster calming of inflammation (as seen with our supplement) could be particularly beneficial in this context to reduce pigmentary sequelae. Although we did not specifically measure hyperpigmentation outcomes, future studies could evaluate whether adjunct curcumin (which can also reduce melanogenesis) might lessen post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation in acne.
      Another point of discussion is antibiotic stewardship: given the rising antibiotic resistance, especially in C. acnes,8 non-antibiotic alternatives are highly sought. Curcumin has direct antimicrobial effects that might reduce reliance on antibiotics, and serratiopeptidase has been noted to enhance antibiotic activity, allowing potentially lower doses.14 In a broader sense, nutraceutical and herbal supplements for acne are gaining popularity. A meta-analysis of herbal medicine trials in acne found significant efficacy of certain botanical topical treatments.23 Moreover, a 12-week trial of an oral nutraceutical containing antioxidants and anti-inflammatory ingredients showed reductions in acne lesions comparable to antibiotics.24,25
      In our adjunctive therapy group, inflammatory lesion counts were reduced by approximately 80% within just 4 weeks, which is a notably fast and robust response. Standard treatments, such as oral doxycycline combined with topicals, typically show 50–70% lesion reduction over a period of 8–12 weeks, depending on baseline severity and adherence.26 A recent clinical trial using doxycycline with trifarotene reported similar levels of reduction albeit over a longer treatment duration of 8 weeks or more. In contrast, the adjunctive use of curcumin plus serratiopeptidase in our study achieved rapid and marked improvement in just 4 weeks, with 34% of patients showing complete clearance by day 14.27 This suggests that the combination may accelerate the early resolution of acne inflammation.
      Our study also found that curcumin plus serratiopeptidase did not compromise compliance or safety. Although no clinical signs of interaction were observed, curcumin and serratiopeptidase are known to influence drug metabolism pathways (e.g. CYP450, P-glycoprotein). Their co-administration with doxycycline may warrant further pharmacokinetic evaluation in future trials to ensure safety.
    
    
      Conclusion
      In conclusion, this study provides evidence that an oral curcumin plus serratiopeptidase formulation can significantly enhance the treatment of inflammatory acne when used as an adjunct to standard therapy. The combination was associated with faster reduction of inflammatory lesions and a higher rate of near-complete clearance at 4 weeks, without added side effects. These findings support the hypothesis of a synergistic effect between curcumin and serratiopeptidase, leveraging their anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties to target acne pathophysiology. For patients and clinicians, such an adjunct offers a promising option to achieve better and quicker acne control, which is particularly valuable in preventing acne complications and improving patient confidence.
      
        Limitations of the study
        This study has several limitations. The modest sample size and short 4-week follow-up limit conclusions regarding long-term efficacy or relapse. Additionally, potentially relevant variables, such as Fitzpatrick skin type, hormonal influences and dietary factors, were not captured. All patients received standard acne therapy (doxycycline and topicals), which may confound the attribution of effects solely to the adjunctive supplement. Additionally, the study was non-randomized and unblinded; lesion counts were performed by a single assessor without allocation concealment, introducing potential observer bias. Although digital photographs were taken for documentation, automated lesion analysis was not used. Pharmacokinetic interactions between curcumin, serratiopeptidase and doxycycline were not evaluated. Nevertheless, these preliminary findings suggest that curcumin plus serratiopeptidase may offer meaningful adjunctive benefits. Future larger-scale, randomized trials with longer follow-up and comprehensive baseline profiling — ideally with a three-arm design — are warranted to isolate efficacy and validate these outcomes.
